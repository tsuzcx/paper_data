Therefore, there is much need of optimizing the power consumption of such systems. Considering cloud computing to be the focus of this review, we need to make them energy efficient. Up to now, Data Centers have contributed a lot in making cloud computing powerful. Thus, there is an increasing demand for Data Centers and this will tend to increase in future as well. This increase in demand has increased the energy consumption by data centers. Hence, there is an utmost need to take sufficient measures to lower the risk factors associated with increased energy demand. The fundamental objective of this review is to analyze the various techniques that have been implemented so far to reduce the consumption of energy by cloud computing systems. These techniques mainly focus on the virtualization of machines that has proved the revolutionary application area of green IT.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8230012","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08230012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8230012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green cloud computing: A review on efficiency of data centres and virtualization of servers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Green cloud computing: A review on efficiency of data centres and virtualization of servers","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230012/","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17449215","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green cloud computing: A review on efficiency of data centres and virtualization of servers","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"84102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068146S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8230012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230023,"authors":[{"name":"I Mamatha","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Amrita University, India"],"firstName":"I","lastName":"Mamatha","id":"37085553261"},{"name":"Shikha Tripathi","affiliation":["Dept of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Bengaluru Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India"],"firstName":"Shikha","lastName":"Tripathi","id":"37978658500"},{"name":"T S B Sudarshan","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"T S B","lastName":"Sudarshan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8230023","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Filter banks","Convolution","Delays","Maximum likelihood detection","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","discrete wavelet transforms","filtering theory","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution based efficient architecture","high throughput architecture","M point input sequence","L tap wavelet coefficients","N point sequence","block size","poly-phase filter structure","Virtex4 xc4vlx15-10sf363 target device","one dimensional discrete wavelet transform","1D DWT","tap filter","Xilinx ISE tools","functional simulation","frequency 398.25 MHz","N"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1-D DWT","Filter Bank Approach","Polyphase Structure","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this work, a high throughput architecture for 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform is proposed.

The advantage of LS-PWM techniques over PS-PWMs is that they produce better harmonic profile, but the un-equal power distribution problem of LS-PWMs imposes limitation to their usage in high power and medium voltage applications. For achieving the equal conduction periods and to evenly distribute the power among different cells, carrier rotation should be employed in LS-PWM. This paper proposes a carrier rotation strategy introduced to LS-PWM for producing the collective benefit of equal power distribution from PS-PWM and better harmonic profile from LS-PWM. MATALB/Simulink has been used to create simulation models and the experimental validations are performed by a hardware setup using dSPACE-DS1104 R&D Controller board. Furthermore, experimental results for power losses of individual cells, total harmonic distortions (THDs) in output voltages have been measured and compared with the obtained results of traditional LS-PWM techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation

Previous work on TWR is mainly based on the assumption that the channel quality remains constant for one round of data exchange, however, the realistic channel fluctuates over time. In this paper, we study the outage behavior of a decode-and-forward (DF) TWR system over block fading channels where the channel condition may vary between two data transmission phases. Our results reveal that compared with constant-quality channels, the outage performance of the TWR-DF system deteriorates over block fading channels. The results also show that the influence of the change of relay locations on the outage probability over block fading channels is different from that over constant-quality channels. Additionally, the optimal relay location of reaching the minimum outage probability is not affected by the difference of channel quality between two data phases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage performance of two-way decode-and-forward relaying over block fading channels","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230077","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230077.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Outage performance of two-way decode-and-forward relaying over block fading channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230077/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450765","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage performance of two-way decode-and-forward relaying over block fading channels","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2011C31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085582S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230078,"authors":[{"name":"Zongmiao He","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zongmiao","lastName":"He","id":"37086288245"},{"name":"Lingyu Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Lingyu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086292899"},{"name":"Yiou Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yiou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086290076"},{"name":"Xiang Ling","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Ling","id":"37086285881"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230078","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter banks","Prototypes","Optimization","Bit error rate","Interference","OFDM","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","adjacent channel interference","channel bank filters","error statistics","filtering theory","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","sidelobe constraints","filter coefficient optimization","ICI","ISI","stopband energy reduction","sidelobe suppression","NPR condition","bit error rate performance","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channel","filter bank multicarrier modulation","5G system","perfect reconstruction condition","interchannel interference","BER analysis","out-of-band emission","FBMC-OQAM system","optimized windowing based filter","bit error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["filter optimization","FBMC-OQAM","ICI/ISI","stopband energy","NPR"]}],"abstract":"Filter optimization of out-of-band emission plays an important role for FBMC-OQAM system.

New closed-form expressions of the exact secrecy outage probability and the probability of positive secrecy were presented. For further insights, the asymptotic secrecy outage probability in the high SNR region was also derived. It is confirmed that antenna correlation has no effects on diversity order. Most importantly, we concluded that higher antenna correlation at receiver offers more beneficial effects on secrecy performance when average SNR of the main channel is at low level, but it imposes more detrimental effects when average SNR of the main channel is at medium and high level. Finally, we provide Monte Carlo simulations to verify the analytical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230090.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy performance of MIMO wiretap channels with Nakagami-m antenna correlation","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","Nakagami channels","probability","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average SNR","secrecy performance","MIMO wiretap channels","closed-form expressions","exact secrecy outage probability","positive secrecy","asymptotic secrecy outage probability","high SNR region","higher antenna correlation","TAS-MRC scheme","Nakagami-m antenna correlation","antenna correlation","diversity order","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physical layer security","exponential antenna correlation","Nakagami-m fading","MIMO wiretap channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy performance of MIMO wiretap channels with Nakagami-m antenna correlation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230090/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450699","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy performance of MIMO wiretap channels with Nakagami-m antenna correlation","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2024C333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106797S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230092,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Tao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Tao","id":"37086261948"},{"name":"Li Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086322424"},{"name":"Kun Liang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086262338"},{"name":"Bo Zhuo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"37086321591"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230092","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230092","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Matrix converters","DH-HEMTs","Finite element analysis","Standards","Digital video broadcasting","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residue class pair","irregular repeat accumulate low-density parity-check codes","systematic IRA-LDPC codes","parity bits","LDPC codes","parity-check matrix","RCP-based IRA-LDPC codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) codes","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","parity-check matrix","residue class pair (RCP)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new family of irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the characteristic of random-like structure, a common feature of the practical LDPC codes adopted in most communication industrial standards.

Efficient resource allocation and interference management becomes to a challenging issue. In this work, we try to address the co- and cross-tier interference issue for densely deployed femtocell networks in order to acquire the expected performance gain. We propose a two-stage framework. At the first stage, the femtocells are grouped into clusters to mitigate co-tier interference. At the second stage, we aim to maximize the sum throughput of the femtocells while keeping the interference to reference users (RUs) under their bearable thresholds and guaranteeing a set of proportional rate constraints among femto users (FUs) in each cluster. We assign subchannels to the femtocells in each cluster based on an efficient time-sharing method and distribute powers over all subchannels by employing a fast barrier method. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can suppress co- and cross-tier interference effectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering-based resource allocation strategy with proportional rate constraints for densely deployed femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230117","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230117.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Clustering-based resource allocation strategy with proportional rate constraints for densely deployed femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230117/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450762","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering-based resource allocation strategy with proportional rate constraints for densely deployed femtocell networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2051C145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083397S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230120,"authors":[{"name":"Junsu Wang","affiliation":["China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Junsu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086312018"},{"name":"Xuemei Huang","affiliation":["China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086312665"},{"name":"Jin Jia","affiliation":["China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086311339"},{"name":"Biao Li","affiliation":["China Automotive Engineering Research Institute Co., Ltd., Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086314597"},{"name":"Wenhan Yang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wenhan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086314676"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230120","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Throughput","Interference","Clustering algorithms","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","mobility management (mobile radio)","OFDM modulation","pattern clustering","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","set theory","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonoverlap set","heuristic subcarrier pairing based power allocation algorithm","resource allocation","OFDMA mobile networks","clustering algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multicell cellular networks","heterogeneous user equipment","OFDMA system","multicell cellular system","user equipment clustering","network structure","virtualized network","cloud-based network","subcarrier problem","mobility-driven network","overlap set","Lagrange based power allocation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobility-driven","networks","OFDMA","resource allocation","user clustering"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is considered as a promising technique to overcome interference in multi-cell cellular networks. However, the mobility of heterogeneous user equipment brings new challenge to traditional OFDMA network. The current research about OFDMA system mostly based on multi-cell cellular system that is not perfectly compatible with the future networks, for example, the cloud-based and virtualized network. In this paper, we introduce the subcarrier and power allocation problem from traditional cellular network to a recently proposed mobility-driven network (MDN) which is quite novel and has an intrinsic feature of mobility combined with user equipment clustering. Firstly, such network structure is dynamically constructed based on the clustering result and the subcarriers are allocated to each cluster. Then by dividing the subcarriers to non-overlap set and overlap set, a Lagrange based and a heuristic subcarrier pairing based power allocation algorithm are respectively applied to these two sets. Simulation result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm improves both the throughput and energy efficiency, compared to the traditional scheme in current network.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230120","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230120.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation in OFDMA mobile networks based on clustering algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230120/","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation in OFDMA mobile networks based on clustering algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450767","htmlLink":"/document/8230120/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation in OFDMA mobile networks based on clustering algorithm","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2054C1035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070928S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230143,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Luo","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086903643"},{"name":"Su Zhao","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications & Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38241143000"},{"name":"Qi Zhu","affiliation":["Key Lab on Wideband Wireless Communications and Sensor network Technology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37535153600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230143","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230143","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Silicon","Quality of service","Delays","Analytic hierarchy process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic hierarchy process","quality of service","radio networks","TOPSIS"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic hierarchy process","network attributes","TOPSIS","attribute utility","QoS requirements","multiservice terminal","synthesized weight vector","multimode terminals","heterogeneous wireless networks","group decision","network selection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network selection","multi-service terminal","group decision making","QoS requirement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230143","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230143.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network selection algorithm based on group decision making for heterogeneous wireless networks","abstract":"Multimode terminals running multiple services at the same time are increasingly common, in response to this phenomenon, a network selection algorithm based on group decision making for heterogeneous wireless networks is presented in this paper.

The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is far superior to the TOPSIS in satisfying the QoS requirements of different class of services, and can solve the problem of network selection for a group of services from a multi-service terminal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230143/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17450808","publicationDate":"May 2017","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230143/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Network selection algorithm based on group decision making for heterogeneous wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network selection algorithm based on group decision making for heterogeneous wireless networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2077C1050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085223S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8230151,"authors":[{"name":"Shuzhu Tang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shuzhu","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086901462"},{"name":"Dawei Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085995236"},{"name":"Peng You","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"You","id":"37085993952"},{"name":"Shaowei Yong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Yong","id":"37085992956"},{"name":"Shenda Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shenda","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086157939"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230151","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MultiObjective optimization deployment of HAP broadband communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband communication","Optimization","Directive antennas","Downlink","Gain","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","genetic algorithms","high altitude stratospheric platforms","Pareto optimisation","sorting","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto front","constrained multiobjective optimization problem","NSGA-2","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm 2","CDMD","capacity-demand matching degree","aggregate broadband efficiency model","base station","mutual restriction optimization objectives","network coverage","communication downlink performance","multiobjective optimization deployment method","high altitude platform","stratospheric broadband communication system","Space Information Network","HAP broadband communication networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high altitude platform","Broadband Communication Network","multiobjective optimization","deployment method","downlink performance","NSGA-2"]}],"abstract":"In the Space Information Network, the stratospheric broadband communication system has unique advantages due to the usage of high altitude platform (HAP) as its base station.

In order to reduce inter-tier interference during channel estimation, proposed scheme assigns mutually orthogonal pilots between macro-cells and small-cells, and pilots are reused among macro-cells with different pilot reuse factors. Comprehensive analyses and simulations of uplink average signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and average achievable ergodic rate for the proposed scheme are developed. Simulation results show that the proposed PA scheme can reduce pilot contamination and improve the SINR and ergodic rate at base stations (BSs). In addition, the average SINR increases when pilot reuse factor grows, which shows the benefit of the proposed scheme. The average ergodic rate first becomes larger and then becomes smaller when pilot reuse factor becomes larger, which means the large number of pilot symbols limits the increase of ergodic rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks

spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. However, for frequency division duplexing (FDD) system, the cost of CSIT feedback becomes a bottleneck with the BS antennas increasing. To reduce the cost of the downlink training and the CSIT uplink feedback, joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) scheme is proposed by Ansuman Adhikary, et al., which divides users into different groups according to their channel covariance eigenvectors and adopts the two-stage precoding. In this paper, a Density Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) user grouping algorithm is proposed for JSDM scheme, which divides all the users based on the density distribution of users. DBSCAN can find the groups with arbitrary shape and size, while DBSCAN has two parameters which is hard to determine. In this paper the parameters are determined by detecting the density distribution using k-dist graph. The simulation results show that the proposed DBSCAN grouping algorithm has better performance than K-Means and K-Medoids.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230153","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230153.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density based user grouping for massive MIMO downlink in FDD system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230153/","displayDocTitle":"Density based user grouping for massive MIMO downlink in FDD system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450903","htmlLink":"/document/8230153/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density based user grouping for massive MIMO downlink in FDD system","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2087C59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053926S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230157,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086296287"},{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Daiming","lastName":"Qu","id":"37274417000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230157","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230157","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Downlink","Parity check codes","Phase shift keying","Receivers","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink OFDMA systems","low density parity-check codes","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","OFDM systems","PAPR reduction scheme","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access systems","IS-LDPC codewords","invertible symbol subsets","system overhead","system design","remarkable PAPR reduction performance","invertible subset LDPC codes","error correction performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","PAPR","LDPC","invertible subset"]}],"abstract":"A new family of low density parity-check (LDPC) codes, called as invertible subset LDPC (IS-LDPC) codes, was proposed for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in OFDM systems recently. In this paper, we propose a PAPR reduction scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) systems based on IS-LDPC codes. The proposed scheme maps the invertible subsets of IS-LDPC codewords onto subcarriers to construct invertible symbol subsets. Then, the invertible symbol subsets are inverted independently for reducing the PAPR of downlink OFDMA systems. There is no need to transmit the side information by extra channels, which significantly reduces the system overhead and eases the system design. Simulation results show that the PAPR reduction scheme based on IS-LDPC codes produces remarkable PAPR reduction performance and good error correction performance in downlink OFDMA systems.

Finally, the results of simulations show that joint precoding scheme achieves the markedly performance of spectral sidelobes suppression and PAPR reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding for joint spectral sidelobes suppression and PAPR reduction in OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230159","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230159.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Precoding for joint spectral sidelobes suppression and PAPR reduction in OFDM system","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230159/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450664","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding for joint spectral sidelobes suppression and PAPR reduction in OFDM system","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2093C245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067549S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230160,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Li","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.

In this paper, a low-complexity signal detection method in an iterative way is proposed to avoid the complicated matrix inversion. The convergence proof and complexity analysis of the proposed method are provided in detail. The analysis shows that the proposed method can effectively reduce the complexity by one order of magnitude. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms recently proposed Neumann series approximation method. Near-optimal performance of the MMSE method can be achieved with only a small number of iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230160","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","startPage":"487","endPage":"491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity detection method based on iteration for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity detection method based on iteration for massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230160/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450653","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230160/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity detection method based on iteration for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2094C267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068995S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230161,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuyin He","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qiuyin","lastName":"He","id":"37086263478"},{"name":"Shilian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shilian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599722300"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085506952"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230161","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Underwater acoustics","Frequency-domain analysis","Equalizers","Bandwidth","Doppler effect","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","equalisers","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis","time-varying channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalization complexity","underwater acoustic channels","acoustic communication systems","multipath channels","underwater acoustic OFDM system","underwater acoustic signal","frequency-domain channel matrix","receiver time-domain window","MMSE","OFDM system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","underwater acounstic channels","iterative equalization","intercarrier interference"]}],"abstract":"Underwater acoustic communication systems use a bandwidth that is comparable to the center frequency of the signal and qualify as broadband in a relative sense. And underwater acoustic channels are time-varying and multipath channels, giving rise to serious inter-symbol interference (ISI), inter-carrier interference (ICI) and time-domain telescopic changes in the underwater acoustic OFDM system. In this paper, we use a multiband OFDM system by dividing the available frequency band of the underwater acoustic signal into multiple sub-bands, and the channel in each sub-band can be regarded as the time-varying channel of Doppler shift. Then minimum mean square error (MMSE) iterative equalization based on soft information is adapted to counteract the ICI. At the same time, we exploit the banded structure of the frequency-domain channel matrix, as well as a receiver time-domain window that enforce this banded structure. This method leads to a considerable reduction in the equalization complexity while get a better bit error rate (BER) performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity MMSE iterative equalization for multiband OFDM systems in underwater acoustic channels","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230161","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230161.pdf","startPage":"492","endPage":"497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity MMSE iterative equalization for multiband OFDM systems in underwater acoustic channels","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230161/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450830","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity MMSE iterative equalization for multiband OFDM systems in underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2095C297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062011S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230163,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["Key laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, (Anhui University) Ministry of Education, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085820644"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Key laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, (Anhui University) Ministry of Education, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37068538100"},{"name":"Peng Ma","affiliation":["Key laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, (Anhui University) Ministry of Education, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086306675"},{"name":"Chaochao Jia","affiliation":["Key laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, (Anhui University) Ministry of Education, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chaochao","lastName":"Jia","id":"37086310215"},{"name":"Kai Li","affiliation":["Technology and Innovation Department, Shanghai Research Center for Wireless Communication, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Li","id":"37085901858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230163","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink massive MIMO systems","maximum-ratio combining","user scheduling algorithm","zero-forcing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["large number of antennas","achievable uplink rate","supportive number of users","massive MIMO"]}],"abstract":"The supportive number of users achieving the maximum sum rate is studied in uplink massive MIMO systems for zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum-ratio combining (MRC).

The existing CS-based channel feedback schemes, however, adopt Gaussian random matrices to compress the channel, which will impose an unreachable memory and computation requirement on user equipment (UE). In this paper, a new Toeplitz-structured measurement matrix is proposed to perform efficient channels compression in massive MIMO system. Instead of containing entries of are independent realizations of random variables with certain distributions, Toeplitz matrices have constant diagonals, leading a significant reduction of UE requirement for storing and computation. Based on such matrices, we introduce novel feedback mechanism improving further the feedback efficiency for frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Simulation results show that the Toeplitz-structured matrices perform comparably with Gaussian random matrices while requiring less independent random variables and computation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230164","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230164.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toeplitz-structured measurement for compressed channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230164/","displayDocTitle":"Toeplitz-structured measurement for compressed channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17467165","htmlLink":"/document/8230164/","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toeplitz-structured measurement for compressed channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO system","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2098C349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052467S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230165,"authors":[{"name":"Mingjian Chen","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Mingjian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086331364"},{"name":"Guoqing Long","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Long","id":"37086334264"},{"name":"Shiyou Dong","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Shiyou","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086332285"},{"name":"Yan Zhao","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086334051"},{"name":"Jin Cai","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Institute, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086288217"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230165","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars use spatial diversity to improve the performance of the radar.

Choosing Kunming and Wuhan as locations of the optical ground stations, the atmospheric aerosol effects on satellite-ground optical communication links, including attenuation and background scattering, are analyzed. Results show that Kunming station almost unaffected by aerosols, while Wuhan station suffers a lot as a result of lower altitude. Because of aerosol scattering, 3dB attenuation is limited in zenith angle 0\u00b0~60\u00b0 at Wuhan station and sky radiance is almost 8 times of that of clear sky.

light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are the important factors that constrain the high-speed transmission of visible light communication (VLC). As a LED lamp includes multiple LED chips and the superposition characteristics of light is approximately linear, a multi-LED optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is proposed. The multiple LED chips are used to transmit multiple asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) and unipolar OFDM (U-OFDM) signals in parallel, while the signals can be recovered at the receiver. When adopting the same M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), its spectral efficiency is higher than the conventional ACO-OFDM system. The power of the multi-LED transmission system is split equally to each branch, and the amplitude range of the signal is smaller, thus it has better anti-nonlinearity performance. At last, its advantages are verified by the simulation comparisons with other optical OFDM systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-LED optical OFDM modulation for visible light communication","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230189","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230189.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-LED optical OFDM modulation for visible light communication","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230189/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450715","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-LED optical OFDM modulation for visible light communication","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2123C3014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047999S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230196,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tian","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086326011"},{"name":"Jian Liu","affiliation":["Communication Satellite Department, China Academy of Space Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086304807"},{"name":"Shuai Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899733100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230196","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"In order to solve the multipath effect and non-ideal channel characteristics for unmanned aerial vehicle data link, this paper introduces the design of adaptive cascaded equalizer and its FPGA implementation.

Another important feature of the proposed scheme lies in the variable number of transmitting antennas selected for data forwarding. The performance of the proposed scheme, in terms of average channel capacity and average network lifetime, is validated by Monte Carlo simulations.

A method of constant envelope robust waveform design for MIMO radar based on maximum mutual information (MI) criterion is proposed for this problem. Firstly, under the condition that the estimation errors of power spectral density of the target impulse response (TIR) and that of noise are both bounded, an optimization model is constructed, which treats maximizing the MI of target with the corresponding received echo as the objective function, and treats the emission energy as the constraint condition. Finally, Gaussian randomization method is used to obtain the desired constant envelope robust waveform according to the obtained power spectral density, which improves the parameter estimation performance of the MIMO radar system in the worst case.

This method can avoid the premature and improve the poor capability of local optimization of the traditional genetic algorithm. Alternatively implementing the two kinds of genetic breeding operations can effectively alleviate the dependence of the algorithm's convergence on the choice of the initial group. This paper takes the nine-ringed concentric circular array as simulation object. The results show that the number of array elements can be decreased from 278 to 140 with the simultaneous reduction in peak sidelobe level to -21.27dB, and the distortion of mainlobe is avoided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230242/","accessionNumber":"17450698","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230242/","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pattern synthesis of sparse concentric circular array based on the niche genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern synthesis of sparse concentric circular array based on the niche genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2176C1051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056577S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8230246,"authors":[{"name":"Junyan Tan","affiliation":["College of IoT Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Junyan","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085880198"},{"name":"Yan Han","affiliation":["College of IoT Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Han","id":"37086307613"},{"name":"Nianfang Zhu","affiliation":["College of IoT Hohai University, Changzhou, China"],"firstName":"Nianfang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086309160"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230246","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"abstract":"With the growing complexity in consumer embedded systems, the emerging SoC architectures integrate numerous components for the different signal processing tasks. SoC community is exploring 3D technology for the next generation of large SoC with 3D NoC. 3D design technology resolves the vertical inter-layer connection issue by TSVs. However, TSVs occupy significant silicon estate which limits the inter-layer links of the 3D NoC. Therefore, the task mapping on 3D NoC must be judicious in large SoC design. In this paper, we propose a partition algorithm for the task mapping with TSV minimization in SoC architecture. This algorithm contains divergence stage and convergence stage. Our algorithm supplies multi-way min-cut partitioning to gradually divide a given design layer by layer in the divergence stage in order to get an initial solution, then this solution is refined in convergence stage. The experiments show that our proposed algorithm performs a better capacity in the partitioning of the signal processing application.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230246.pdf","startPage":"924","endPage":"928","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast partitioning algorithm on the 3D network on chip architecture for the signal processing application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Three-dimensional displays","Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Signal processing algorithms","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","integrated circuit design","iterative methods","logic design","minimisation","network-on-chip","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon estate","signal processing tasks","multiway min-cut partitioning","divergence stage","SoC architecture","partition algorithm","SoC design","inter-layer links","TSVs","vertical inter-layer connection issue","3D design technology","3D NoC","SoC community","emerging SoC architectures","consumer embedded systems","chip architecture","fast partitioning algorithm","convergence stage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D NoC partitioning","TSV","layer-aware","divergence","convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"A fast partitioning algorithm on the 3D network on chip architecture for the signal processing application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230246/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450804","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast partitioning algorithm on the 3D network on chip architecture for the signal processing application","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2180C137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077349S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230247,"authors":[{"name":"Su Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086331301"},{"name":"Qing Zhu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37576453400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230247","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gesture recognition","Assistive technology","Feature extraction","Image color analysis","Image recognition","Convolution","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","feature extraction","image classification","image segmentation","natural language processing","neural nets","sign language recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sign language recognition task","Chinese sign language recognition","convolutional neural network","CNN","computer vision tasks","video-based recognition approach","CSL","upper body images extraction","gesture recognition","pretraining convolutional network model","hand-shape segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sign language recognition","convolutional neural network (CNN)","deep learning","skin-color model"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used in computer vision tasks recently and achieved remarkable success.

However, due to the horizontal-longnitudinal coherence of the underwater signal, it is impossible to increase the resolving power by aperture extending unrestrictedly. A new DOA estimation method by using compressive sensing with passive synthetic aperture (PSA) is proposed to obtain the higher resolution. Firstly, the PSA technique is used to obtain a virtual aperture, on this basis, and then the compressive sensing is adopted to estimate the target azimuth. In the simulation experiments, the proposed method can distinguish two targets whose angle difference is only 2\u00b0, and it also have high probability of success estimation in low SNR. In the water tank experiments, the proposed method can clearly distinguish three adjacent targets which can not be distinguished by the PSA alone. This proposed method has great application value in the high resolution positioning of underwater vehicle with short array.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230250.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"947","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA estimation based on compressive sensing with passive synthetic aperture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Compressed sensing","Azimuth","Storage tanks","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","signal resolution","sonar arrays","sonar signal processing","synthetic aperture sonar","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial resolution","underwater target","horizontal-longnitudinal coherence","underwater signal","DOA estimation method","compressive sensing","passive synthetic aperture","higher resolution","PSA technique","virtual aperture","target azimuth","adjacent targets","high resolution positioning","physical aperture","success estimation probability","short array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["array signal processing","compressive sensing","passive synthetic aperture","DOA estimation","high resolution positioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation based on compressive sensing with passive synthetic aperture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230250/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450748","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation based on compressive sensing with passive synthetic aperture","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2184C332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045919S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230270,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqing Qian","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yongqing","lastName":"Qian","id":"38492053100"},{"name":"Weizhen Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Weizhen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086086653"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230270","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech processing","Compressed sensing","Discrete cosine transforms","Bayes methods","Matching pursuit algorithms","Energy measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","discrete cosine transforms","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","speech coding","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT domain","sparse coefficient","sparse signal","speech frame signal","adaptive Bayesian compressed sensing","neighboring speech frame","recovery speech signal","adaptive Bayesian Compressed Sensing","Discrete Cosine Transform domain","sub-Nyquist sampling rate","compressible signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian compressed sensing","energy adaption","position adaption","speech frame"]}],"abstract":"Compressed Sensing (CS) is an emerging theory which can sample the sparse signal or compressible signal via sub-Nyquist sampling rate and reconstruct the original signal with small amount of measurements.

The experimental results prove that our proposed method is surely effective and practical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bayesian compressed sensing based on speech frame signal","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230270","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230270.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bayesian compressed sensing based on speech frame signal","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230270/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450656","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bayesian compressed sensing based on speech frame signal","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2204C339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041091S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230274,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Chen","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086270196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230274","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"abstract":"In this paper, an improved nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm is proposed for single channel blind source separation and applied to speech enhancement.

We propose a modified ideal ratio mask (IRM) which calculated by normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC). Then, we jointly optimize the modified ideal ratio mask and deep neural network (DNN).

This leads to poor performance or even failure of most face recognition algorithms. As a consequence, identifying the face of the query in low resolution, based on the high-resolution image gallery, proves to be a huge challenge. To address this problem, a novel multi-resolution convolutional neural network (MRCNN) model is proposed in order to study the consistent feature representation from high-resolution and low-resolution face images. First, the corresponding labeled multi-resolution face images are utilized to train the MRCNN model. After this process, the trained model is used as the feature extractor in order to obtain features for the targets in the gallery and query images, respectively. Finally, the nearest neighbor method is applied as the classifier for the purpose of final identification. The experimental results from the two publicly available databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MRCNN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170168/8230062/08230292.pdf","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1161","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 9th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN)","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2017.8230292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-resolution face recognition via convolutional neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image resolution","Databases","Face recognition","Face","Probes","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image representation","image resolution","image retrieval","neural nets","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-resolution face recognition","real-world video surveillance applications","high-resolution image gallery","novel multiresolution convolutional neural network model","low-resolution face images","MRCNN model","trained model","feature representation","labeled multiresolution face images","feature extractor","query images","nearest neighbor method","image classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","low resolution","convolutional neural network","feature representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-resolution face recognition via convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230292/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17450642","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-resolution face recognition via convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"2226C205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086763S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170168","isNumber":"8230062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170168","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8230062","articleId":"8230292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230320,"authors":[{"name":"Dongfang Ren","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongfang","lastName":"Ren","id":"37086312581"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533188500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3822-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3820-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3823-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-8489"}],"articleNumber":"8230320","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Radio frequency","Fingerprint recognition","Transforms","Histograms","Support vector machines","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","feature extraction","Hilbert transforms","image colour analysis","image texture","marine communication","ships","statistical analysis","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-frequency-energy distribution","TFED","nonstationary signal","empirical mode decomposition","gray image","image texture features","Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix","RF fingerprints","specific emitter identification","intrinsic time-scale-decomposition","radio emitters","external measurement features","radio frequency fingerprints","network intrusion detection","Cognitive Radio","SEI method","Intrinsic Time-scale Decomposition","ITD","ship signals","GLCM","histogram statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SEI","TFED spectrum","ITD","texture features"]}],"abstract":"Specific emitter identification (SEI) aims at discerning radio emitters using external measurement features called the radio frequency (RF) fingerprints of the signal.

The trained networks are applied to real data consisting of fundamental mode Love and Rayleigh phase and group velocity maps. For each inversion, performed on a 2\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 grid globally, we obtain the a posteriori probability distribution of Moho depth. From this distribution any desired statistic such as mean and variance can be computed. The obtained results are compared with current knowledge of crustal structure. Generally our results are in good agreement with other crustal models. However in certain regions such as central Africa and the backarc of the Rocky Mountains we observe a thinner crust than the other models propose. We also see evidence for thickening of oceanic crust with increasing age. In applications, characterized by repeated inversion of similar data, the neural network approach proves to be very efficient. In particular, the speed of the individual inversions and the possibility of modelling the whole a posteriori probability distribution of the model parameters make neural networks a promising tool in seismic tomography.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03373.x","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8230426/08230456.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"722","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03373.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global crustal thickness from neural network inversion of surface wave data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Global crustal thickness from neural network inversion of surface wave data","volume":"169","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global crustal thickness from neural network inversion of surface wave data","sourcePdf":"1692706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022802S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"8230426","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8230456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8230458,"authors":[{"name":"Saumen Maiti","firstName":"Saumen","lastName":"Maiti"},{"name":"Ram Krishna Tiwari","firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Krishna Tiwari"},{"name":"Hans-Joachim K\u00fcmpel","firstName":"Hans-Joachim","lastName":"K\u00fcmpel"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8230458","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230458","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ANN","back propagation method","KTB boreholes","lithofacies","petrophysics","well log"]}],"abstract":"A novel approach based on the concept of super self-adapting back propagation (SSABP) neural network has been developed for classifying lithofacies boundaries from well log data. The SSABP learning paradigm has been applied to constrain the lithofacies boundaries by parameterzing three sets of well log data, that is, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray obtained from the German Continental Deep Drilling Project (KTB). A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks model was generated in a supervised feed-forward mode for training the published core sample data. A total of 351 pairs of input and output examples were used for self-adaptive network learning and weight and bias values were appropriately updated during each epoch according to the gradient-descent momentum scheme. The actual data analysis suggests that the SSABP network is able to emulate the pattern of all three sets of KTB data and identify lithofacies boundaries correctly. The comparisons of the maximum likelihood geological sections with the available geological information and the existing geophysical findings over the KTB area suggest that, in addition to the known main lithofacies boundaries units, namely paragneisses, metabasites and heterogeneous series containing partly calc-silicate bearing paragneisses-metabasites and alternations of former volcano-sedimentary sequences, the SSABP neural network technique resolves more detailed finer structures embedded in bigger units at certain depths over the KTB region which seems to be of some geological significance. The efficacy of the method and stability of results was also tested in presence of different levels of coloured noise. The test results suggest that the designed network topology is considerably unwavering for up to 20 per cent correlated noise; however, adding more noise (\u223c50 per cent or more) degrades the results. Our analyses demonstrate that the SSABP based approach renders a robust means for the classification of complex lithofacies successions from the KTB borehole log data and thus may provide useful guide/information for understanding the crustal inhomogeneity and structural discontinuity in many other regions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03342.x","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8230426/08230458.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"746","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03342.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network modelling and classification of lithofacies using well log data: A case study from KTB borehole site","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural network modelling and classification of lithofacies using well log data: A case study from KTB borehole site","volume":"169","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230458/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network modelling and classification of lithofacies using well log data: A case study from KTB borehole site","sourcePdf":"1692733.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056117S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"8230426","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8230458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8230645,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The semiconductor material GaN has proven its capacity for high power amplifiers, robust receive components as well as switch components for separation of transmit and receive mode. This paper will describe the design and measurement results of a GaN-based single-chip T/R module frontend (HPA, LNA and SPDT) using UMS GH25 technology and covering the frequency range from 8 GHz to 12 GHz. Key performance parameters of the frontend are 13 W minimum transmit (TX) output power over the whole frequency range with peak power up to 17 W. The frontend in receive (RX) mode has a noise figure below 3.2 dB over the whole frequency range, and can survive more than 5 W input power. The large signal insertion loss of the used SPDT is below 0.9 dB at 43 dBm input power level.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230630","publicationTitle":"2017 12th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 12th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8189162/8230630/08230655.pdf","doi":"10.23919/EuMIC.2017.8230655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMIC.2017.8230655","startPage":"41","endPage":"44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance GaN single-chip frontend for compact X-band AESA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230655/","displayDocTitle":"High performance GaN single-chip frontend for compact X-band AESA systems","htmlLink":"/document/8230655/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17452035","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance GaN single-chip frontend for compact X-band AESA systems","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071656S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8189162","isNumber":"8230630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8189162","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8230630","articleId":"8230655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8230661,"authors":[{"name":"Hatem Ghaleb","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Hatem","lastName":"Ghaleb","id":"37086017547"},{"name":"Mohammed El-Shennawy","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"El-Shennawy","id":"38300913100"},{"name":"Corrado Carta","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Corrado","lastName":"Carta","id":"37565299900"},{"name":"Frank Ellinger","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ellinger","id":"37275628500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-048-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3966-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8230661","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230661","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Gain","Switches","Frequency measurement","Switching circuits","Power generation","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","coupled circuits","field effect MIMIC","Ge-Si alloys","integrated circuit modelling","millimetre wave oscillators","quadrature amplitude modulation","semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regenerative gain","high-frequency gain","simultaneous regeneration","mm-wave range","data rates","nonlinear model","phase regeneration","startup behavior","cross-coupled circuit","oscillation frequency","BiCMOS technology","regenerative sampling oscillator","dc power","CADENCE","frequency 147.6 GHz","size 0.13 mum","gain 36 dB","power 38 mW","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modeling","radio frequency","sub-terahertz","sub-THz","wireless communication"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a regenerative sampling oscillator for the simultaneous regeneration of phase and amplitude, which enables highly efficient QAM schemes in the mm-wave range to reach multi-Gb/s data rates.

This PA complies with the long-term evolution (LTE) power level requirements while offering a high efficiency. The MASMOS\u00ae transistor, available in low-cost 180-nm standard CMOS process, provides a higher breakdown voltage compared to conventional CMOS transistors. Therefore, the MASMOS\u00ae transistor is of high interest as it is able to generate a Watt-level output power with high efficiency in the highest LTE-bands.

This IC, easily adaptable for 12W & 25W applications, can be used as a driver or as a Doherty PA. For driver applications, the Proof of Concept demonstrates very flat performances over 3200\u20134000 MHz with high Gain, good Linearity and high Efficiency performances in class AB. Linear Gain is better than 27 dB with P3dB=42.8 dBm and 45.5 dBm respectively for both versions. Drain Efficiency remains better than 54% at P3dB. In Doherty configuration, those ICs have confirmed their ability to be used with complex LTE signals. With symmetric ICs, good linearity performances can be achieved even when the part is driven with up to 200MHz wideband LTE signal. The asymmetric POC delivered a P3dB of 44.5 dBm over the 3400\u20133600 MHz band with at least 25 dB linear Gain. Driven with 3 carrier LTE signal (60MHz), drain Efficiency is better than 40% at 8dB OBO. With respect to the state of the art, to the best of our knowledge, it is the highest performance LDMOS PA IC which meets 5G requirements in 3.4\u20133.8GHz band.

All efficiency loss is due to power dissipation in the electronic circuitry used to implement the communication standard. Selection of the modulation adopted by a standards working group has a dominant role in how much of the energy efficiency available from electronic technologies and circuit structures can be made visible to the communications application. Prediction of whether a particular modulation in consideration will either allow implementers to realize high values of energy efficiency - or will force implementers to use circuit techniques which place a low ceiling on the achievable energy efficiency - is an important step that must be performed during modulation selection deliberations. Prediction of this efficiency cap, if any, is readily achieved by the calculation proposed in this mostly tutorial paper. An initial comparison of presently used signal modulations is provided.","doi":"10.23919/EuMIC.2017.8230741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMIC.2017.8230741","startPage":"392","endPage":"395","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 12th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8189162/8230630/08230741.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 12th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference (EuMIC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power amplifier efficiency ceilings due to signal modulation type","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Power amplifier efficiency ceilings due to signal modulation type","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230741/","accessionNumber":"18678961","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230741/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power amplifier efficiency ceilings due to signal modulation type","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030897S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8189162","isNumber":"8230630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8189162","xplore-issue":"8230630","articleId":"8230741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8230743,"authors":[{"name":"SungWon Chung","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, USA","University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"SungWon","lastName":"Chung","id":"37536639800"},{"name":"Rui Ma","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085358925"},{"name":"Shintaro Shinjo","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Ofuna, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Shinjo","id":"37298358300"},{"name":"Koji Yamanaka","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Ofuna, Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Yamanaka","id":"37288447300"},{"name":"Koon Hoo Teo","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Koon Hoo","lastName":"Teo","id":"37085351395"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-048-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3966-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8230743","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230743","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Radio frequency","Modulation","Radio transmitters","Delta-sigma modulation","Wideband"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital transmitter","RF filter","feedforward noise cancellation","non-contiguous inter-band carrier aggregation"]}],"abstract":"A concurrent triple-band digital transmitter architecture with relaxed RF output filter requirement is presented in this paper.

We demonstrate a feedforward noise cancellation technique in order to suppress the out-of-band quantization noise of concurrent triple-band delta-sigma modulation for the first time.

The zero-pi phase switching function is achieved by switching two input ports of a transformer in front of a differential amplifier with a single-pole dual-throw (SPDT) switch. This makes it possible to approximately halve the active circuit scale of a conventional four-phase branch phase shifter.

Circulation is achieved by exploiting the counter-rotating modes excited in an axially magnetized semiconductor rod. Theoretical analysis is carried out by considering an infinitely-long semiconductor rod magnetized along its axis. A split between the clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating modes is observed and exploited to design a circulator by placing a piece of the semiconductor rod in a three port waveguide junction. The circulator is realised using an Indium Antimoinde (InSb) rod at 77 K placed in a WR-28 waveguide junction and magnetically biased with 0.5 T. Measurements show isolation of more than 15 dB and about 2.5 dB of insertion loss at 38 GHz. Results reported in this paper indicate a potential of realising a new class of circulators that can work up to the THz frequency range, which is not possible using the classical ferrite circulators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230830/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A semiconductor based millimeter-wave waveguide junction circulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A semiconductor based millimeter-wave waveguide junction circulator","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051249S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8230830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8230838,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The SPA achieves a bandwidth of more than 1 GHz (RBW of 28%) and shows a peak drain efficiency of 47% in 8 dB backoff at 3.5 GHz. To transmit a complex signal such as QAM using the SPA, its two inputs have to be driven according to the system's characteristic curve. For the first time, modified constellation diagrams for each input have been derived to transmit a 16-QAM-modulated test signal with 10 MBaud at 3.2 GHz. For the amplification of this signal, the system shows an increase in drain efficiency of 10 %-points compared to a conventional class-B PA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Couplers","Constellation diagram","Power amplifiers","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","amplification","microwave power amplifiers","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband Sequential Power Amplifier","active MIMO antenna","active antenna","amplifier modules","stabilization networks","peak drain efficiency","complex signal","16-QAM-modulated test signal","mobile communication signal","frequency 3.5 GHz","frequency 1.0 GHz","noise figure 8.0 dB","frequency 3.2 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230855","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08230855.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sequential power amplifier at 3.5 GHz for 5G applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sequential power amplifier at 3.5 GHz for 5G applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230855/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230855/","accessionNumber":"17450054","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sequential power amplifier at 3.5 GHz for 5G applications","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051643S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8230855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8230857,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Compared with widely used conventional Chebyshev LPF matching networks, the proposed output matching network provides a good approximation of desired lumped elements over the entire frequency band. The MN offers a sharp roll-off to the transition band. Optimum fundamental and second harmonic load impedances are obtained by identifying the high efficiency regions on the reactance plane for second harmonic band placement, the design is reduced to a fundamental matching problem. A PA with this concept is designed from 1.0 to 1.5 GHz (FBW=40%) using a Cree GaN HEMT CGH40045. The peak output power, drain efficiency, and gain are 47.3 dBm, 80%, and 12.6 dB, respectively at 1.2 GHz. Furthermore, the PA is evaluated using a COFDM signal with an average output power of 40 dBm, a peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) of 10 dB, and a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz. The PA can achieve a peak drain efficiency of 49% and the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of -26.3 dBc at 1.3 and 1 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230857/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Highly efficient wideband harmonic-tuned power amplifier using low-pass matching network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly efficient wideband harmonic-tuned power amplifier using low-pass matching network","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038885S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8230857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8230868,"authors":[{"name":"Melanie Bense","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen- N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Melanie","lastName":"Bense","id":"37086276539"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen- N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8230868","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"The use of multi-user massive MIMO systems is considered as one of the key technologies for next generation communication systems such as 5G. Since the complexity of channel estimation together with the resulting occurrence of pilot contamination are one of the key problems for massive MIMO, noncoherent systems have been suggested. For these systems no actual channel knowledge is needed, but only a user-specific power-space profile (PSP), which can be determined at the massive receiver array. To further optimize these noncoherent systems we want to analyze and verify the proposed model for this PSP in detail. For this purpose two measurement scenarios have been realized. The measurement results will show real PSPs and whether so called large-scale fading, which has been observed before, has influence on it.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08230868.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"379","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel measurements for the evaluation of noncoherent massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel measurements","noncoherent massive MIMO systems","multiuser massive MIMO systems","generation communication systems","channel estimation","noncoherent systems","user-specific power-space profile","PSP","massive receiver array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Channel measurements for the evaluation of noncoherent massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230868/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450055","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel measurements for the evaluation of noncoherent massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034391S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8230868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8230888,"authors":[{"name":"Morten Olavsbr\u00e5ten","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Morten","lastName":"Olavsbr\u00e5ten","id":"37326463100"},{"name":"Dragan Gecan","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Gecan","id":"37085816354"},{"name":"Maxwell R.

The measured 2-GHz PA is a harmonically tuned 10W GaN PA with CW peak output power of 40.3dB and peak PAE of 69%. Six different drain supply trajectories are investigated with a 16-QAM 4MSym/s signal. Envelope tracking (ET) for the peak efficiency trajectory results in an average PAE=42.1%, Pout=30.0dBm, EVM=9.6% with a required tracking bandwidth of 11-24MHz. Using a power-envelope trajectory further enhances PAE by 6 percentage points, increases the output power by 1.9dB, and results in slightly better linearity, with a significantly lower drain supply modulator (DSM) bandwidth of 4.5MHz. Additionally, the strong gain variation with drain supply voltage characteristic of GaN devices is exploited to linearize the amplifier. A constant gain trajectory of 10.4dB results in average PAE=52.7%, Pout=33.7dBm, EVM=4.8% and a DSM bandwidth of 10-35MHz. The corresponding power-envelope trajectory results in the same performance, but requires only 4.5MHz DSM bandwidth.

In addition, a drain efficiency of more than 60% was obtained over a wide frequency range from 4.52 to 4.94 GHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Dual band","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Impedance","Gain","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","HEMT circuits","III-V semiconductors","microwave field effect transistors","microwave power amplifiers","transmission lines","wide band gap semiconductors","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband high-efficiency HEMT amplifier","\u03bb/4 open-ended stubs","harmonics T-shaped stubs","maximum drain efficiency","reactance control transmission lines","high-efficiency bandwidths","third-order harmonics","multiharmonic treatment technique","dual-band design","dual-band multiharmonic treatments","frequency 4.52 GHz to 4.94 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","high efficiency","dual band","harmonic treatment","GaN HEMT"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230891","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08230891.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-band high-efficiency GaN HEMT amplifier based on dual-band multi-harmonic treatments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wide-band high-efficiency GaN HEMT amplifier based on dual-band multi-harmonic treatments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230891/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8230891/","accessionNumber":"17449975","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-band high-efficiency GaN HEMT amplifier based on dual-band multi-harmonic treatments","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127147S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8230891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8230892,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Wolff","affiliation":["Ferdinand-Braun-Institut (FBH), Leibniz-Institut fuer Hoechstfrequenztechnik, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Nikolai","lastName":"Wolff","id":"37085426397"},{"name":"Wolfgang Heinrich","affiliation":["Ferdinand-Braun-Institut (FBH), Leibniz-Institut fuer Hoechstfrequenztechnik, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Heinrich","id":"37266762000"},{"name":"Olof Bengtsson","affiliation":["Ferdinand-Braun-Institut (FBH), Leibniz-Institut fuer Hoechstfrequenztechnik, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Olof","lastName":"Bengtsson","id":"37325866600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8230892","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Switching frequency","Switches","Peak to average power ratio","Frequency modulation","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulators","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum efficiency enhancement","continuous envelope tracking systems","modulation bandwidth","supply voltage levels","modulator switching frequencies","discrete level","supply modulated systems","bandwidth trade-off","efficiency trade-off enhancement","class-G supply-modulated power amplifiers","digital predistortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["supply modulation","class-G","envelope tracking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8230892","abstract":"This work deals with class-G, i.e. discrete level, supply modulated systems. It is investigated how the efficiency improvement achievable through this approach depends on the maximum switching frequency of the modulator. As could be expected for high modulation bandwidths a fast class-G modulator is desirable in order to achieve maximum efficiency enhancement. However, for class-G, contrary to continuous envelope tracking systems, it is possible to operate the modulator at switching frequencies far below the modulation bandwidth and still achieve a significant efficiency enhancement. The results show that, for systems with two supply voltage levels, no further significant improvement in efficiency is obtained with modulator switching frequencies higher than 85% of the modulation bandwidth. For lower frequencies the efficiency decreases almost linearly. Furthermore, by increasing the amount of supply voltage levels from two to four at constant switching speed it is found that the bandwidth at constant efficiency can be increased by a factor of 3.4. In combination with digital predistortion no significant influence of the switching frequency on linearity is observed.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8230892","startPage":"472","endPage":"475","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08230892.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The efficiency/bandwidth trade-off in class-G supply-modulated power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"The efficiency/bandwidth trade-off in class-G supply-modulated power amplifiers","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8230892/","accessionNumber":"17450100","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8230892/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The efficiency/bandwidth trade-off in class-G supply-modulated power amplifiers","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071106S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8230892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8230913,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Qi","affiliation":["University of of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Cheng Du, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085708624"},{"name":"SongBai He","affiliation":["University of of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Cheng Du, China"],"firstName":"SongBai","lastName":"He","id":"37279982200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8230913","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"abstract":"A novel method to design Doherty power amplifier (DPA) with promoted high efficiency performance in a very large output power back-off (OBO) is proposed in this paper.

The contribution at hand deals with multi-antenna backscatter measurements with up to two scatter antennas and two receive antennas, in order to investigate the backscatter channel and the data transmission within a multipath environment at 5.8 GHz.

Unfortunately, high levels of in-band distortion introduced by fully digitally implemented PWM, limit its usage in transceivers realized for software defined radio. In this paper, we exploit time-domain characterization of digital PWM in-band distortion, and propose a multilevel power encoding scheme based on DSM-PWM hybrid architecture with carefully selected design parameters, which enable optimal in-band distortion cancellation with low hardware complexity. Experiments with an arbitrary waveform generator are used to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed novel power encoding scheme, and are compared with a standard multilevel PWM.

It could extend the driving distance of E-cars by reducing the weight of bulky cables. It can also bring more sensing functions, turning the car into smart units for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Until now, most works of IVWSNs channel characterization are focused on in-car wireless communication. This paper presents for the first time, to author's knowledge, the channel characterization of a non-line-of-sight damper-to-damper wireless communication at 2.4 GHz frequency band, including the signal reflection from ground. A method of 3D EM simulation is provided. Static and dynamic on-field car measurement is also performed on a commercial car with different road profiles. It shows that different road profiles equally impact path loss specification because of similar permittivity. From on-field measurements, it proves that 5.25 MHz frequency isolation leads to uncorrelated channels.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8231100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8231100","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1344","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08231100.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damper-to-damper path loss characterization for Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Damper-to-damper path loss characterization for Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8231100/","accessionNumber":"17450047","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231100/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damper-to-damper path loss characterization for Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044742S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8231100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8231102,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Mahler","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics (IHE), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Mahler","id":"38125028600"},{"name":"Thibault Deletoille","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics (IHE), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thibault","lastName":"Deletoille","id":"37086290156"},{"name":"Johannes Frey","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics (IHE), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Frey","id":"37086292959"},{"name":"Jerzy Kowalewski","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics (IHE), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Kowalewski","id":"38504330400"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Radio Frequency Engineering and Electronics (IHE), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37273510500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8231102","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","channel capacity","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna array geometry","antenna element radiation patterns","antenna synthesis method","simulated channels","ergodic channel capacity","transmission channel","MIMO channel model","simple channel model","propagation paths","antenna synthesis problem","multiple input multiple output channel samples"]}],"abstract":"In this paper multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel samples are generated by the use of a simple channel model that allows for arbitrary selection of the propagation paths. The distributions of direction of departure (DOD), direction of arrival (DOA) and phases and amplitudes can be selected for each path. The antenna array geometry and the antenna element radiation patterns are also included and can be chosen arbitrarily. An antenna synthesis method that is based on eigenbeamforming is then applied to the simulated channels. It is the optimal solution of the considered antenna synthesis problem that maximizes ergodic channel capacity. The resulting fixed synthesized antenna radiation patterns are evaluated in terms of their matching effect to the predominant directions of the transmission channel afterwards. The results show that the channel model is beneficial for the development of antenna synthesis methods. It includes all parameters necessary for the design and evaluation of antenna synthesis methods and still has a low complexity.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8231102","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08231102.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8231102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying antenna synthesis methods on a path based MIMO channel model for verification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applying antenna synthesis methods on a path based MIMO channel model for verification","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231102/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450036","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8231102/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying antenna synthesis methods on a path based MIMO channel model for verification","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"0054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048924S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170162","isNumber":"8230749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8230749","articleId":"8231102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8231108,"authors":[{"name":"Gwena\u00ebl Reineix","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, University of Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Gwena\u00ebl","lastName":"Reineix","id":"37086299611"},{"name":"Romain N\u00e9grier","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, University of Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"N\u00e9grier","id":"37085436814"},{"name":"Mich\u00e8le Lalande","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, University of Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Mich\u00e8le","lastName":"Lalande","id":"37301028600"},{"name":"Vincent Couderc","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, University of Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Couderc","id":"37267900100"},{"name":"Jo\u00ebl Andrieu","affiliation":["XLIM Laboratory, University of Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Jo\u00ebl","lastName":"Andrieu","id":"37272977900"},{"name":"Laurent Desrumaux","affiliation":["DGA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Desrumaux","id":"37400681600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-047-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8231108","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231108","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Microstrip","Transient analysis","Voltage measurement","Optical pulses","Optical pulse generation","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","integrated optoelectronics","photoconducting switches","ultra wideband antennas","waveform generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Agilent advance design system","photoconductive semiconductor switch","optoelectronic ultrawideband transient waveforms generation","PCSS response","high-voltage pulses","optoelectronic bench","specific spectral conditions","arbitrary transient waveforms","optimization modeling","genetic algorithm development","PCSS characterization","wavelength 1064.0 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Waveform Generation","Photoconductive Silicon Switch","Algorithm design and analysis"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2017.8231108","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170162/8230749/08231108.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 47th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8230749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2017.8231108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optoelectronic waveforms generation: PCSS characterization and genetic algorithm","abstract":"This paper proposes a contribution to optoelectronic ultra-wideband transient waveforms generation.

We first analyze the leakage-based precoder design under a full multiplexing constraint, which maximizes the signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) for each individual user. We prove that the SLNR-optimal multistream precoder always maximizes the SLNR via essentially concentrating all the available transmit power on a single data stream, regardless of the rank constraint. We then propose a novel design criterion, called signal-over-leakage capacity (SLC), which corresponds to the achievable rate difference between a virtual signal-only link and a virtual interference-only link, for each individual user. We completely solve the SLC maximization problem and provide a closed-form optimal solution, which distributes the transmit power among multiple data streams, and thus better utilizes the available spatial degrees of freedom in an MU-MIMO system. Numerical experimental results are provided to corroborate the analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Multi-User MIMO Precoding Design Via Signal-Over-Leakage Capacity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785347","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08231123.pdf","startPage":"2812","endPage":"2824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Multi-User MIMO Precoding Design Via Signal-Over-Leakage Capacity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8231123/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542755","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61631017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Downlink Multi-User MIMO Precoding Design Via Signal-Over-Leakage Capacity","sourcePdf":"access-shen-2785347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091511S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8231123","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8231126,"authors":[{"name":"Jiguang Lv","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8231126/lv-2785444-small.gif","p":["Jiguang Lv received the M.E. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

With the rapid development of wireless communication, device-free passive human detection based on wireless techniques may have more opportunities in intrusion detection. WiFi has been widely deployed in both public and private areas, which can be used as generalized sensors to detect human motion beyond communication. As a result, there have been several researches on WLAN-based motion detection. However, the detection accuracy of previous approaches declines significantly when people\u2019s moving speed becomes very slow. In this paper, we explore a novel method which has a relative stable detection performance under different moving speeds. We extract a novel feature representing the fluctuation of the whole channel from channel state information at the physical layer of 802.11n wireless networks, and utilize a probability technique to detect human motion. A hidden Markov model is leveraged as the classifier to make human detection a probability problem. We implement the system using off-the-shelf WiFi devices and evaluate it in two scenarios. As indicated in the evaluation results, our approach is an appropriate method for intrusion detection.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08231126.pdf","startPage":"30117","endPage":"30127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust WLAN-Based Indoor Intrusion Detection Using PHY Layer Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust WLAN-Based Indoor Intrusion Detection Using PHY Layer Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8231126/","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17829602","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61300206, 61472098 and 6177010612"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust WLAN-Based Indoor Intrusion Detection Using PHY Layer Information","sourcePdf":"access-man-2785444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097906S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8231126","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":8231134,"authors":[{"name":"John F.

Nanophotodetectors offer the opportunity to overcome this problem by allowing us to realize an amplifier-free bias-free receiver. Low device capacitance and forward-biased operation are the keys to achieving such a receiver, which can operate with signal light alone, namely without extra electrical energy. A photonic-crystal waveguide combined with an embedded absorber is a good candidate for this purpose, since our simulation reveals that light confinement and carrier depletion in a narrow dimension lead to fast and efficient operation. We also carry out circuit analyses to investigate the receiver performance and compare it with that of a conventional receiver with amplifiers. We show that an amplifier-free bias-free receiver can be expected to offer advantages in terms of energy consumption, signal-to-noise ratio, footprint, and delay.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2777105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/7985003/08231139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2017.2777105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7985003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplifier-Free Bias-Free Receiver Based on Low-Capacitance Nanophotodetector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231139/","displayDocTitle":"Amplifier-Free Bias-Free Receiver Based on Low-Capacitance Nanophotodetector","volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2018","accessionNumber":"17424478","externalId":"4900111","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8231139/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Corporation","grantNumber":"JPMJCR15N4"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplifier-Free Bias-Free Receiver Based on Low-Capacitance Nanophotodetector","sourcePdf":"jstqe-nozaki-2777105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053442S","chronDate":"March-April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"7985003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7985003","articleId":"8231139","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8231144,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086027126"},{"name":"Jia Liu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086021193"},{"name":"Zhe Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Orthopaedics, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086401344"},{"name":"Mingyu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086433469"},{"name":"Hongen Liao","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongen","lastName":"Liao","id":"37274929700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"8231144","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":760},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Computed tomography","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bone","computerised tomography","edge detection","feature extraction","image enhancement","image fusion","image segmentation","medical image processing","orthopaedics","shape recognition","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic femur segmentation","computed tomography volume","computer-aided diagnosis","weak bone boundaries","femur density","diverse leg postures","feature enhancement modules","edge detection task","multiscale features fusion","weak femur boundary","task-specific edge detector","femur shape","three dimensional feature-enhanced network","orthopedic surgeries","Dice similarity coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks","deep learning","femur segmentation","feature enhancement"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Deep Learning","Femur","Humans","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"abstract":"Automatic femur segmentation from computed tomography volume is a crucial but challenging task for computer-aided diagnosis in orthopedic surgeries. The main obstacles are weak bone boundaries, narrowness of joint space, variations in femur density and shape, as well as diverse leg postures. In this paper, we presented a novel 3-D feature-enhanced network to address these challenges. The novelty of our approach lies in two feature enhancement modules, including the edge detection task and the multi-scale features fusion. First, the edge detection task was embedded into femur segmentation from computed tomography volume to solve the problems of narrow joint space and weak femur boundary. Crucially, a task-specific edge detector was used to optimize the performance of femur segmentation in an end-to-end trainable system. Second, the multi-scale features fusion provided both local and global contexts to handle the problems of large variations in leg postures as well as femur shape and density. The results demonstrated that accurate 3-D femur segmentation with a high Dice similarity coefficient of 96.88% was achieved using the developed method, and the segmentation of computed tomography volume took 0.93 s on an average.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Feature-Enhanced Network for Automatic Femur Segmentation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2017.2785389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8602373/08231144.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2785389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8602373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Feature-Enhanced Network for Automatic Femur Segmentation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8231144/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2019","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18360119","pubMedId":"29990051","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFC0108000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81427803 and 81771940"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009592","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"Z151100003915079"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"7172122"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Feature-Enhanced Network for Automatic Femur Segmentation","sourcePdf":"jbhi-liao-2785389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105659S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8602373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8602373","articleId":"8231144","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8231146,"authors":[{"name":"Shengbin Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shengbin","lastName":"Cao","orcid":"0000-0003-1747-3747","id":"37085857520"},{"name":"Victor C.

In the move toward these 100 Gb/s to 1 Tb/s class PONs, research into the latest coherent technology based PON systems is being pursued due to its high receiver sensitivity at much higher bit rates, superior to current direct-detection based PON systems, aided by the rapid progress of the latest small-scale digital signal processing (DSP) suitable for access spans of less than a few tens of km. In this paper, we review the recent progress of such 100 Gb/s to 1 Tb/s class coherent PON technology. As the key successful factor for realizing 100 Gb/s to 1 Tb/s based coherent PON systems, the latest trends in coherent DSP and the accompanying embedded coherent transceivers are summarized from the point of view of miniaturization. In addition, highlighting the strong progress with the upcoming coherent PON systems, the first demonstration of a 100 Gb/s/\u03bb \u00d7 8 wavelengths (800 Gb/s) based real-time wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-PON system using a simplified DSP suitable for access spans is presented. A 100 Gb/s/\u03bb based time division multiplexing (TDM)-PON system is also introduced, addressing the burst-mode coherent reception technique which will be the main issue for achieving practical TDM-based coherent PON systems.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2785341","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8299503/08231150.pdf","startPage":"1485","endPage":"1491","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2785341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"100 Gb/s to 1 Tb/s Based Coherent Passive Optical Network Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"100 Gb/s to 1 Tb/s Based Coherent Passive Optical Network Technology","volume":"36","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17596297","publicationDate":"15 April15, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8231150/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"100 Gb/s to 1 Tb/s Based Coherent Passive Optical Network Technology","sourcePdf":"jlt-suzuki-2785341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080475S","chronDate":"April15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8299503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8299503","articleId":"8231150","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8231164,"authors":[{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8231164/yang-2785415-small.gif","p":["Chenguang Yang (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.Eng.\n degree in measurement and control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2005, and the\n Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2010.","He was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Imperial College London, London, U.K. His research interests include\n robotics, automation, and computational intelligence.","Dr. Yang is a recipient of the Best Paper Awards from the IEEE Transactions on Robotics and a number of\n international conferences."]},"firstName":"Chenguang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-5255-5559","id":"37404783000"},{"name":"Huaiwei Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8231164/wu-2785415-small.gif","p":["Huaiwei Wu received the B.E. degree in automation from South China\n University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2015, and is currently working toward the M.S. degree at the South\n China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.","His research interests include signal processing and robotics control."]},"firstName":"Huaiwei","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0003-2224-7963","id":"37085840827"},{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8231164/li-2785415-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Li (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree in\n mechatronics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent\n systems, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.

Through the analysis of the invoked EEG signals, a brain-computer interface is developed to infer the exact object that is required by the user. These results are then transferred to the shared control system, which is enabled by visual servoing techniques to achieve accurate object manipulation. The task motion and self-motion (CTS) methods are coordinated to enhance the intelligence of the shared control system by equipping the robot with an autonomous obstacle avoidance function. Extensive experimental studies are performed to verify that the adaptive object tracking algorithm, the CTS method, and the least-squares method are helpful in improving the performance of the intelligent robotic system.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2785415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8454923/08231164.pdf","startPage":"3822","endPage":"3830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2785415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8454923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mind Control of a Robotic Arm With Visual Fusion Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Mind Control of a Robotic Arm With Visual Fusion Technology","volume":"14","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"05 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18059439","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8231164/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231164/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61473120"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030313266"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Collaboration","grantNumber":"2015A050502017"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201607010006"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System (HIT)","grantNumber":"SKLRS-2017-KF-13"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2017ZD057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mind Control of a Robotic Arm With Visual Fusion Technology","sourcePdf":"tii-yang-2785415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080357S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8454923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8454923","articleId":"8231164","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":8231167,"authors":[{"name":"Guoxing Wen","affiliation":["College of Science, Binzhou University, Binzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8231167/weng-2782229-small.gif","p":["Guoxing Wen received the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from the\n Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in computer and information science\n from Macau University, Macau, China, in 2014.","He was a Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering,\n National University of Singapore, Singapore, from September 2015 to September 2016.

In this brief, we propose a highly efficient architecture for point multiplication on Koblitz curves. The right-to-left point multiplication algorithm is adopted to allow parallel computation of Frobenius maps and point additions. In order to achieve short latency as well as high frequency, we explore operation rescheduling in consecutive point additions with a pipelined bitparallel finite field multiplier accumulator. Furthermore, the pipelined mixed-form double-digit scalar converter with compact recoding is employed to reduce the wait time and consumed logic resources by scalar conversion. Fast inversion based on optimal addition chains is used to further reduce the latency. Implementation results on Xilinx Virtex V show that the proposed architecture can perform a point multiplication in as few as 2.50, 4.09, 5.81, 9.50, 18.51 \u03bcs over the five NIST Koblitz curves K-163, K-233, K-283, K-409, and K-571, respectively.

To alleviate the difficulty, this paper presents a multitasking evolutionary optimization framework for solving computationally expensive problems. In the framework, knowledge is transferred from a number of computationally cheap optimization problems to help the solution of the expensive problem on the basis of the recently proposed multifactorial EA (MFEA), leading to a faster convergence of the expensive problem. However, existing MFEAs do not work well in solving multitasking problems whose optimums do not lie in the same location or when the dimensions of the decision space are not the same. To address the above issues, the existing MFEA is generalized by proposing two strategies, one for decision variable translation and the other for decision variable shuffling, to facilitate knowledge transfer between optimization problems having different locations of the optimums and different numbers of decision variables. To assess the effectiveness of the generalized MFEA (G-MFEA), empirical studies have been conducted on eight multitasking instances and eight test problems for expensive optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed G-MFEA works more efficiently for multitasking optimization and successfully accelerates the convergence of expensive optimization problems compared to single-task optimization.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2017.2785351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8628278/08231172.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2017.2785351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Multitasking for Evolutionary Optimization of Expensive Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Multitasking for Evolutionary Optimization of Expensive Problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231172/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18414582","htmlLink":"/document/8231172/","volume":"23","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61525302, 61590922 and 61621004"},{"fundingName":"Projects of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"2014020021 and LR2015021"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N160801001 and N161608001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Multitasking for Evolutionary Optimization of Expensive Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-jin-2785351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132998S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8628278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8628278","articleId":"8231172","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8231174,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Xin Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8412378/8231174/guan-2784821-small.gif","p":["Qing-Xin Guan (S\u201917) was born in Jilin Province, China.

In order to realize a high-power-density design for three-level converters, SiC MOSFETs may be selected instead of using Si insulated-gate bipolar transistors. However, all-SiC-MOSFET-based converters suffer from extremely high total cost. In this paper, a SiC MOSFET and Si device hybrid active neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter is proposed. It consists of four Si active switches and only two SiC MOSFETs. Thus, it has lower total cost compared to the all-SiC-MOSFET-based ANPC converter. Furthermore, a dedicated modulation scheme is proposed to completely move all the switching events from Si devices to SiC MOSFETs by using redundant switching states. As a result, the switching losses are significantly reduced and extremely high efficiency is achieved. The proposed converter has fully utilized the low-switching-loss advantage of SiC MOSFETs and the low-cost advantage of Si devices, which shows significant superiority in high-end grid-connected inverter and rectifier applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8412378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2784821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8412378/08231174.pdf","startPage":"8341","endPage":"8352","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2784821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Extremely High Efficient Three-Level Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter Comprising SiC and Si Hybrid Power Stages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"An Extremely High Efficient Three-Level Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter Comprising SiC and Si Hybrid Power Stages","volume":"33","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8231174/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"17935427","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundations of China","grantNumber":"51490682 and 51677166"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"LR16E070001"},{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extremely High Efficient Three-Level Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter Comprising SiC and Si Hybrid Power Stages","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2784821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07739S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8412378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"8412378","articleId":"8231174","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8231193,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongke Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Efficient Utilization of Low and Medium Grade Energy (Tianjin University), Ministry of Education, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8231193/gao-2785384-small.gif","p":["Zhongke Gao received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees at the School of\n Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","He has been a Full Professor with the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, since\n 2016.

Moreover, by using the center-free algorithm and the projection method, the traditional centralized ADMM is extended to the distributed implementation framework, and a fully distributed solution to the EDP is obtained. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can deal with both equality and inequality constraints in the EDP, and the supply-demand balance can be guaranteed at any time provided that the sum of initial power outputs is equal to the total demand. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm is strictly proved.

A simple control algorithm is implemented by using Grassmann's law of color mixing and McCamy's formula of CCT. Light from a white LED source is blended with that from a blue LED or a red LED to get, respectively, a CCT value higher or lower than that of the white CCT. The prototype LED lighting system can independently produce a variable CCT ranging from 2500 to 12500 K and a variable illuminance ranging from 5 to 120 lx. The algorithm is experimentally validated by hardware implementation. An empirical model to estimate the luminous parameters of the individual LED is also implemented. Experimental results show that although the system is an open-loop one, it is quite accurate with respect to set point CCT and illuminance.

SN P systems performed well in describing and modeling behaviors that occur simultaneously, yet weak at modeling complex systems with the limits of using a single spike. In this paper, drawing on the idea from colored petri nets, SN P systems with colored spikes are proposed, where a finite set of colors is introduced to mark the spikes such that each spike is associated with a unique color. The updated spiking rule is applied by consuming and emitting a number of colored spikes (with the same or different colors). The computation power of the systems is investigated. Specifically, it is shown that SN P systems with colored spikes having three neurons are sufficient to compute Turing computable sets of numbers, and such system having two neurons is able to compute the family of recursive functions. These results improved the corresponding ones on the number of neurons needed to construct universal SN P systems recently appeared in [Neurocomputing, 2016, 193(12): 193-200]. To our best knowledge, this is the smallest number of neurons used to construct Turing universal SN P systems as number generator and function computing device by far.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18292787","htmlLink":"/document/8231210/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spiking Neural P Systems With Colored Spikes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402187, 61502535, 61572522, 61572523, 61672033, 61472333, 61772441 and 61672248"},{"fundingName":"Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"2017GGX10147"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"16CX02006A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking Neural P Systems With Colored Spikes","sourcePdf":"tcds-zeng-2785332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.237947S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7274989","isNumber":"8567843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274989","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8567843","articleId":"8231210","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8231212,"authors":[{"name":"Vineet Vajpayee","affiliation":["Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Vineet","lastName":"Vajpayee","orcid":"0000-0003-1179-7118","id":"37073126400"},{"name":"Siddhartha Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Seismology Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India","Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278558000"},{"name":"Akhilanand Pati Tiwari","affiliation":["Reactor Control System Design Section, Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai, India","Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Akhilanand Pati","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"37347506000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"8231212","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231212","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Inductors","Predictive control","Discrete wavelet transforms","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","feedforward","fission reactor core control","predictive control","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pressurized water nuclear reactor","load-following transients","load rejection","control parameters","integral control action","feedforward control","explicit process model","subspace predictive reactor core power control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load-following operation","nuclear reactor","predictive control","pressurized water-type reactor (PWR)","subspace identification","wavelet filtering"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a methodology of designing subspace predictive reactor core power control during load-following mode of operation.

Furthermore, time variations in the process are taken into account by recursively updating control parameters with the arrival of new data set.

With the genetic algorithm incorporated with the linear-programming, key design of the 5-T LTS EMPS magnet is introduced and followed by the detailed magnet specifications including field uniformity at 50-mm space, magnetic hoop stress, critical current margin, and dimensions. The linear-programming restricts the magnet space and structure to minimize the total volume of the wires. Meanwhile, the genetic algorithm calculates the layers, turns, and detailed dimensions of the magnet in the magnet space confined by the linear-programming. Furthermore, quench analysis on multicoils employing finite difference equations in liquid helium was carried out to verify the thermal stability of the LTS magnet. The quench simulation code calculates temperature profiles of the magnet considering heat transfer among the unit cells and joule heat of the magnet in three-dimensional space. The LTS magnet for 5-T EMPS will be fabricated according to the design results.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2017.2785390","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2017.2785390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8114526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel7/77/8114526/08231217.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Design and Multicoils Quench Analysis of the EMPS Superconducting Magnet Employing Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231217/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Design and Multicoils Quench Analysis of the EMPS Superconducting Magnet Employing Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","volume":"28","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8231217/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17460347","externalId":"4900605","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003716","fundingName":"Korea Basic Science Institute","grantNumber":"D37614"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003716","fundingName":"Korea Basic Science Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Design and Multicoils Quench Analysis of the EMPS Superconducting Magnet Employing Hybrid Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tasc-jang-2785390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081315S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"8114526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8114526","articleId":"8231217","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8231220,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Xiao","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8231220/xiao-2785414-small.gif","p":["Liang Xiao (M\u201909\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S. degree in\n communication engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2000, the\n M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, in 2009.

In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes.

This is due to its shared characteristics of simplicity and ease of manual tuning while allowing for mismatches and improved performance even in the presence of stochastic delay. However, in order to avoid excessive overshoots and oscillations due to the stochastic delay, the parameters of this controller need to be tuned. Therefore, this paper presents the use of simple but efficient nature inspired spiral dynamic algorithm (SDA) to tune the parameters of the PPI controller designed for WHNCS. Simulation results showed that the SDA-tuned PPI controller outperformed the compared PPI and PID controllers in terms of overshoot, disturbance rejection and smooth control signals for both first and second order plants considered. Furthermore, the proposed controller settles faster than the other controllers both before and after disturbance. Hence, the SDA-tuned PPI controller has the potential of improving systems control performance.","doi":"10.1109/ROMA.2017.8231729","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171403/8231728/08231729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Symposium in Robotics and Manufacturing Automation (ROMA)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Symposium in Robotics and Manufacturing Automation (ROMA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMA.2017.8231729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiral dynamic algorithm based optimal PPI controller for WirelessHART networked systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spiral dynamic algorithm based optimal PPI controller for WirelessHART networked systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17451143","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8231729/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiral dynamic algorithm based optimal PPI controller for WirelessHART networked systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053308S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171403","isNumber":"8231728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171403","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8231728","articleId":"8231729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8231848,"authors":[{"name":"Julian A.

The process of generating actionable insights, called data exploration, is a difficult and time-consuming task. Data exploration of a big dataset usually requires first generating a small and representative data sample that can be easily plotted and viewed, managed and interpreted to generate insights. However, the literature on the topic hints at data scientists only using random sampling with regular sized datasets and it is unclear what they do with Big Data. In this work, we first show evidence from a survey that random sampling is the only technique commonly used by data scientists to quickly gain insights from a big dataset despite theoretical and empirical evidence from the active learning community that suggests benefits of using other sampling techniques. Second, to evaluate and demonstrate the benefits of other sampling techniques, we conducted an online study with 34 data scientists. These scientists performed a data exploration task to support a classification goal using data samples from more than 2 million records of editing data from Wikipedia articles, generated using different sampling techniques. The study results demonstrate that sampling techniques other than random sampling can generate insights that help to focus on different characteristics of the data, without compromising quality in a data exploration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8231848/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451167","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling techniques to improve big data exploration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling techniques to improve big data exploration","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"026035rojas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060554S","chronDate":"2-2 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171405","isNumber":"8231842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171405","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8231842","articleId":"8231848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8231852,"authors":[{"name":"Nick Leaf","affiliation":["University of California"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Leaf","id":"38667320300"},{"name":"Bob Miller","affiliation":["University of California Davis, Davis, CA, US"],"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Miller"},{"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","affiliation":["University of California"],"firstName":"Kwan-Liu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37275869400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0617-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0618-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8231852","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Hardware","Pipelines","Graphics processing units","Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","encoding","floating point arithmetic","graphics processing units","rendering (computer graphics)","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point volume data","special-purpose hardware","scientific simulations","computed timesteps","bandwidth limitations","compressibility","computational complexity","achievable compression ratio","special-purpose video encoding","super computers","lossy encoding","general-purpose computation","encoded volumes","decompressed volumes","rendering","GPU-equipped super computers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Volume compression","floating-point compression","GPU video encoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231852","doi":"10.1109/LDAV.2017.8231852","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)","abstract":"Scientific simulations typically store only a small fraction of computed timesteps due to storage and I/O bandwidth limitations. Previous work has demonstrated the compressibility of floating-point volume data, but such compression often comes with a tradeoff between computational complexity and the achievable compression ratio. This work demonstrates the use of special-purpose video encoding hardware on the GPU which is present but (to the best of our knowledge) completely unused in current GPU-equipped super computers such as Titan. We show that lossy encoding allows the output of far more data at sufficient quality for a posteriori rendering and analysis. We also show that the encoding can be computed in parallel to general-purpose computation due to the special-purpose hardware. Finally, we demonstrate such encoded volumes are inexpensive to decode in memory during analysis, making it unnecessary to ever store the decompressed volumes on disk.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LDAV.2017.8231852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231842","startPage":"64","endPage":"73","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171405/8231842/08231852.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In situ video encoding of floating-point volume data using special-purpose hardware for a posteriori rendering and analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8231852/","displayDocTitle":"In situ video encoding of floating-point volume data using special-purpose hardware for a posteriori rendering and analysis","conferenceDate":"2-2 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451159","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In situ video encoding of floating-point volume data using special-purpose hardware for a posteriori rendering and analysis","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"064073leaf.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090597S","chronDate":"2-2 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171405","isNumber":"8231842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171405","xplore-issue":"8231842","articleId":"8231852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8231853,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Arleo","affiliation":["University of Perugia"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Arleo","id":"37086329678"},{"name":"Oh-Hyun Kwon","affiliation":["University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Oh-Hyun","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37085484504"},{"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","affiliation":["University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Kwan-Liu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37275869400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0617-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0618-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8231853","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231853","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Distributed algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Time complexity","Visualization","Electronic mail","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","graph theory","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed pathfinder network scaling","graph sparsification technique","PFNET","prohibitively expensive time complexity","distributed technique","graph structure","GraphRay","parallel distributed computing environment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LDAV.2017.8231853","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 7th Symposium on Large Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171405/8231842/08231853.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LDAV.2017.8231853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GraphRay: Distributed pathfinder network scaling","abstract":"Pathfinder network scaling is a graph sparsification technique that has been popularly used due to its efficacy of extracting the \u201cimportant\u201d structure of a graph.

Surface corona inception, stable streamer formation and flashover occur at significantly lower voltages than those obtained in the case of air alone. Surface temperature starts to increase above the ambient value when the stable streamer discharge is formed. During the stable streamer regime the insulating surface temperature is closely related to the streamer current.

However, load model parameters are significantly affected by loading conditions and change considerably due to the time-varying and weather-dependent composition of load. Therefore, load model parameters obtained from in-situ measurements are valid only for a narrow range of operating conditions. Scope of this paper is to propose a systematic identification procedure to develop generic dynamic load models, valid for a wide range of discrete operating conditions. For this purpose, two different generic modeling approaches are considered. The first approach is based on statistical analysis, while the second employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Several simulation scenarios are performed using the NEPLAN software to investigate the accuracy of the derived models over a wide range of different loading conditions, while their generalization capabilities are evaluated using the cross-validation technique.","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231937","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171422/8231858/08231937.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic dynamic load models using artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Reactive power","Mathematical model","Power system dynamics","Computational modeling","Power system stability","Load management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","power engineering computing","power system dynamic stability","power system measurement","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generic dynamic load models","artificial neural networks","phasor measurement units","load model parameters","in-situ measurements","discrete operating conditions","power systems","loading conditions","generic modeling approach","NEPLAN software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks","dynamic load modeling","exponential recovery load model","statistical analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Generic dynamic load models using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8231937/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451176","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic dynamic load models using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Heraklion, Greece","sourcePdf":"276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081947S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171422","isNumber":"8231858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171422","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8231858","articleId":"8231937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8231980,"authors":[{"name":"Basem Alamri","affiliation":["Taif University (TU), Taif, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Basem","lastName":"Alamri","id":"37085583507"},{"name":"Christos Marouchos","affiliation":["Cyprus University of Technology, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Marouchos","id":"37680765000"},{"name":"Mohamed Darwish","affiliation":["CEDPS, Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Darwish","id":"38181505900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2344-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2345-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8231980","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power filters","Reactive power","Costs","Harmonic analysis","Active filters","Information filters","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","genetic algorithms","harmonics suppression","invertors","passive filters","power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5-level CHB-MLI","genetic algorithm","power utilities","harmonic filtering","harmonic-mitigation techniques","active power filters","passive power filter design","combinatorial optimisation problem","power system","optimum PPF design","composite PPF","optimum filter design","5-level cascaded H-bridge multilevel invert"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter (CHB-MLI)","Passive Power Filters (PPF)","Genetic Algorithm (GA)","Harmonics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8231980","abstract":"While harmonics have adverse effects on both power utilities and customers, harmonic filtering is considered the most widely applied method among different harmonic-mitigation techniques. Passive power filters (PPFs) are currently more economical and commonly applied than active power filters (APFs). The problem of passive power filter (PPF) design is considered to be a combinatorial optimisation problem that can be solved by applying artificial intelligence. For PPF design, heuristic methods are powerful optimisation techniques and have many advantages such as: no requirement for detailed information about the power system and ability to achieve optimum PPF design compared to the conventional method. In addition, the cost of PPF implementation can be added to the optimisation objective, which is not considered in conventional design. The Authors of this paper propose an optimisation model based on genetic algorithm (GA) to design a composite PPF. As a case study, the model is applied to find the optimum filter design at the output of 5-level cascaded H-bridge multilevel invert (CHB-MLI).

In such cases distribution network (DN) operation will be affected. Consequently, there have been serious concerns over reliability and satisfactory operation of these power systems which contain distributed generation (DG) equipment. Distributed power generated from renewable sources is variable particularly in the case of wind generation or solar energy. The variability affects the stability of the system between supply and consumers. In DN, the losses and voltage drop across the network are significant matters and the DG location has a critical impact on the network operation. So, there is a clear need to optimise the DG size and location in the DN; for example, optimising the number of DG's and co-ordinating their operation can improve voltage drop and network losses. In this paper, an optimisation technique based on the genetic algorithm (GA) in conjunction with the power flow (PF) method is used to improve the DN performance and to identify the best location and size of the DG's. The main goal of the optimisation function is to reduce both the network losses and regulate the voltage level under different loading conditions.","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231996","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171422/8231858/08231996.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of optimal site and capacity of DG systems in distribution network based on genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Wind turbines","Optimization","Distributed power generation","Power system stability","Substations","Springs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","distribution networks","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal site","DG systems","genetic algorithm","global climate","distributed generation","intermittent sources","low voltage networks","power systems","generation equipment","distributed power","renewable sources","wind generation","solar energy","voltage drop","DG location","network losses","power flow method","DN performance","voltage level","distribution network operation","optimal capacity","PF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Generation (DG)","Distribution systems","optimal DG allocation and Genetic Algorithms (GA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8231996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Determination of optimal site and capacity of DG systems in distribution network based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8231996/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451277","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of optimal site and capacity of DG systems in distribution network based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Heraklion, Greece","sourcePdf":"368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070681S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171422","isNumber":"8231858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171422","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8231858","articleId":"8231996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8232005,"authors":[{"name":"S J Royston","affiliation":["Sheffield University, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"S J","lastName":"Royston","id":"37086322842"},{"name":"D Strickland","affiliation":["Sheffield University, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"D","lastName":"Strickland","id":"38241508400"},{"name":"D A Stone","affiliation":["Sheffield University, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"D A","lastName":"Stone","id":"37267759300"},{"name":"D T Gladwin","affiliation":["Sheffield University, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"D T","lastName":"Gladwin","id":"37938789300"},{"name":"M P Foster","affiliation":["Sheffield University, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"M P","lastName":"Foster","id":"37267753500"},{"name":"S Nejad","affiliation":["Sheffield University, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Nejad","id":"37085563871"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2344-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2345-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232005","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Arc discharges","Resistance","Inverters","Short-circuit currents","Fault currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arcs (electric)","energy storage","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity grid network","overriding standard","DC system","Willenhall Energy Storage System","arc-flash calculation comparison","energy storage systems","DC arc-flash calculations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arc-Flash","Batteries","DC Systems","Energy Storage","Power system protection","Power distribution faults","PPE","Short-circuit currents"]}],"abstract":"There is an increasing prevalence of energy storage systems on the electricity grid network.

The terminal voltage of any Li-ion battery rapidly increases at the end of the discharging, and gradually converges to the internal voltage. The internal impedance of the battery can be obtained from the transient characteristics. The internal impedance has a close relationship with deterioration of the battery. The developed circuit diagnoses the deterioration using the frequency characteristics of the internal impedance. The internal impedance is obtained from the frequency responses converted from the transient waveforms in a time domain by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The developed circuit allows a quick deterioration diagnosis during operation only by measuring the battery voltage and current. The developed circuit is achieved using common devices and estimates the lifetime of the battery without using expensive measuring equipment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a circuit for a deterioration diagnosis of Li-Ion battery using FFT by FPGA","publicationTitle":"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","doi":"10.1109/UPEC.2017.8232031","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171422/8231858/08232031.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2017.8232031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8231858","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Development of a circuit for a deterioration diagnosis of Li-Ion battery using FFT by FPGA","conferenceDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8232031/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451177","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a circuit for a deterioration diagnosis of Li-Ion battery using FFT by FPGA","confLoc":"Heraklion, Greece","sourcePdf":"92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058017S","chronDate":"28-31 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171422","isNumber":"8231858","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171422","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8231858","articleId":"8232031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8232045,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammud J.

OFDM/Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OFDM/OQAM) is selected as the FBMC system since it achieves maximum bandwidth efficiency. The theoretical achievable bit rates of the MIMO systems are also presented for both channel configurations. Preamble-based channel estimation using the Interference Approximation Method (IAM) is considered. We show that the MIMO-OFDM/OQAM systems achieve a better error performance and also a higher bit rate than the MIMO-OFDM systems in both the horizontal and vertical channels. This makes FBMC very attractive for wirelessly transmitting multimedia data such as real-time video in an UAC where the bandwidth is extremely limited.","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","pdfPath":"/iel7/8190426/8232037/08232045.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232037","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of MIMO-OFDM/OQAM in time-varying underwater acoustic channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of MIMO-OFDM/OQAM in time-varying underwater acoustic channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232045/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467508","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8232045/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of MIMO-OFDM/OQAM in time-varying underwater acoustic channels","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"170209001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057309S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8190426","isNumber":"8232037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8190426","xplore-issue":"8232037","articleId":"8232045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Marine Technology Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8232062,"authors":[{"name":"Shingo Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Kitami Institute of Technology, Kitami, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37270688500"},{"name":"Hiroshi Tanimoto","affiliation":["Kitami Institute of Technology, Kitami, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Tanimoto","id":"37282164100"},{"name":"Takashi Saito","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric TOKKI Systems Corporation., Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Saito","id":"37065553900"},{"name":"Yusaku Mabuchi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric TOKKI Systems Corporation., Kamakura, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusaku","lastName":"Mabuchi","id":"37086280373"},{"name":"Tomoya Tsukui","affiliation":["IHI Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoya","lastName":"Tsukui","id":"37086278431"},{"name":"Shinichi Sawada","affiliation":["IHI Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"Sawada","id":"37086148433"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-6929-4690-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-0-692-93559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6429-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232062","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232062","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Doppler shift","Frequency measurement","Sea measurements","Receivers","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel resampling receiver","underwater acoustic communication","nonuniform Doppler shifts","Doppler compensation","Doppler shift patterns","multiple resampling ratios","Doppler shift dispersion","simple OFDM demodulation test","carrier frequency offset compensation","CFO compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater acoustic communication","Doppler shifts","resampling","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a resampling method for underwater acoustic communication with non-uniform Doppler shifts. The current trend of Doppler compensation is two-step processing that consists of resampling and residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) compensation. In conventional approaches, a resampling ratio is assumed to be roughly constant and estimated on average in the measured Doppler shifts. However, the appropriate resampling ratio is not always consistent with the average. It can be confirmed by the simple OFDM demodulation test with various Doppler shift patterns. We propose a parallel resampling receiver using multiple resampling ratios by taking account into Doppler shift dispersion. The effectiveness of the parallel resampling has been verified by our sea trial.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232037","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","pdfPath":"/iel7/8190426/8232037/08232062.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel resampling receiver for underwater acoustic communication with non-uniform Doppler shifts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Parallel resampling receiver for underwater acoustic communication with non-uniform Doppler shifts","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8232062/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467464","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232062/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel resampling receiver for underwater acoustic communication with non-uniform Doppler shifts","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"170302010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040887S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8190426","isNumber":"8232037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8190426","xplore-issue":"8232037","articleId":"8232062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Marine Technology Society","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8232113,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyu Fu","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37531776000"},{"name":"Shasha Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Shasha","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086050212"},{"name":"Yuanhui Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China"],"firstName":"Yuanhui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407561300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-6929-4690-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-0-692-93559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6429-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232113","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven positioning control algorithm of the dynamic positioning ship","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Algorithm design and analysis","Actuators","Heuristic algorithms","Oceans","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","position control","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic positioning ship","active disturbance rejection control method","ADRC method","DP ship","Event-driven positioning control algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DP ship","positioning control","active disturbance rejection control","event-driven","variable threshold function"]}],"abstract":"An event-driven positioning control algorithm based active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is proposed for dynamic positioning (DP) ship under the influence of external disturbances. The time-driven positioning controller is firstly designed using ADRC method. Then, the event-driven condition is introduced by extending the designed positioning controller, moreover, the trigger decision function with variable threshold is developed to determine the updated time instants of the positioning controller. Besides, the proposed event-driven positioning algorithm could ensure that the error of positioning is global uniform ultimately bounded and no Zeno behavior. Compared to the existing time-driven method, the proposed algorithm reduces the amount of computation and communication, and meanwhile it can lead to little executions of actuator. The positioning control performance with DP ship and antijamming ability of the proposed algorithm is finally demonstrated through comparing the simulation results.","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","pdfPath":"/iel7/8190426/8232037/08232113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232113/","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven positioning control algorithm of the dynamic positioning ship","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452652","htmlLink":"/document/8232113/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven positioning control algorithm of the dynamic positioning ship","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"170305029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068476S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8190426","isNumber":"8232037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8190426","xplore-issue":"8232037","articleId":"8232113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Marine Technology Society","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8232117,"authors":[{"name":"Jinnian Zhang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinnian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086282469"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China","Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085611113"},{"name":"Yue Rong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Rong","id":"37285034000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-6929-4690-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-0-692-93559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6429-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232117","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Estimation","Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Iterative methods","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","computational complexity","impulse noise","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","transient response","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","impulsive noise estimation","underwater acoustic OFDM systems","underwater acoustic channel","strong impulsive noise","channel state information","high-speed data transmission","UA orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing communication systems","channel impulse response","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Underwater acoustic (UA) channel is often affected by strong impulsive noise.

By exploiting the sparsity of the impulsive noise and channel impulse response in the time domain, we adopt the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to improve the accuracy of channel estimation with relatively low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through numerical simulations and real data collected during a UA communication experiment conducted in December 2015 in the estuary of the Swan River, Western Australia.

The enhancement is achieved via two techniques: the sparse adaptation (SA) technique and the data reuse (DR) technique. The SA technique speeds up the convergence and improves the performance of the adaptive equalization, by taking advantage of the inherent sparsity of the equalizer. It is implemented as the selective zero-attracting NLMS (SZA-NLMS) algorithm, developed by introducing a range of attraction for the existing zero-attracting NLMS (ZA-NLMS) algorithm. Compared with the ZA-NLMS, the SZA-NLMS incurs a lower complexity and achieves a better performance. The DR technique effectively prolongs the training length and significantly reduces the training overhead. Attributed to the DR technique, a high transmission efficiency is achieved even for a block transmission. The proposed adaptive equalization is verified by the real data collected in an at-sea multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) underwater acoustic communication trial. The experimental results show it considerably outperforms the standard NLMS adaptive equalization, especially with a low DR number.","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","pdfPath":"/iel7/8190426/8232037/08232301.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced adaptive equalization for MIMO underwater acoustic communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232301/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced adaptive equalization for MIMO underwater acoustic communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467470","htmlLink":"/document/8232301/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced adaptive equalization for MIMO underwater acoustic communications","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"170320003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059138S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8190426","isNumber":"8232037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8190426","xplore-issue":"8232037","articleId":"8232301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Marine Technology Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8232308,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqing Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Ding","id":"37086083396"},{"name":"Yan Song","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Song","id":"37085803584"},{"name":"Jia Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085787504"},{"name":"Chen Feng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Feng","id":"37554822800"},{"name":"Guangliang Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Guangliang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086047680"},{"name":"Bo He","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"He","id":"37399325300"},{"name":"Tianhong Yan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering China, Jiliang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tianhong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085347352"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-6929-4690-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-0-692-93559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6429-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232308","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":706},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fish","Feature extraction","Mathematical model","Image recognition","Training","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","convolution","image classification","neural nets","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aquaculture","marine biology","classification methods","convolutional neural network","fish recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fish recognition","Convolutional Neural Network","Image classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232308","abstract":"Studying fish recognition has important realistic and theoretical significance to aquaculture and marine biology.

Taking advantage of magnetic field measurements of the tri-directional coils, the proposed localization algorithm uses only two anchor nodes to locate a sensor node in the 3-D space. Assuming each anchor node sequentially transmits the communication signal by three orthogonal Tx coils, and the sensor node receives the signals at the three orthogonal Rx coils simultaneously, the communication distance and the polar angles of transmission are estimated in a local coordinate system of the anchor node. These estimates from the two anchor nodes yield two sets of 8 possible locations of the sensor node. Then a Rotation Matrix (RM) between the transmitter and receiver is derived to narrow down to two possible location vectors with the opposite directions in each anchor node. Finally, we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the accurate location from the two sets of two location vectors. Simulations results show that the proposed RM-based method can achieve high localization accuracy because the derived closed-form formula of distance estimation achieves good accuracy under large measurement errors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Estimation","Wireless sensor networks","Receivers","Measurement errors","Antennas","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic induction","magnetic communication","magnetic field measurement","maximum likelihood estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal Tx coils","orthogonal Rx coils","wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor nodes","near-field magnetic induction communications","magnetic field measurements","tri-directional coils","3D node localization","communication signal","communication distance","polar angles","local coordinate system","rotation matrix","maximum likelihood method","location vectors"]}],"publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","pdfPath":"/iel7/8190426/8232037/08232341.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node localization in 3-D by magnetic-induction communications in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Node localization in 3-D by magnetic-induction communications in wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232341/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8232341/","accessionNumber":"17467479","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node localization in 3-D by magnetic-induction communications in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"170320069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05196S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8190426","isNumber":"8232037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8190426","xplore-issue":"8232037","articleId":"8232341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Marine Technology Society","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8232364,"authors":[{"name":"Yiheng Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO"],"firstName":"Yiheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086319062"},{"name":"Weiyu Cai","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO"],"firstName":"Weiyu","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086316937"},{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086316355"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-6929-4690-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-0-692-93559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6429-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232364","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"abstract":"This paper proposes a spline interpolation method to map 2D Dubins paths into 3D for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to visit multiple targets.

Step 1 uses the Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the 3D Euclidean distances as the fitness function to assign multiple tasks to multiple AUVs; Step 2 designs the 2D Dubins paths for each AUV target sequence; and Step 3 maps the 2D Dubins paths to 3D paths via cubic spline interpolaten. Finally, potential collision is detected among the resulting paths of the multiple AUVs and paths are discarded if any AUV is within the close vincinity of another AUV at any time. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields shortest Dubnis paths most of the time and gaurantees the G1 continuity. The probability of collision is very small if the multiple AUVs start the mission at the geometric center of the multiple targets.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","pdfPath":"/iel7/8190426/8232037/08232364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 - Anchorage","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dubins curves for 3D multi-vehicle path planning using spline interpolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Two dimensional displays","Genetic algorithms","Three-dimensional displays","Path planning","Splines (mathematics)","Interpolation","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","collision avoidance","genetic algorithms","integer programming","interpolation","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","probability","splines (mathematics)","target tracking","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dubins curves","spline interpolation method","multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem","NP-hard integer programming problem","Genetic Algorithm","3D Euclidean distances","cubic spline","multiple AUV","target sequence","3D multivehicle path planning","2D Dubins paths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AUVs","Path Planning Problem","Spline interpolation","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dubins curves for 3D multi-vehicle path planning using spline interpolation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8232364/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452608","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dubins curves for 3D multi-vehicle path planning using spline interpolation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"170320108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076786S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8190426","isNumber":"8232037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8190426","xplore-issue":"8232037","articleId":"8232364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Marine Technology Society","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8232367,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Tadayon","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Tadayon","id":"37086320315"},{"name":"Milica Stojanovic","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37085406787"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-6929-4690-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-0-692-93559-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6429-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8232367","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of compensating for motion-induced Doppler frequency offset in multicarrier acoustic communication systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In mobile acoustic systems, Doppler effect can be sever enough that the received OFDM signal experiences non-negligible frequency offsets even after initial resampling. To target these offsets, a practical method based on a hypothesis-testing approach is proposed. The method relies on differentially coherent detection which keeps the receiver complexity at a minimum and requires only a small pilot overhead. Differential encoding is applied across carriers, promoting the use of a large number of closely spaced carriers within a given bandwidth. This approach simultaneously supports frequency-domain coherence and efficient use of bandwidth for achieving high bit rates. While frequency synchronization capitalizes on differentially coherent detection framework, it can also be used as a pre-processing stage in coherent receivers without creating undue complexity. Using the experimental data transmitted over a 3-7 km shallow water channel in the 10.5-15.5 kHz acoustic band, we study the system performance in terms of data detection mean squared error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER), and show that the proposed method provides excellent performance at low computational cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2017 -

The latter task became the topic of the Second Annual Data Science Bowl organized by Kaggle. The dataset consisted of a large number of cases with only systole and diastole volume labels. We designed a system based on neural networks to solve this problem. It began with a detector to detect the regions of interest (ROI) containing LV chambers. Then a deep neural network named hypercolumns fully convolutional network was used to segment LV in ROI. The 2-D segmentation results were integrated across different images to estimate the volume. With ground-truth volume labels, this model was trained end-to-end. To improve the result, an additional dataset with only segmentation labels was used. The model was trained alternately on these two tasks. We also proposed a variance estimation method for the final prediction. Our algorithm ranked the fourth on the test set in this competition.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Proposals","Neural networks","Heart","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cardiology","diseases","image classification","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRI images","deep neural network","human left ventricle","magnetic resonance imaging images","cardiac diseases","systole","diastole volume labels","neural networks","ROI","hypercolumns fully convolutional network","2-D segmentation results","ground-truth volume labels","segmentation labels","variance estimation method","LV","annual data science bowl"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","image segmentation","medical image analysis","regression"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Heart Ventricles","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Neural Networks, Computer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232462","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2778799","startPage":"495","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8612980/08232462.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2778799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232462/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of the Volume of the Left Ventricle From MRI Images Using Deep Neural Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18379381","pubMedId":"29990055","htmlLink":"/document/8232462/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329403"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273023, 91420201 and 61332007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of the Volume of the Left Ventricle From MRI Images Using Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcyb-hu-2778799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134775S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8612980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8612980","articleId":"8232462","onlineDate":"20 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8232533,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Burg","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, Lausanne"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/8232482/8232533/burg-2780172-small.gif","p":["Andreas Burg (Member, IEEE) was born in Munich, Germany, in 1975.

In such complex, heterogeneous systems, communication links must meet stringent requirements on throughput, latency, and range, while adhering to tight energy budget and providing high levels of security. In this paper, we first summarize wireless communication principles from the perspective of the connectivity needs of IoT and CPS. Based on these principles, we then review the most relevant wireless communication standards before focusing on the key security issues and features of such systems. In particular, the gap between the security features in the communication standards used in CPSs and IoT and their actual vulnerabilities are pointed out with practical examples and recent attacks. We emphasize the need for a more in-depth study of the security issues across all the protocol layers, including both logical layer security and physical layer security.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","volume":"106","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17481911","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8232533/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Communication and Security Issues for Cyber\u2013Physical Systems and the Internet-of-Things","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Wireless Communication and Security Issues for Cyber\u2013Physical Systems and the Internet-of-Things","sourcePdf":"jproc-burg-2780172-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162843S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8232482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"8232482","articleId":"8232533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8232537,"authors":[{"name":"Marilyn Wolf","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/8232482/8232537/wolf-2781198-small.gif","p":["Marilyn Wolf (Fellow, IEEE) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 1980, 1981, and 1984, respectively.","She is Rhesa S. \u201cRay\u201d Farmer Distinguished Chair in Embedded Computing Systems and Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA.

The introduction of computing elements to create cyber-physical systems (CPSs) has opened up a vast new range of potential problems that do not always show up on the radar of traditional engineers. Security, in contrast, is traditionally viewed as a data or communications security problem to be handled by computer scientists and/or computer engineers. Advances in CPSs and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) requires us to take a unified view of safety and security. This paper defines a safety/security threat model for CPSs and IoT systems and surveys emerging techniques which improve the safety and security of CPSs and IoT systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8232537/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17481909","volume":"106","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Safety and Security in Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safety and Security in Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-wolf-2781198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108829S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"8232482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8232482","articleId":"8232537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8232587,"authors":[{"name":"Wenchao Xu","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Wenchao","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Haibo Zhou","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Nan Cheng","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Feng Lyu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lyu"},{"name":"Weisen Shi","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Weisen","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Jiayin Chen","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Xuemin Shen","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Xuemin","lastName":"Shen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-9266"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-9274"}],"articleNumber":"8232587","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big Data","Sensors","Roads","Internet","Safety","Intelligent vehicles","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","performance evaluation","protocols","radio access networks","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modern vehicles","heterogeneous radio access technologies","long term information processing","IoV big data","big data era","Internet of vehicles","automotive telematics","transportation system","communication protocol design","Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","autonomous vehicles"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8232587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570654/8232582/08232587.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JAS.2017.7510736","doi":"10.1109/JAS.2017.7510736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8232582","publicationTitle":"IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internet of vehicles in big data era","abstract":"As the rapid development of automotive telematics, modern vehicles are expected to be connected through heterogeneous radio access technologies and are able to exchange massive information with their surrounding environment.

In this article, we first investigate the relationship between IoV and big data in vehicular environment, mainly on how IoV supports the transmission, storage, computing of the big data, and in return how IoV benefits from big data in terms of IoV characterization, performance evaluation and big data assisted communication protocol design. We then investigate the application of IoV big data for autonomous vehicles.

This is of great importance to a vehicle's safety and ride comfort. In the U.S state of California, the Autonomous Vehicle Testing Regulations require every manufacturer testing autonomous vehicles on public roads to submit an annual report summarizing the disengagements of the technology experienced during testing. On 1 January 2016, seven manufacturers submitted their first disengagement reports: Bosch, Delphi, Google, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Tesla Motors. This work analyses the data from these disengagement reports with the aim of gaining abetter understanding of the situations in which a driver is required to takeover, as this is potentially useful in improving the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 and Level 3 automation technologies. Disengagement events from testing are classified into different groups based on attributes and the causes of disengagement are investigated and compared in detail. The mechanisms and time taken for take-over transition occurred in disengagements are studied.

A robot-virtual human bilateral trust model is derived and a real-time trust measurement method is developed.

A plane view section of a specificlayer in a semiconductor device can be prepared by this technique with a spatialresolution of less than 1 \u00b5m. This method uses mechanical polishingwith a tripod-polisher in conjunction with chemical etching. First, the top side of the specimen is polished down to the layer of interest, andthen the silicon substrate on the bottom side is polished by using a tripodpolisher to form a tapered wedge-shape with the region of interestpositioned at the edge. It is then subjected to chemical etching by potassiumhydroxide to remove the leftover silicon. By using this method, a 400 nm thicktitanium silicide layer can be extracted from a multi-layered semiconductordevice for plane view TEM observation, and the microstructures of the silicidelayer, which affect the electrical properties of the device, can be investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8232874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2001","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2001","publicationDate":"Jan. 2001","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"50","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Preparation of TEM plane view sections on semiconductor device usingthe tripod-polisher and chemical etching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preparation of TEM plane view sections on semiconductor device usingthe tripod-polisher and chemical etching","sourcePdf":"500009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051868S","chronDate":"Jan.  2001","isNumber":"8232871","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016812","articleId":"8232874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8233104,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c0lex Oliveras Mart\u00ednez","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8233104/marti-2785860-small.gif","p":["\u00c0lex Oliveras Mart\u00ednez received the combined B.S. and M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Universitat Politcnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, in 2013.

However, adding a second antenna to the user handset opens the possibility to exploit multiplexing techniques and obtain higher throughput. This paper is based on a measurement campaign comprising a BS with 64 elements reconfigurable into three shapes: 1) a very large array with 6-m aperture; 2) a large array with 2m aperture; and 3) a compact two dimensional array with 25 cm by 28 cm sides. We study the throughput in single-user and multi-user scenarios using both non-linear optimal and linear precoders. The experimental results show that the throughput increases when adding a second antenna, but the increase is lower than in Gaussian channels due to the intra-user correlation. However, increasing the number of BS antennas, massive MIMO achieves more benefits from the second antenna. A large number of users in the system and the inter-user correlation reduce the benefits of a second antenna in the user handset.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08233104.pdf","startPage":"2899","endPage":"2907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Study of the Benefits of a Second Antenna at the User Side in a Massive MIMO System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","MIMO communication","Telephone sets","Throughput","Antenna arrays","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","codecs","Gaussian channels","linear codes","MIMO communication","multiplexing","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO system","base station antennas","single-antenna users","user handset","measurement campaign","compact two dimensional array","linear precoders","intra-user correlation","BS antennas","inter-user correlation","size 2.0 m","size 25.0 cm","size 28.0 cm","BS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","multi-user MIMO","channel measurements","indoor propagation","antenna arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Study of the Benefits of a Second Antenna at the User Side in a Massive MIMO System","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8233104/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542756","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Danish Council for Independent Research (Det Frie Forskningsr\u00e5d)","grantNumber":"DFF133500273"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Experimental Study of the Benefits of a Second Antenna at the User Side in a Massive MIMO System","sourcePdf":"access-oliverasmartinez-2785860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067433S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8233104","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8233108,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8430490/8233108/tang-2785861-small.gif","p":["Jie Tang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communication systems and signal processing from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K., in 2012.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology.

In this paper, we address the energy efficiency (EE) optimization problem for SWIPT multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel (BC) with time-switching (TS) receiver design. Our aim is to maximize the EE of the system whilst satisfying certain constraints in terms of maximum transmit power and minimum harvested energy per user. The coupling of the optimization variables, namely transmit covariance matrices and TS ratios, leads to an EE problem which is nonconvex, and hence very difficult to solve directly. Hence, we transform the original maximization problem with multiple constraints into a suboptimal min-max problem with a single constraint and multiple auxiliary variables. We propose a dual inner/outer layer resource allocation framework to tackle the problem. For the inner-layer, we invoke an extended SWIPT-based BC-multiple access channel (MAC) duality approach and provide two iterative resource allocation schemes under fixed auxiliary variables for solving the dual MAC problem. A subgradient searching scheme is then proposed for the outer-layer in order to obtain the optimal auxiliary variables. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and illustrate that significant performance gain in terms of EE can be achieved by adopting the proposed extended BC-MAC duality-based algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2785861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2785861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8430490/08233108.pdf","startPage":"2605","endPage":"2619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization With SWIPT in MIMO Broadcast Channels for Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization With SWIPT in MIMO Broadcast Channels for Internet of Things","volume":"5","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233108/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18025506","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601186"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"1714050004216"},{"fundingName":"Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission","grantNumber":"201707010159"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"2018D03"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17JC43"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N008219/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Optimization With SWIPT in MIMO Broadcast Channels for Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-tang-2785861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150883S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8430490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8430490","articleId":"8233108","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233109,"authors":[{"name":"Senlin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8233109/zhang-2785763-small.gif","p":["Senlin Zhang (M\u201911) received the B.E. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1984, and the M.E. degree in control theory and control engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1991.

Methods based on relay protection actions and electrical component actions have been put forward in recent years. However, they have deficiencies dealing with power system fault. In this paper, a method for data-based line trip fault prediction in power systems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. The temporal features of multisourced data are captured with LSTM networks, which perform well in extracting the features of time series for a long-time span. The strong learning and mining ability of LSTM networks is suitable for a large quantity of time series in power transmission and distribution. SVM, with a strong generalization ability and robustness, is introduced for classification to get the final prediction results. Considering the overfitting problem in fault prediction, layer of dropout and batch normalization are added into the network. The complete network architecture is shown in this paper in detail. The parameters are adjusted to fit the specific situation of the actual power system. The data for experiments are obtained from the Wanjiang substation in the China Southern Power Grid. The real experiments prove the proposed method's improvements compared with current data mining methods. Concrete analyses of results are elaborated in this paper. A discussion of practical applications is presented to demonstrate the feasibility in real scenarios.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08233109.pdf","startPage":"7675","endPage":"7686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Based Line Trip Fault Prediction in Power Systems Using LSTM Networks and SVM","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233109","topic":"Advanced Data Analytics for Large-scale Complex Data Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-Based Line Trip Fault Prediction in Power Systems Using LSTM Networks and SVM","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612372","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8233109/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LZ15F030001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data-Based Line Trip Fault Prediction in Power Systems Using LSTM Networks and SVM","sourcePdf":"access-liu-2785763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078144S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Advanced Data Analytics for Large-scale Complex Data Environments"],"articleId":"8233109","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8233110,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["College of Energy and Electrical Engineering, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/8515215/8233110/zhang-2785819-small.gif","p":["Li Zhang (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2007, and 2012, respectively.","From 2012 to 2014, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

In this paper, an open-loop NP potential balancing control for 5L-NPC full-bridge grid-tied inverters (FB-GCIs) is proposed. A balancing factor k is introduced into the modulation signals and regulated according to the calculation results of the modulation index. Therefore, although the voltages of split dc-link capacitors have not been sampled and controlled, the dc-link capacitor voltages can be balanced over a wide modulation index range. Both the switching states and the NP potential balancing region of the 5L-NPC FB-GCI are analyzed in detail. The design guidelines of the balancing factor k are also presented. A 5L-NPC FB-GCI prototype is built for the experimental tests, and experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8515215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2785819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/8515215/08233110.pdf","startPage":"2042","endPage":"2052","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2785819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control Method for Five-Level Full-Bridge Grid-Tied Inverters Without Split-Capacitor Voltage Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control Method for Five-Level Full-Bridge Grid-Tied Inverters Without Split-Capacitor Voltage Sampling","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8233110/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18199411","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51677054"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"XNY-008"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Science and Technology Plan","grantNumber":"Z161100002616039"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"KZ201511232035"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"2015B02314"},{"fundingName":"111 project","grantNumber":"B14022"},{"fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control Method for Five-Level Full-Bridge Grid-Tied Inverters Without Split-Capacitor Voltage Sampling","sourcePdf":"jestpe-zhang-2785819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084487S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"8515215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8515215","articleId":"8233110","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8233128,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-6674-3382","id":"37086330875"},{"name":"Naoki Tominaga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Tominaga","orcid":"0000-0002-8884-7243","id":"37085788339"},{"name":"Yusuke Sogabe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Sogabe","orcid":"0000-0003-1692-629X","id":"37085416980"},{"name":"Takashi Kikuchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Kikuchi","id":"37086333511"},{"name":"Stuart Wimbush","affiliation":["Robinson Research Institute, Victoria University of Wellington, Lower Hutt, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Wimbush","orcid":"0000-0003-1636-643X","id":"37313589700"},{"name":"Simon Granville","affiliation":["Robinson Research Institute, Victoria University of Wellington, Lower Hutt, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Granville","id":"37663262100"},{"name":"Naoyuki Amemiya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyuki","lastName":"Amemiya","orcid":"0000-0002-3000-864X","id":"37268918900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"8233128","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233128","abstract":"We carried out electromagnetic field analyses on the shielding-current-induced field (SCIF) of a cosine-theta dipole magnet, which is wound with coated conductors with finite electric field (E)-current density (J) characteristics and must ramp up its magnetic field.

The project aims to develop a tracking device capable of fully reconstructing the four momentum of fast and ultrafast secondary neutrons produced, e.g., in particle therapy (PT) treatments or in other physical processes. The MONDO tracker uses, as active material, squared scintillating fibers readout by dedicated CMOS-based digital single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array sensors. The expected light output, when operating in neutron monitoring applications, was experimentally evaluated in order to optimize the design of the MONDO detector readout. A small detector prototype (4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4.8 cm) has been built and tested at a test beam facility. The detection capabilities have been measured using a traditional photomultiplier (PMT) and a particle beam of 450-MeV electrons crossing a single layer of fibers. The observed number of photoelectrons in this case is (7.2 \u00b1 1.4). A detector prototype was also tested with an SPAD-based SBAM (SPAD-Based Acquisition readout for MONDO experiment) sensor (SPADnet-I) to study the tracking performances. SBAM is a novel sensor developed to match the need of high single-photon detection efficiency and high spatial resolution and compactness. The sensor expected performance is discussed in view of an operation tailored for PT applications.

Fuzzy systems are employed to tackle the problem from packaged unknown nonlinearities, and the backstepping and robust adaptive control techniques are applied to design the controller by adopting the structural characteristics of fuzzy systems and the common Lyapunov function approach. By using Lyapunov stability theory, the semiglobally uniformly ultimate boundness in the fourth-moment of all closed-loop signals is guaranteed, and the system output is ensured to converge to a small neighborhood of the given trajectory. The main advantages of this paper lie in the fact that both the completely nonaffine form and nonlower triangular structure are taken into account for the controlled systems, and the increasing property of whole state functions is removed by using the structural characteristics of fuzzy systems. The developed control method is verified through a numerical example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","volume":"48","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17935378","pubMedId":"29990053","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8233131/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Fuzzy Adaptive Tracking Control for Nonaffine Stochastic Nonlinear Switching Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773072, 61773051 and 61773073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Fuzzy Adaptive Tracking Control for Nonaffine Stochastic Nonlinear Switching Systems","sourcePdf":"tcyb-wang-2740841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122849S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8412163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8412163","articleId":"8233131","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8233133,"authors":[{"name":"Kijeong Han","affiliation":["PowerAmerica Institute, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kijeong","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0002-1006-0694","id":"37086116367"},{"name":"B.

In this paper, a W-band two-way balanced PA based on a compact quadrature coupler with a broadside coupled stripline (BCSL) as the core is presented to enhance the load-variation insensitivity and stability. The proposed coupler is truly broadband with low amplitude and phase imbalance. The proposed W-band balanced PA achieves higher power-added efficiency (PAE) and unsaturated output power sat over wide frequency bandwidth.

However, at high altitudes, acquiring the channel state information (CSI) for HAPs, which is a key requirement to perform beamforming, is challenging. In this paper, by exploiting an interference alignment (IA) technique, a novel method for achieving the maximum sum-rate in HAP-based communications without CSI is proposed. In particular, to realize IA, a multiple-antenna tethered balloon is used as a relay between multiple HAP drones and ground stations (GSs). Here, a multiple-input multiple-output X network system is considered. The capacity of the considered M \u00d7 N X network with a tethered balloon relay is derived in closed-form. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings and show that the proposed approach yields the maximum sum-rate in multiple HAPs-GSs communications in absence of CSI. The results also show the existence of an optimal balloon's altitude for which the sum-rate is maximized.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4234/8375700/8233141-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","volume":"22","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"17839001","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8233141/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Analysis for High Altitude Platform (HAP) Drones With Tethered Balloon Relay","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office (ARO)","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-1-0593"},{"fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"AST-1506297"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Sum-Rate Analysis for High Altitude Platform (HAP) Drones With Tethered Balloon Relay","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mozaffari-2785847-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091509S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8375700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8375700","articleId":"8233141","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233145,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Wireless-Optical Communications, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8233145/zhou-2785766-small.gif","p":["Jing Zhou received the Ph.D. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2013.

Gaussian or complex Gaussian codebook ensemble and nearest neighbor decoding (minimum Euclidean distance decoding) are used. We obtain an array of information rate result. These results validate existing signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio-based rate analysis, establish the equivalence of information rates of certain schemes, and demonstrate the evident benefits of using component-multiplexing at high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR).

A new test is generated by slightly mutating a seed input. If the test exercises a new and interesting path, it is added to the set of seeds; otherwise, it is discarded. We observe that most tests exercise the same few \u201chigh-frequency\u201d paths and develop strategies to explore significantly more paths with the same number of tests by gravitating towards low-frequency paths. We explain the challenges and opportunities of CGF using a Markov chain model which specifies the probability that fuzzing the seed that exercises path i generates an input that exercises path j. Each state (i.e., seed) has an energy that specifies the number of inputs to be generated from that seed. We show that CGF is considerably more efficient if energy is inversely proportional to the density of the stationary distribution and increases monotonically every time that seed is chosen. Energy is controlled with a power schedule. We implemented several schedules by extending AFL. In 24 hours, AFLFast exposes 3 previously unreported CVEs that are not exposed by AFL and exposes 6 previously unreported CVEs 7x faster than AFL. AFLFast produces at least an order of magnitude more unique crashes than AFL. We compared AFLFast to the symbolic executor Klee. In terms of vulnerability detection, AFLFast is significantly more effective than Klee on the same subject programs that were discussed in the original Klee paper. In terms of code coverage, AFLFast only slightly outperforms Klee while a combination of both tools achieves best results by mitigating the individual weaknesses.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2017.2785841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2017.2785841","startPage":"489","endPage":"506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/8714098/08233151.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8714098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage-Based Greybox Fuzzing as Markov Chain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Coverage-Based Greybox Fuzzing as Markov Chain","volume":"45","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18657137","publicationDate":"1 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8233151/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011512","fundingName":"National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"NRF2014NCR-NCR001-21"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage-Based Greybox Fuzzing as Markov Chain","sourcePdf":"tse-bohme-2785841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.238318S","chronDate":"May 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"8714098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8714098","articleId":"8233151","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233153,"authors":[{"name":"Avik Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687307/8307506/8233153/baner-2785769-small.gif","p":["Avik Banerjee is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India.

A novel frame structure of radio frequency energy harvesting (EH)-cooperation-transmission is considered that operates in time switching mode. The relays also help (cooperation phase) in data transmission between the primary transmitter and receiver using a fraction of the harvested energy. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the end-to-end secondary outage probability under the constraints of energy causality and primary user cooperation rate. Closed form expressions of the optimal time duration for EH and power allocation factor on each relay are also derived. In order to minimize the total power consumption (cost) and to enhance the network lifetime, the optimal route selection is also explored using Bellman-Ford algorithm and the efficacy of the same over Dijkstra's algorithm is also demonstrated by a large set of simulation results. Simulation results also show that a gain in outage probability ~43.57% and ~56.66% is achieved for the proposed approach over the existing works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and

and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Electricity-Theft Detection to Secure Smart Grids","abstract":"Electricity theft is harmful to power grids. Integrating information flows with energy flows, smart grids can help to solve the problem of electricity theft owning to the availability of massive data generated from smart grids. The data analysis on the data of smart grids is helpful in detecting electricity theft because of the abnormal electricity consumption pattern of energy thieves. However, the existing methods have poor detection accuracy of electricity theft since most of them were conducted on one-dimensional (1-D) electricity consumption data and failed to capture the periodicity of electricity consumption. In this paper, we originally propose a novel electricity-theft detection method based on wide and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to address the above concerns. In particular, wide and deep CNN model consists of two components: the wide component and the deep CNN component. The deep CNN component can accurately identify the nonperiodicity of electricity theft and the periodicity of normal electricity usage based on 2-D electricity consumption data. Meanwhile, the wide component can capture the global features of 1-D electricity consumption data. As a result, wide and deep CNN model can achieve the excellent performance in electricity-theft detection. Extensive experiments based on realistic dataset show that wide and deep CNN model outperforms other existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233155/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17682778","volume":"14","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wide and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Electricity-Theft Detection to Secure Smart Grids","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFB1000101"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61722214 and 61472338"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams","grantNumber":"2016ZT06D211"},{"fundingName":"Pearl River S & T Nova Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201710010046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Electricity-Theft Detection to Secure Smart Grids","sourcePdf":"tii-dai-2785963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181513S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8331183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"8331183","articleId":"8233155","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8233158,"authors":[{"name":"Kede Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6745852/8287087/8233158/ma-2786138-small.gif","p":["Kede Ma (S\u201913) received the B.E. degree from the University of\n Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2012 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer\n engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"Phase retrieval is an important tool for image recovery techniques based on Fourier spectrum. Different iterative algorithms have been developed to retrieve phase information. However, due to the nonconvex feature of the phase optimization problem, it remains a challenge to globally obtain the optimal phase information. In this work, we proposed an iterative algorithm to retrieve the global optimal phase information by adopting particle swarm optimization technique to the hybrid input-output scheme. By escaping the local minima using stochastic perturbations and information exchange among particles' local solutions, the proposed scheme increases the possibility of reaching the global minimum in phase retrieval optimization. In the numerical simulations, the images reconstructed by the proposed scheme have an averaged mean-square error of 0.0055, which is, respectively, 43.88% and 36.78% smaller than those of the images reconstructed by hybrid input-output and guided hybrid input-output schemes. The feasibility of the proposed scheme was demonstrated by the results from actual experiments, which showed an agreement with the simulation. The proposed scheme is statistically capable of obtaining accurate phase information, and, therefore, can be applied to Fourier spectrum based image recovery techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233163/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7800109","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17481873","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8233163/","impactStatement":"Utilizing particle swarm optimization, we proposed an PSHIO algorithm to increase the possibility of reaching global minimum in phase retrieval optimization by escaping the local minima using stochastic perturbations and information exchange among particles local solutions.

Since the performance of the ESO is dominated by the choice of the gain parameter, the goal of this paper is to analyze the behavior of the observation error when the gain parameter varies from zero to infinity. We show that for the ESO considered, there exists a certain threshold such that if the gain parameter is smaller than this threshold, the observation error at steady state will become unbounded. An upper bound on the asymptotic observation error is also proposed, which is proved to be bounded and convergent utilizing set-theoretic techniques. For the case where the closed-loop matrix of the ESO is nonnegative, a tighter upper bound on the asymptotic observation error is also proposed. The proposed theoretic results are illustrated by the simulation results and the experimental verifications on a direct current motor loading platform.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2780161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2780161","startPage":"2256","endPage":"2268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8369410/08233167.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8369410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Assessment of Discrete-Time Extended State Observers: Theoretical and Experimental Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance Assessment of Discrete-Time Extended State Observers: Theoretical and Experimental Results","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17801687","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8233167/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503027 and 51675041"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005085","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complete Systems, School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC Theme-Based Project","grantNumber":"T23-701/14N"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Assessment of Discrete-Time Extended State Observers: Theoretical and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"tcsi-shi-2780161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141485S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8233167","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233168,"authors":[{"name":"Anestis Tsakmalis","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8295180/8233168/tsakm-2785826-small.gif","p":["Anestis Tsakmalis received the M.Eng. degree in telecommunications\n from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2009, the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications\n from the University of Thessaly, Volos, Greece, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the\n Interdisciplinary Center for Security and Trust, (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, in\n 2017.

The main idea is that the CRN probes the PU, and subsequently, eavesdrops the reverse PU link to acquire the binary ACK/NACK packet. This feedback indicates whether the probing-induced interference is harmful or not and can be used to learn the PU interference constraint. The cognitive part of this sequential probing process is the selection of the power levels of the secondary users that aims to learn the PU interference constraint with a minimum number of probing attempts while setting a limit on the number of harmful probing-induced interference events or equivalently of NACK packet observations over a time window. This constrained design problem is studied within the active learning (AL) framework and an optimal solution is derived and implemented with a sophisticated, accurate, and fast Bayesian learning method, the expectation propagation. The performance of this solution is also demonstrated through numerical simulations and compared with modified versions of AL techniques we developed in earlier work.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2785826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8295180/08233168.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8295180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2785826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"6","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Bayesian Active Learning of Interference Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Bayesian Active Learning of Interference Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233168/","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8233168/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17596289","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"H2020 European Research Council"},{"fundingName":"AGNOSTIC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Bayesian Active Learning of Interference Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-tsakmalis-2785826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097291S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8295180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","xplore-issue":"8295180","articleId":"8233168","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8233171,"authors":[{"name":"Le Zheng","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8295180/8233171/zheng-2785783-small.gif","p":["Le Zheng (M\u201917) was born in 1987, in the Province of Hebei, P.\n R.

In this paper, we consider an uncoordinated scenario where a communication receiver is to operate in the presence of a number of radars, of which only a subset may be active, which poses the problem of estimating the active waveforms and the relevant parameters thereof, so as to cancel them prior to demodulation. Two algorithms are proposed for such a joint waveform estimation/data demodulation problem, both exploiting sparsity of a proper representation of the interference and of the vector containing the errors of the data block, so as to implement an iterative joint interference removal/data demodulation process. The former algorithm is based on classical on-grid compressed sensing, whereas the latter forces an atomic norm (AN) constraint: In both cases the radar parameters and the communication demodulation errors can be estimated by solving a convex problem. We also propose a way to improve the efficiency of the AN-based algorithm. The performance of these algorithms are demonstrated through extensive simulations, taking into account a variety of conditions concerning both the interferers and the respective channel states.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2785783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8295180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2785783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics

enables fast acquisition, which is highly desirable for numerous clinical applications. This can not only reduce the scanning cost and ease patient burden, but also potentially reduce motion artefacts and the effect of contrast washout, thus yielding better image quality. Different from parallel imaging-based fast MRI, which utilizes multiple coils to simultaneously receive MR signals, CS-MRI breaks the Nyquist-Shannon sampling barrier to reconstruct MRI images with much less required raw data. This paper provides a deep learning-based strategy for reconstruction of CS-MRI, and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning methods working only on data from a single image, and prior knowledge from large training data sets. In particular, a novel conditional Generative Adversarial Networks-based model (DAGAN)-based model is proposed to reconstruct CS-MRI. In our DAGAN architecture, we have designed a refinement learning method to stabilize our U-Net based generator, which provides an end-to-end network to reduce aliasing artefacts. To better preserve texture and edges in the reconstruction, we have coupled the adversarial loss with an innovative content loss. In addition, we incorporate frequency-domain information to enforce similarity in both the image and frequency domains. We have performed comprehensive comparison studies with both conventional CS-MRI reconstruction methods and newly investigated deep learning approaches. Compared with these methods, our DAGAN method provides superior reconstruction with preserved perceptual image details. Furthermore, each image is reconstructed in about 5 ms, which is suitable for real-time processing.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2017.2785879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8370207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2017.2785879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/8370207/08233175.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DAGAN: Deep De-Aliasing Generative Adversarial Networks for Fast Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"DAGAN: Deep De-Aliasing Generative Adversarial Networks for Fast Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction","volume":"37","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233175/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17805239","pubMedId":"29870361","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233175/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000274","fundingName":"British Heart Foundation Project Grant","grantNumber":"PG/16/78/32402"},{"fundingName":"NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit"},{"fundingName":"Royal Brompton Hospital and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"},{"fundingName":"Jaywing plc"},{"fundingName":"Optimise Portal"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DAGAN: Deep De-Aliasing Generative Adversarial Networks for Fast Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tmi-yang-2785879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151642S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"8370207","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"8370207","articleId":"8233175","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233180,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-2541-6283","id":"38240992500"},{"name":"Wen-De Zhong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wen-De","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37279780200"},{"name":"Helin Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Helin","lastName":"Yang","id":"38575827800"},{"name":"Pengfei Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Du","orcid":"0000-0002-1096-8125","id":"37086047498"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"8233180","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11296},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233180","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","NOMA","Resource management","Visible light communication","Modulation","Complexity theory","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","indoor communication","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-NOMA-based visible light communication systems","nonorthogonal multiple access technique","sum rate","multiple-input multiple-output-based multiuser visible light communication systems","low-complexity power allocation","indoor MIMO-NOMA-based VLC systems","normalized gain difference power allocation method","channel conditions","numerical simulations","NGDPA method","gain ratio power allocation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication (VLC)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to improve the achievable sum rate of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based multi-user visible light communication (VLC) systems.

The basic idea of this study is to use a self-organizing fuzzy neural network to imitate control law directly, and then, appeal to obtain a compact structure of controller to further reduce the computational burden and enhance the control performance. First, an effective criterion, using the tracking performance and structure risk of controller, is developed to self-organize the control rules online for SOIC to improve the tracking performance. Second, the structure and parameters of SOIC are updated by an adaptive projection-type algorithm to reduce the heavy computational burden to speed up the control response.

We first formulate the distributed power control problem as a non-cooperative game and then extend it to a repeated game with imperfect public monitoring. The repeated game formulation prevents deceitful small cells from deviating from the social optimal solution for their own benefit. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the formulated non-cooperative game. We also characterize the set of public perfect equilibrium for the repeated game. A two-phase distributed algorithm is proposed to achieve and enforce a Pareto optimal transmit power profile. The solution obtained by this algorithm is also social optimal. Phase 1 of the algorithm is a fully distributed learning phase based on perturbed Markov chains, where each base station individually learns a Pareto optimal operating point. Phase 2 is composed of two rules: 1) a detection rule based on Page-Hinckley test to detect cheating and 2) a punishment rule to motivate cheating base stations to cooperate. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed distributed power control mechanism achieves a public perfect equilibrium point of the formulated repeated game. The power control algorithm is also cheat-proof and needs only a small amount of information exchange among network nodes. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown through numerical analysis. Our proposed model, algorithm, and analysis are also valid for a half-duplex system as a special case.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08233186.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cheat-Proof Distributed Power Control in Full-Duplex Small Cell Networks: A Repeated Game With Imperfect Public Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cheat-Proof Distributed Power Control in Full-Duplex Small Cell Networks: A Repeated Game With Imperfect Public Monitoring","volume":"66","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233186/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699066","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233186/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Discovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cheat-Proof Distributed Power Control in Full-Duplex Small Cell Networks: A Repeated Game With Imperfect Public Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hossain-2785765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147541S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8233186","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233198,"authors":[{"name":"Navid R.

These drives often vary in topology, semiconductor design, and principles of operation. They each have their own merits, not only in terms of structure, design, and reliability, but also with regard to suitability to specific applications. This paper presents a technology overview of commercially available medium-voltage drive topologies with a view on how they match to petrochemical applications. The operating and performance characteristics of each drive topology are reviewed while manufacturer-specific implementation details are excluded. Common industry and application requirements such as harmonics, motor compatibility, regeneration capability, dynamic performance, and robustness to system power disturbances are used as comparison criteria.

In this letter, to resolve this interference problem, we propose a new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi stations to efficiently coexist with PBs. PBs contend just as Wi-Fi stations to gain opportunity for transferring energy and determine its operation based on the average energy level of stations.

Many methods have been proposed for extracting the degradation rate from operational data of PV systems, but most of the published approaches are susceptible to bias due to inverter clipping, module soiling, temporary outages, seasonality, and sensor degradation. In this paper, we propose a methodology for determining PV degradation leveraging available modeled clear-sky irradiance data rather than site sensor data, and a robust year-over-year rate calculation. We show the method to provide reliable degradation rate estimates even in the case of sensor drift, data shifts, and soiling. Compared with alternate methods, we demonstrate that the proposed method delivers the lowest uncertainty in degradation rate estimates for a fleet of 486 PV systems.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.2779779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503869/8294004/08233204.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8294004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOTOV.2017.2779779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust PV Degradation Methodology and Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233204","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5503869/8294004/8233204-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Robust PV Degradation Methodology and Application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233204/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17595862","htmlLink":"/document/8233204/","volume":"8","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-AC36-08-GO28308"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006233","fundingName":"National Renewable Energy Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Robust PV Degradation Methodology and Application","sourcePdf":"jphotov-jordan-2779779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054273S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503869","isNumber":"8294004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503869","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8294004","articleId":"8233204","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233207,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8352604/8233207/zhu-2785795-small.gif","p":["Yue Zhu received the BSc degree in computer science and technology\n from Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China, in 2011.

Existing approaches either assume that the label correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label correlations are local and shared only by a data subset. In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances. Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is, it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the full-label and the missing-label cases, exploiting global and local label correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing label manifolds. The extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach on both full-label and missing-label data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17736808","volume":"30","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8233207/","publicationDate":"1 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Label Learning with Global and Local Label Correlation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61333014"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization"},{"fundingName":"program B for Outstanding PhD candidate of Nanjing University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Label Learning with Global and Local Label Correlation","sourcePdf":"tkde-zhu-2785795-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227395S","chronDate":"June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8352604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8352604","articleId":"8233207","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":8233208,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjeev Sharma","affiliation":["IIT Indore, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Sharma","orcid":"0000-0001-7488-1064","id":"37085377484"},{"name":"Anubha Gupta","affiliation":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anubha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085376557"},{"name":"Vimal Bhatia","affiliation":["IIT Indore, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Vimal","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37085366171"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8233208","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Blanking","Bit error rate","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Correlators","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","impulse noise","multipath channels","ultra wideband communication","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB signal blanking loss","bit error rate performance","nonlinear receivers","robust impulse radio-ultra-wide band receiver design","standardized IEEE 802.15.4a channel models","channel estimation","multipath channel","multiple UWB signal clusters","received UWB signal cluster sparsity characteristics","IR-UWB communication","impulse noise mitigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulse noise","impulse radio-ultra-wide band (IR-UWB)","non-linear receiver"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233208","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8309483/08233208.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2785848","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2785848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulse Noise Mitigation in IR-UWB Communication Using Signal Cluster Sparsity","abstract":"In this letter, we propose a novel robust impulse radio-ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) receiver design that utilizes the received UWB signal cluster sparsity characteristics to mitigate impulse noise (IN).

Collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique, is used to obtain samples from the joint distribution of the speech mixtures. Then the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) within the framework of the Dirichlet Process (DP) is exploited to cluster samples into different components to finally estimate the number of speakers. The accuracy of the proposed method, under different reverberant environments, is evaluated with real binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) and speech signals from the TIMIT database.

This paper addresses the design and implementation of a beamformer with a frequency-dependent limitation of its aperture such that the frequency-dependence of its resolution is eliminated. Operating across a number of octaves, firstly an octave-invariance design is achieved by means of a nested array structure. Secondly, within each octave, a frequency-dependent aperture control then removes the remaining frequency-dependency. By exploiting Fourier properties and correspondences between coefficient and beamspace, we show that this design is exact, and can accommodate the inclusion of arbitrary shading and different look directions.","doi":"10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233239","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8233042/8233211/08233239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233239","publicationTitle":"2017 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a Flexible Frequency-Invariant Broadband Beamformer Based on Fourier Properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a Flexible Frequency-Invariant Broadband Beamformer Based on Fourier Properties","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233239/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233239/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452303","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a Flexible Frequency-Invariant Broadband Beamformer Based on Fourier Properties","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1205464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086035S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8233042","isNumber":"8233211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8233042","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8233211","articleId":"8233239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8233246,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Rusu","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Rusu","id":"37085393293"},{"name":"John Thompson","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37273630300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1663-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1664-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8233246","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Signal processing","Convex functions","Noise measurement","Partitioning algorithms","Symmetric matrices","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","mean square error methods","optimisation","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["node sampling","partially observed noisy measurements","graph structure","convex optimization techniques","low mean squared error","sampling set construction approach","real-world graphs","graph partitioning","complete graph signal reconstruction","sensor management","positioning problem","selection problem","numerical simulation","synthetic graphs"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we deal with the problem of efficiently and accurately reconstructing a complete graph signal from partially observed noisy measurements.

The inherent interferences within a MIMO system call for appropriate signal processing strategies. Polynomial schemes such as polynomial matrix singular value decomposition (PMSVD) have attracted the research interest since they do not require any block transmission compared with schemes such as spatio-temporal vector coding (STVC). In comparison to SVD-based STVC schemes, where the whole MIMO system is transferred into a number frequency non- selective non-interfering single-input single-output (SISO) systems, PMSVD transfers the MIMO system into independent SISO layers exhibiting a frequency-selective characteristic. In this work optimal power allocation solutions in PMSVD-assisted optical MIMO systems with layer-based zero-forcing equalization are investigated. As shown by our computer simulations and testbed measurements, optimal power allocation (PA) leads to the best BERs at the cost of a high complexity compared to suboptimal PA solutions. However, as highlighted by our simulation results, suboptimal PA schemes seem to be a good alternative for achieving nearly optimum bit-error rate (BER) at a significantly lower complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8233042/8233211/08233253.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)","doi":"10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233211","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation in Zero-Forcing Assisted PMSVD-based Optical MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Resource management","Optical signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Optical coupling","Optical devices","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","singular value decomposition","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SISO layers","layer-based zero-forcing equalization","zero-forcing assisted PMSVD-based optical MIMO systems","single-input single-output systems","spatio-temporal vector coding","polynomial matrix singular value decomposition","PMSVD-assisted optical MIMO systems","frequency-selective characteristic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation in Zero-Forcing Assisted PMSVD-based Optical MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233253/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452277","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation in Zero-Forcing Assisted PMSVD-based Optical MIMO Systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1204588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066875S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8233042","isNumber":"8233211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8233042","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8233211","articleId":"8233253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8233254,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Herbert","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Herbert","id":"38229757200"},{"name":"James R.

Focusing on discrete variable QKD and adopting the low data rates consistent with measured entanglement distribution from space, we quantify the benefits of state-of-the-art short- block length codes in the context of device- independent QKD. Our results highlight the trade- off between the attainable key throughput vs the communication latency encountered in space-based implementations of this ultra-secure technology.","doi":"10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233263","publicationTitle":"2017 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence Conference (SSPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8233042/8233211/08233263.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSPD.2017.8233263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short Codes and Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution via Satellite","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233263/","displayDocTitle":"Short Codes and Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution via Satellite","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17419219","htmlLink":"/document/8233263/","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short Codes and Entanglement-Based Quantum Key Distribution via Satellite","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1204892.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063499S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8233042","isNumber":"8233211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8233042","xplore-issue":"8233211","articleId":"8233263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8233402,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Geng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8323433/8233402/geng-2777868-small.gif","p":["Jie Geng received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and Communication Engineering.","His research interests include SAR image classification and deep learning."]},"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Geng","orcid":"0000-0003-4858-823X","id":"37085730785"},{"name":"Hongyu Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8323433/8233402/wang-2777868-small.gif","p":["Hongyu Wang (M\u201902) received the B.S. degree from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 1990, the M.S. degree from the Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in precision instrument and optoelectronics engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1997.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

With the advancement of imaging techniques, it permits to produce higher resolution SAR data and extend data amount. Therefore, intelligent algorithms for high-resolution SAR image classification are demanded. Inspired by deep learning technology, an end-to-end classification model from the original SAR image to final classification map is developed to automatically extract features and conduct classification, which is named deep recurrent encoding neural networks (DRENNs). In our proposed framework, a spatial feature learning network based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) is developed to extract contextual dependencies of SAR images, where 2-D image patches are transformed into 1-D sequences and imported into LSTM to learn the latent spatial correlations. After LSTM, nonnegative and Fisher constrained autoencoders (NFCAEs) are proposed to improve the discrimination of features and conduct final classification, where nonnegative constraint and Fisher constraint are developed in each autoencoder to restrict the training of the network. The whole DRENN not only combines the spatial feature learning power of LSTM but also utilizes the discriminative representation ability of our NFCAE to improve the classification performance. The experimental results tested on three SAR images demonstrate that the proposed DRENN is able to learn effective feature representations from SAR images and produce competitive classification accuracies to other related approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17649914","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8233402/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SAR Image Classification via Deep Recurrent Encoding Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFC1401007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671103"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17RC(3)024"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of High Resolution Special Research","grantNumber":"41-Y30B12-9001-14/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Image Classification via Deep Recurrent Encoding Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tgrs-geng-2777868-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101063S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8323433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8323433","articleId":"8233402","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":8233403,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8334663/8233403/wang-2779539-small.gif","p":["Yao Wang received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from\n Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014.","He was a Visiting Student at the Georgia Institute of Technology from Oct. 2010 to Nov. 2011.

In this paper, we present a novel tensor-based HSI restoration approach by fully identifying the intrinsic structures of the clean HSI part and the mixed noise part. Specifically, for the clean HSI part, we use tensor Tucker decomposition to describe the global correlation among all bands, and an anisotropic spatial-spectral total variation regularization to characterize the piecewise smooth structure in both spatial and spectral domains. For the mixed noise part, we adopt the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm regularization to detect the sparse noise, including stripes, impulse noise, and dead pixels. Despite that TV regularization has the ability of removing Gaussian noise, the Frobenius norm term is further used to model heavy Gaussian noise for some real-world scenarios. Then, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem by using the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. Finally, extensive experiments on simulated and real-world noisy HSIs are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art ones.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Total Variation Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2779539","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8334663/08233403.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2779539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334663","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Total Variation Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8233403/","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17684521","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11501440, 61603292, 61673015, 61373114, 61402082 and 61772003"},{"fundingName":"Vice-Chancellor's Discretionary Fund of the Chinese University of Hong Kong"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Restoration Via Total Variation Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition","sourcePdf":"jstars-wang-2779539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10976S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8334663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"8334663","articleId":"8233403","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8233404,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel H.

A cryogenic preamplifier operated at 77 K is designed and implemented for 13 C imaging at 3 T (32.13 MHz), using off-the-shelves components. The design is based on a high electron mobility transistor (ATF54143) in a common source configuration. Required auxiliary circuitry for optimal cryogenic preamplifier performance is also presented consisting of a voltage regulator (noise free supply voltage and optimal power consumption), switch, and trigger (for active detuning during transmission to protect the preamplifier). A gain of 18 dB with a noise temperature of 13.7 K is achieved. Performing imaging experiments in a 3 T scanner showed an 8% increased signal-to-noise ratio from 365 to 399 when lowering the temperature of the preamplifier from 296 to 77 K while keeping the coil at room temperature. This paper thus enables the merger of cryogenic coils and preamplifiers in the hopes of reaching the ultimate limit of detection for MRI.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2776256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8269836/08233404.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"210","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2776256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryogenic Preamplifiers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic Preamplifiers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8233404/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17491350","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2018","pubMedId":"29377808","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011512","fundingName":"National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"DNRF124"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic Preamplifiers for Magnetic Resonance Imaging","sourcePdf":"tbcas-johansen-2776256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059969S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8269836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8269836","articleId":"8233404","onlineDate":"21 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8233406,"authors":[{"name":"Narendra Parihar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Narendra","lastName":"Parihar","orcid":"0000-0003-3191-0333","id":"37085741388"},{"name":"Nilesh Goel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Nilesh","lastName":"Goel","orcid":"0000-0001-8406-7867","id":"38552389600"},{"name":"Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Subhadeep","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","orcid":"0000-0002-4976-0575","id":"38466191600"},{"name":"Souvik Mahapatra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Souvik","lastName":"Mahapatra","id":"37272724100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"8233406","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1704},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"A comprehensive modeling framework is presented to predict the time kinetics of negative bias temperature instability stress and recovery during and after dc and ac stresses and also during mixed dc-ac stress.

Specifically, we generalize single-linear component design approaches, which modify the Rayleigh-distributed OFDM signal amplitude tail, to use of multiple contiguous piecewise linear components. The new compander design approach defines and solves a constrained optimization problem to optimally perturb a given proposed multicomponent piecewise linear segment set to meet the power and probability density function constraints. The use of multiple piecewise linear components provides greater design flexibility to meet the constraints, thus providing solutions for pairs of inflection points and cutoff values where more rigidly designed companders fail to exist.

We implement this as a loss layer regularizer, where the ground truth labels are combined with crowdsourced labels in order to construct a noisy output distribution during training. We use a label disturbance method in which training examples are randomly replaced with incorrect labels drawn from the combined label probability distribution. We compare the performance of our disturbed and undisturbed models in cross-validation testing on the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset and cross-dataset experiments on the MMI, JAFFE, and FER2013 datasets. We find that using our proposed method, test performance is improved on both the MMI and JAFFE datasets.

The task is to predict whether or not a program contains semantic bugs. Previous studies apply conventional machine learning techniques on software metrics, or deep learning on source code's tree representations called abstract syntax trees. This paper formulates an approach for software defect prediction, in which source code firstly is compiled into assembly code and then a multi-view convolutional neural network is applied to automatically learn defect features from the assembly instruction sequences. The experimental results on four real-world datasets indicate that exploiting assembly code is beneficial to detecting semantic bugs. Our approach significantly outperforms baselines that are based on software metrics and abstract syntax trees.","publicationTitle":"2017 21st Asia Pacific Symposium on Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems (IES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 21st Asia Pacific Symposium on Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems (IES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8199213/8233542/08233558.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IESYS.2017.8233558","doi":"10.1109/IESYS.2017.8233558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional neural networks on assembly code for predicting software defects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional neural networks on assembly code for predicting software defects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233558/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8233558/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452689","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional neural networks on assembly code for predicting software defects","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"07paper13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075705S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8199213","isNumber":"8233542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8199213","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8233542","articleId":"8233558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8233559,"authors":[{"name":"Toan Pham Van","affiliation":["Framgia Inc., R&D Group, Ha Noi"],"firstName":"Toan Pham","lastName":"Van","id":"37086314549"},{"name":"Ta Minh Thanh","affiliation":["Dept. of Network Technology, Le Quy Don Technical University, Ha Noi"],"firstName":"Ta Minh","lastName":"Thanh","id":"37086313222"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0743-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1899-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8233559","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"Nowadays, text classification (TC) becomes the main applications of NLP (natural language processing). Actually, we have a lot of researches in classifying text documents, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes. However, most of them are applied for English documents. Therefore, the text classification researches on Vietnamese still are limited. By using a Vietnamese news corpus, we propose some methods to solve Vietnamese news classification problems. By employing the Bag of Words (BoW) with keywords extraction and Neural Network approaches, we trained a machine learning model that could achieve an average of \u2248 99.75% accuracy.

In addition, taking advantage of the development in Natural Language Processing field, we use some methods such as n-gram, doc2vec (or Paragraph vectors), TF-IDF to convert those API sequences to numeric vectors before feeding to the classifiers. Our proposed approaches are divided into 3 different methods to classify malware, that is TF-IDF, Paragraph Vector with Distributed Bag of Words and Paragraph Vector with Distributed Memory.

In this paper, we present deep learning based approaches to solve two problems in skin lesion analysis using a dermoscopic image containing skin tumor. In the first problem, we use a fully convolutional-deconvolutional architecture to automatically segment skin tumor from the surrounding skin. In the second problem, we use a simple convolutional neural network and VGG-16 architecture using transfer learning to address the two different tasks in skin tumor classification. The proposed models are trained and evaluated on standard benchmark datasets from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2017 Challenge, which consists of 2000 training samples and 600 testing samples. The result shows that the proposed methods achieve promising performances. In the first problem, the average value of Jaccard index for lesion segmentation using fully convolutional-deconvolutional architecture is 0.507. In the second problem, the values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on two different lesion classifications using VGG16 with transfer learning are 0.763 and 0.869, respectively; the average value of AUC in two tasks is 0.816.","doi":"10.1109/IESYS.2017.8233570","publicationTitle":"2017 21st Asia Pacific Symposium on Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems (IES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 21st Asia Pacific Symposium on Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems (IES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8199213/8233542/08233570.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IESYS.2017.8233570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233542","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233570/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452688","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8233570/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic skin lesion analysis towards melanoma detection","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"19paper41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059814S","chronDate":"15-17 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8199213","isNumber":"8233542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8199213","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8233542","articleId":"8233570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8233571,"authors":[{"name":"Yudai Hirama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yudai","lastName":"Hirama","id":"37086330675"},{"name":"Soichiro Yokoyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Soichiro","lastName":"Yokoyama","id":"37086308845"},{"name":"Tomohisa Yamashita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohisa","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37086307093"},{"name":"Hidenori Kawamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidenori","lastName":"Kawamura","id":"37285306200"},{"name":"Keiji Suzuki","affiliation":["Complex School of Information, Future University Hakodate, Hakodate, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37086334844"},{"name":"Masaaki Wada","affiliation":["School of Systems Information Science, Future University Hakodate, Hakodate, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Wada","id":"37406059700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0743-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1899-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8233571","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminating fish species by an Echo sounder in a set-net using a CNN","abstract":"Currently, the prediction of fish species and catches is based on the experience of fishermen.

As a result, Fog computing is a new paradigm that entitle cloud computing and services to meets the enhanced communications requirements of low latency, location awareness and mobility support. The Fog computing is located just one wireless hop away from associated end nodes, such as mobile devices, sensors and end users. Services are hosted at the edge of network, consequently, this reduces service latency, improves quality of service and provides a superior experience for end users. Hence, Fog computing paradigm offers ideal placement for low-latency offload infrastructure to support emerging applications that demand real-time or predictable latency, such as vehicle automation, augmented reality and wearable cognitive assistance.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233645","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233645.pdf","startPage":"iii","endPage":"iv","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Services and communications in fog computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Services and communications in fog computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233645/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Services and communications in fog computing","sourcePdf":"guesteditorial201711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023834S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8233645","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8233646,"authors":[{"name":"Shuqing He","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Shuqing","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Bo Cheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Haifeng Wang","affiliation":["Linyi University, Linyi, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yuze Huang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yuze","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Junliang Chen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Junliang","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233646","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":766},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Computer architecture","Intelligent sensors","Cloud computing","Real-time systems","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","health care","Internet of Things","parallel processing","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical sensors","complex event processing","data stream processing","hierarchical fog-cloud computing CEP architecture","personalized service","sensor layer","fog layer","cloud layer","healthcare application","proactive personalized services","elder living","patient living","FogCepCare","IoT-based healthcare application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["personalized services","fog computing","complex event pattern","IoT-based healthcare application"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233646","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233646.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233646","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","publicationTitle":"China Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive personalized services through fog-cloud computing in large-scale IoT-based healthcare application","abstract":"With the development of medical sensors and IoT, personalized service assisted elder and patient living is a critical service in IoT-based healthcare application.

Moreover, traditional recommendation methods easily suffer from the high dimensional problem and cold-start problem. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a PBUED (PLSA-Based Uniform Euclidean Distance) scheme, which utilizes topic model and uniform Euclidean distance to recommend the suitable items for users. The solution first employs probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) to extract users' interests, users with different interests are divided into different subgroups. Then, the uniform Euclidean distance is adopted to compute the users' similarity in the same interest subset; finally, the missing rating values of data are predicted via aggregating similar neighbors' ratings. We evaluate PBUED on two datasets and experimental results show PBUED can lead to better predicting performance and ranking performance than other approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17452380","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing collaborative filtering via topic model integrated uniform euclidean distance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing collaborative filtering via topic model integrated uniform euclidean distance","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031103S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8233650","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233651,"authors":[{"name":"Qiliang Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou 450046, China"],"firstName":"Qiliang","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Baojiang Si","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou 450046, China"],"firstName":"Baojiang","lastName":"Si"},{"name":"Feifan Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou 450046, China"],"firstName":"Feifan","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"You Ma","affiliation":["National Satellite Meteorological Center, Beijing 100081, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Ma"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233651","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1020},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233651","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Edge computing","Mobile communication","Energy consumption","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","energy consumption","mobile computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","mobile device","task offloading decision","fog computing system","cloud computing","mobile application","cloud servers","data transfer","task execution","fog computing environment","fog computing model","mobile user","remote cloud nodes","local cloud nodes","task offloading policy","computation performance","wireless access infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fog computing","task offloading","energy consumption","execution time"]}],"abstract":"Fog computing is an emerging paradigm of cloud computing which to meet the growing computation demand of mobile application.

Motivated by fog computing, which focuses on how to effectively offload computation-intensive tasks from resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a simple but yet effective data acquisition approach with the ability of filtering abnormal data and meeting the real-time requirement. Our method uses a cooperation mechanism by leveraging on both an architectural and algorithmic approach. Firstly, the sensor node with the limited computing resource only accomplishes detecting and marking the suspicious data using a light weight algorithm. Secondly, the cluster head evaluates suspicious data by referring to the data from the other sensor nodes in the same cluster and discard the abnormal data directly. Thirdly, the sink node fills up the discarded data with an approximate value using nearest neighbor data supplement method. Through the architecture, each node only consumes a few computational resources and distributes the heavily computing load to several nodes. Simulation results show that our data acquisition method is effective considering the real-time outlier filtering and the computing overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17452372","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fog computing architecture-based data acquisition for WSN applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fog computing architecture-based data acquisition for WSN applications","sourcePdf":"7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048426S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8233652","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8233653,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Chang'an University, Xian, Shanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Wei Luo","affiliation":["Shaanxi Fenghuo Communication Group Co., LTD, Baoji 721000, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Luo"},{"name":"Wei Liang","affiliation":["Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liang"},{"name":"Xiangyang Liu","affiliation":["Xi'an Communications Institute, Xi'an 710106, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Xiaodai Dong","affiliation":["Chang'an University, Xian, Shanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaodai","lastName":"Dong"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233653","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Bandwidth","Cloud computing","Encoding","Distributed databases","Systematics","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","codes","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally minimum storage regenerating codes","distributed cloud storage systems","multiple failed nodes","storage nodes","LMSR codes","storage overhead","MSR codes","multiple local groups","disk I/O overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed cloud storage systems","minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes","locally repairable codes (LRC)","repair bandwidth overhead","disk I/O overhead"]}],"abstract":"In distributed cloud storage systems, inevitably there exist multiple node failures at the same time.

Specifically, the nodes in distributed cloud storage systems are divided into multiple local groups, and in each local group (4, 2) or (5, 3) MSR codes are constructed. Moreover, the grouping method of storage nodes and the repairing process of failed nodes in local groups are studied. Theoretical analysis shows that LMSR codes can achieve the same storage overhead as MSR codes. Furthermore, we verify by means of simulation that, compared with MSR codes, LMSR codes can reduce the repair bandwidth and disk I/O overhead effectively.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233653","startPage":"82","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233653.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally minimum storage regenerating codes in distributed cloud storage systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Locally minimum storage regenerating codes in distributed cloud storage systems","volume":"14","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17452383","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally minimum storage regenerating codes in distributed cloud storage systems","sourcePdf":"8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050177S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8233653","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8233654,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Wang","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, TW"],"firstName":"Chao-Kai","lastName":"Wen"},{"name":"Hanqing Wang","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233654","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":194,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233654","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Computer architecture","Wireless communication","Physical layer","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","encoding","learning (artificial intelligence)","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","expressive capacity","convenient optimization capability","future communications","unknown channel models","accurate processing requirements","conventional communication theories","DL-based physical layer processing","conventional communication system","channel decoding","implementation research","deep learning","wireless physical layer","machine learning","upper layers","wireless communication systems","cognitive radio","communication network","sophisticated channel environments","limited learning ability","conventional ML algorithms","computer vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless communications","deep learning","physical layer"]}],"abstract":"Machine learning (ML) has been widely applied to the upper layers of wireless communication systems for various purposes, such as deployment of cognitive radio and communication network. However, its application to the physical layer is hampered by sophisticated channel environments and limited learning ability of conventional ML algorithms. Deep learning (DL) has been recently applied for many fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing, given its expressive capacity and convenient optimization capability. The potential application of DL to the physical layer has also been increasingly recognized because of the new features for future communications, such as complex scenarios with unknown channel models, high speed and accurate processing requirements; these features challenge conventional communication theories. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the emerging studies on DL-based physical layer processing, including leveraging DL to redesign a module of the conventional communication system (for modulation recognition, channel decoding, and detection) and replace the communication system with a radically new architecture based on an autoencoder. These DL-based methods show promising performance improvements but have certain limitations, such as lack of solid analytical tools and use of architectures that are specifically designed for communication and implementation research, thereby motivating future research in this field.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233654","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233654.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning for wireless physical layer: Opportunities and challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning for wireless physical layer: Opportunities and challenges","volume":"14","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452373","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233654/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning for wireless physical layer: Opportunities and challenges","sourcePdf":"9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040249S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"194","articleId":"8233654","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233655,"authors":[{"name":"Qiliang Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing 100084, China; Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an 710051, China"],"firstName":"Qiliang","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Qing Sun","affiliation":["Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Xiaobo Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Radar antennas","Radar","Delay effects","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","digital radio","jamming","Monte Carlo methods","object detection","probability","radar antennas","radar cross-sections","radar detection","radar signal processing","Rayleigh channels","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise power","constant filter modulus constraint","optimal filter coefficients","target detection probability","distributed dual antennas radar system","target echo","self-screen jamming","digital radio frequency memory technique","spatial filter","signal power","time-frequency domain","spatial-frequency domain","Rayleigh quotient approach","Monte Carlo simulations","computation complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["self-screen jamming","target correlation coefficient","distributed dual antennas","optimal filter","target detection"]}],"abstract":"Detecting target echo in the existence of self-screen jamming is a challenging work for radar system, especially when digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) technique is employed that mixes the jamming and target echo both in spatial and time-frequency domain. The conventional way to solve this problem would suffer from performance degradation when physical target (PT) and false target (FT) are superposed in time. In this paper, we propose a new spatial filter according to the different correlation characteristic between PT and FT. The filter takes the ratio of expected signal power to expected jamming and noise power as the objective function under the constant filter modulus constraint. The optimal filter coefficients are derived with a generalized rayleigh quotient approach. Moreover, we analytically compute the target detection probability and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method to the correlation coefficient. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to corroborate the proposed studies. Furthermore, the proposed method has simple architecture and low computation complexity, making it easily applied in modern radar system.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233655","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233655.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single source self-screen jamming elimination and target detection for distributed dual antennas radar system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Single source self-screen jamming elimination and target detection for distributed dual antennas radar system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233655/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17452374","volume":"14","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single source self-screen jamming elimination and target detection for distributed dual antennas radar system","sourcePdf":"10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022881S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8233655","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233656,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Yang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Ruimin Hu","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Ruimin","lastName":"Hu"},{"name":"Xiaochen Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaochen","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yuhong Yang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Yuhong","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Maosheng Zhang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Maosheng","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233656","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Audio coding","Feature extraction","Azimuth","Quantization (signal)","Microphones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D audio coding approach","spatial perception features","three-dimensional audio coding approach","spatial perceptual quality","nonuniform perceptual quantization","human auditory system","concentric spheres spatial quantization method","distance perceptual quality","distance side information comparing","directional audio coding","coding method","spatial squeeze surround audio coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D audio coding","non-uniform perceptual quantization","distance perceptual quality"]}],"abstract":"A new three-dimensional (3D) audio coding approach is presented to improve the spatial perceptual quality of 3D audio.

It conveys additional information on the subcarrier indices by activating specific subcarriers in the frequency domain besides the conventional amplitude-phase modulation of the activated subcarriers. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with IM (OFDM-IM) is deeply compared with the classical OFDM. It leads to an attractive trade-off between the spectral efficiency (SE) and the energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, the concept of the combinatorial modulation is introduced from a new point of view. The sparsity mapping is suggested intentionally to enable the compressive sensing (CS) concept in the data recovery process to provide further performance and EE enhancement without SE loss. Generating artificial data sparsity in the frequency domain along with naturally embedded channel sparsity in the time domain allows joint data recovery and channel estimation in a double sparsity framework. Based on simulation results, the performance of the proposed approach agrees with the predicted CS superiority even under low signal-to-noise ratio without channel coding. Moreover, the proposed sparsely indexed modulation system outperforms the conventional OFDM system and the OFDM-IM system in terms of error performance, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and energy efficiency under the same spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233658","startPage":"151","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233658.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing approach in multicarrier sparsely indexing modulation systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing approach in multicarrier sparsely indexing modulation systems","volume":"14","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17452375","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing approach in multicarrier sparsely indexing modulation systems","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020509S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8233658","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233659,"authors":[{"name":"Senjie Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Senjie","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Yuyang Wang","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US"],"firstName":"Yuyang","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233659","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Antennas","Interference","Cellular networks","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO communication","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","MIMO communication","mobile radio","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic rate analysis","device-to-device communications","cost efficient scheme","achievable rate performance","multiple-antenna base station","antenna selection scheme","ergodic achievable rate","larger-scale antenna systems","cellular UE","antenna number","cellular networks","D2D communication","spectrum reuse","spectral efficiency","D2D systems","Jensen's inequality","upper bounds","lower bounds","noise-limited scenario","interference-limited high SNR scenario","D2D interference management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna selection","D2D communication","ergodic achievable rate","Jensen's inequality","massive MIMO"]}],"abstract":"By reusing the spectrum of a cellular network, device-to-device (D2D) communications is known to greatly improve the spectral efficiency bypassing the base station (BS) of the cellular network.

This paper investigates the achievable rate performance of the D2D communication underlaying the cellular network where a multiple-antenna base station with antenna selection scheme is deployed. We derive an exact closed-form expression of the ergodic achievable rate. Also, using Jensen's inequality, two pairs of upper and lower bounds of the rate are derived and we validate the tightness of the two sets of bounds. Based on the bounds obtained, we analyze the ergodic achievable rate in noise-limited scenario, interference-limited high SNR scenario and larger-scale antenna systems. Our analysis shows that the presence of D2D users could be counter-productive if the SNR at cellular UE is high. Further analysis shows that the relationship between the ergodic rate and the number of antennas it positive, but keeps decreasing as the antenna number increasing. These show the inefficiency of antenna selection in D2D interference management.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233659","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233659.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic rate analysis on applying antenna selection in D2D communication underlaying cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic rate analysis on applying antenna selection in D2D communication underlaying cellular networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233659/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17482229","volume":"14","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic rate analysis on applying antenna selection in D2D communication underlaying cellular networks","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02815S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8233659","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233660,"authors":[{"name":"Vishakha Ramani","affiliation":["University Institute of Technology Thiruvananthapuram, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"Vishakha","lastName":"Ramani"},{"name":"Sanjay K.

Since, most of the spectrum is underutilized, it motivated the introduction of the concept of cognitive radios, a dynamic spectrum access enabling technology. The first stage of cognitive radio is to sense the environment and determine which parts of the spectrum are available. This is achieved through spectrum sensing. However, spectrum sensing poses the most fundamental challenge in cognitive radios.

However, it can suffer from data sparsity issue in cases where the systems do not have sufficient domain information. Transfer learning, which enables information to be transferred from source domains to target domain, presents an unprecedented opportunity to alleviate this issue. A few recent works focus on transferring user-item rating information from a dense domain to a sparse target domain, while almost all methods need that each rating matrix in source domain to be extracted should be complete. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel multiple incomplete domains transfer learning model for cross-domain collaborative filtering. The transfer learning process consists of two steps. First, the user-item ratings information in incomplete source domains are compressed into multiple informative compact cluster-level matrixes, which are referred as codebooks. Second, we reconstruct the target matrix based on the codebooks. Specifically, for the purpose of maximizing the knowledge transfer, we design a new algorithm to learn the rating knowledge efficiently from multiple incomplete domains. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17452370","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MINDTL: Multiple incomplete domains transfer learning for information recommendation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MINDTL: Multiple incomplete domains transfer learning for information recommendation","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046353S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8233662","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8233663,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

The polynomial interpolation by Lagrange and curve fitting requires high computational efforts for higher order polynomials and moreover they are susceptible to Runge's phenomenon. The Chebyshev polynomials are secure, accurate, and stable and there is no limit to the degree of the polynomials. The distributed key management is a big challenge in these time varying networks. In this work, the Chebyshev polynomials are used to perform key management and tested in various conditions. The secret key shares generation, symmetric key construction and key distribution by using Chebyshev polynomials are the main elements of this projected work. The significance property of Chebyshev polynomials is its recursive nature. The mobile nodes usually have less computational power and less memory, the key management by using Chebyshev polynomials reduces the burden of mobile nodes to implement the overall system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17452379","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Key management using Chebyshev polynomials for mobile ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key management using Chebyshev polynomials for mobile ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03086S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8233663","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8233664,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Peng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Peng"},{"name":"Guanyu Su","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Guanyu","lastName":"Su"},{"name":"Bin Tian","affiliation":["China Information Technology Security Evaluation Center, No 1 Building, No 8 Shangdixi Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100085, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Tian"},{"name":"Maohua Sun","affiliation":["Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Maohua","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Qi Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Li"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233664","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233664","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Androids","Humanoid robots","Mobile communication","Software","Smart phones","Access control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","graph theory","mobile computing","program diagnostics","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android code protection","irrelevant code","opaque predicates","access control strategy","mobile intelligent terminals","mobile applications","malicious code","counterfeit apps","code obfuscation techniques","code security protection","control flow obfuscation","control flow flattening","graph traversal problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["control flow obfuscation control flow obfuscation","software security"]}],"abstract":"With the popularization and rapid development of mobile intelligent terminals (MITs), the number of mobile applications, or apps, has increased exponentially.

First, algorithms to insert irrelevant code and flatten the control flow are employed that minimize the cost of obfuscation while ensuring its strength. Second, we improve the traditional methods of control flow flattening to further reduce the costs of obfuscation. Lastly, the use of opaque predicates is strengthened by establishing an access control strategy, which converts the identification of opaque predicates in the entire program into a graph traversal problem, and thereby increases the strength of the code protection. We did some experiments to evaluate our method, and the results show that the proposed method can work well.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233664","startPage":"247","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233664.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control flow obfuscation based protection method for Android applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Control flow obfuscation based protection method for Android applications","volume":"14","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17452385","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control flow obfuscation based protection method for Android applications","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028663S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8233664","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233665,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Tong","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Tong"},{"name":"Yiting Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yiting","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Fan Wen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wen"},{"name":"Xiaowen Li","affiliation":["China Mobile Communications Co., Ltd.

First, this paper finds some driven forces of customer loyalty, which are relative to customer consumption such as the call duration, the usage of data, ARPU, etc., by using some innovative reasoning-analysis based on IG (Information Gain) and xg-boost decision-making tree model, so the tele-companies can predict the role of individual customer and form daily monitoring on big data, which will save a lot of NPS survey cost.

During the SCR procedure, only the element with the maximal amplitude is picked for processing, which not only decreases the algorithm complexity, but also helps to overcome the BER deterioration. With the LSA method, the amplitude of the peak-cancelling signals can approximate to that of the original clipping noise as much as possible. Through the combination of the optimization factor in the LSA method, the classic SCR method can achieve better PAPR reduction with faster convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed SCR-LSA TR scheme has less in-band distortion and smaller out-of-band spectral radiation. The BER of the proposed scheme shows a better performance especially under the 16-QAM over the additive white Gaussian noise channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"17452376","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel peak-to-average power ratio reduction scheme via tone reservation in OFDM systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel peak-to-average power ratio reduction scheme via tone reservation in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03178S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8233667","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8233668,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233668","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"abstract":"Presents information on the editorial board for this issue of the publication.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233668","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233668.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"China communications editorial board meeting 2017 held in Qingdao","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","displayDocTitle":"China communications editorial board meeting 2017 held in Qingdao","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233668/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"China communications editorial board meeting 2017 held in Qingdao","sourcePdf":"News201711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.010279S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8233668","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233669,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8233669","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233669","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8233642/08233669.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2017.8233669","doi":"10.1109/CC.2017.8233669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233642","publicationTitle":"China Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call for papers","abstract":"\"Prospective authors are requested to submit new, unpublished manuscripts for inclusion in the upcoming event described in this call for papers.\"","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","volume":"14","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Call for papers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call for papers","sourcePdf":"CFP201711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016247S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","isNumber":"8233642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8233669","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8233790,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this work, a liquid cooling device based on a matrix of microfluidic cells is presented. The coolant flow rate in each microfluidic cell is individually tailored, through thermally activated microvalves, to the local heat extraction needs in order to improve the temperature uniformity and avoid overcooling. A numerical study is implemented to assess the thermo-hydraulic performance of the cooling device. The analysis is performed in a steady state CFD study and integrated along a time dependent and non-uniform heat load scenario.

To analyse the temperature dependent behaviour, functional-thermal co-simulation can be performed. We are developing a framework called LogiTherm which can be used to perform such simulation of digital and mixed signal circuits on different abstraction levels. The framework utilizes the so-called simulator coupling technique to connect the thermal and functional domain. Multiple thermal simulator engines are integrated into our system (e.g. 3D-ICE, HotSpot, SUNRED), but their implementation is not efficient on modern computer architectures, thus the simulation speed can be limited. In this paper, we describe a new thermal model and a simulator engine designed for multicore processors and GPUs to enable more detailed simulation. A new, adaptive co-simulation strategy is also described, which can further reduce the computational overhead of the thermal simulations.","doi":"10.1109/THERMINIC.2017.8233823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THERMINIC.2017.8233823","publicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems (THERMINIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 23rd International Workshop on Thermal Investigations of ICs and Systems (THERMINIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8206642/8233782/08233823.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive co-simulation of functional-thermal behaviour of integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive co-simulation of functional-thermal behaviour of integrated circuits","conferenceDate":"27-29 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467601","htmlLink":"/document/8233823/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive co-simulation of functional-thermal behaviour of integrated circuits","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"73174Poppeetal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070963S","chronDate":"27-29 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8206642","isNumber":"8233782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8206642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8233782","articleId":"8233823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8233868,"authors":[{"name":"Milind Pandit","affiliation":["Nanoscience Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Milind","lastName":"Pandit","id":"37086121913"},{"name":"Chun Zhao","affiliation":["Nanoscience Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085449016"},{"name":"Guillermo Sobreviela","affiliation":["Nanoscience Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Sobreviela","id":"37085342471"},{"name":"Arif Mustafazade","affiliation":["Nanoscience Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Mustafazade","id":"37086328133"},{"name":"Ashwin A Seshia","affiliation":["Nanoscience Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Ashwin A","lastName":"Seshia","id":"37400656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1012-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1013-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8233868","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8233868","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonators","Sensors","Vibrations","Perturbation methods","Micromechanical devices","Frequency measurement","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mass measurement","micromechanical devices","microsensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude ratio dependence","amplitude ratio measurements","power variations","veering zone","resonators","high resolution long term measurements","mode localized resonant MEMS sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MEMS","Mode localization","Resonators","Veering","Resolution"]}],"abstract":"For the first time, this paper highlights the dependence of amplitude ratio on the drive power in mode localized sensors.

EIT-based sensors are low-cost, can be applied over 3D surfaces, and show multi-touch sensing capabilities, but their drawback is their low spatial resolution. In this paper we propose to solve the EIT reconstruction problem with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). We present our study using a Finite Element (FE) model of our EIT-based sensor. Results using different target dimensions show that the ANN can learn to reconstruct the target placement over the skin. This is performed with an improved detected size of the objet and position accuracy for small objects of up to 37% and 14.7% respectively and 4.3% and 15.2% for larger objects. By improving the performance of the EIT-based sensitive skin through ANNs, we want to contribute to the literature by surmounting their major limitations that so far have been hindering their integration in several applications. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one introducing ANNs for target placement recognition in EIT-based sensitive skins.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8233910/","accessionNumber":"17452424","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8233910/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards a practical implementation of EIT-based sensors using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards a practical implementation of EIT-based sensors using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048286S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169642","isNumber":"8233862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8233862","articleId":"8233910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8233995,"authors":[{"name":"Jongpal Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jongpal","lastName":"Kim","id":"38185707900"},{"name":"Hankyu Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hankyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086263850"},{"name":"Sangjoon Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangjoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37069754400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1012-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1013-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8233995","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"abstract":"A novel concept instrumentation amplifier (IA) using an analog signal compression technique is suggested to achieve a large dynamic input range. A large analog input signal is segmented into a smaller analog signal to prevent saturating the analog output signal in the input stage of the IA.

Our design has two advantages compared to previous designs; i) no signal loss due to a reset operation, and ii) low current drivability of the reference bias circuit for low power consumption.

Usually, it is difficult to calibrate the fixed pattern noise of a bolometer array. The principle of the pixel current calibration technique is that the dark current of a reference pixel is subtracted from the dark current of each active pixel. To reduce the difference in current due to the pixel resistance variation, a suitable calibration current is required. Through this pixel current calibration technique, the dark current of the active pixel resistor, and subsequently, the fixed pattern noise, can be reduced significantly.

The developed models are verified by experiment results for a lateral-axis VWG with resonant frequency around 10kHz. It is the first time to find that in the lateral-axis VWG, with pressure decreasing, the main energy loss will transform from air damping to non-viscous energy dissipations (including thermal-elastic damping (TED), anchor loss, etc.) at the critical pressure points of 0.85Pa and 0.4Pa, in drive and sense modes respectively. The calculated Q-factors are within +/-15% of the measured value when non-viscous energy dissipation mechanisms are included.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8234141/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452456","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of air damping in different vibrational modes of lateral-axis gyroscopes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of air damping in different vibrational modes of lateral-axis gyroscopes","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047645S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169642","isNumber":"8233862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169642","xplore-issue":"8233862","articleId":"8234141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8234158,"authors":[{"name":"Siho Shin","affiliation":["Dept. of IT Fusion Technology, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Siho","lastName":"Shin","id":"37086320848"},{"name":"Jaehyo Jung","affiliation":["Dept. of IT Fusion Technology, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehyo","lastName":"Jung","id":"38239709200"},{"name":"Youn Tae Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of IT Fusion Technology, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Youn Tae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539572000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1012-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1013-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8234158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":523},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234158","abstract":"The typical method of entering a password for user authentication is vulnerable to hacking; therefore, various security technologies using bio-signals, such as iris scan, electrocardiography, electromyography (EMG), and fingerprint recognition, are being developed.

To improve recognition, an artificial neural network clustering algorithm is employed in this study. It includes pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification.

This paper presents a 6-element concave microphone array designed for the VR/AR headset. Two key processing methods are developed: (1) beamforming technique to enhance the signal along the target speech direction, and (2) ICA blind source separation to separate mixed speech signals. These two methods are further integrated to improve each other's performance and to achieve an intelligent target speech enhancement scheme. Different speech interactions in VR/AR financial transactions are investigated with the smart microphone array. Simulation and experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed system can improve SNR and yield a smaller WER (word error rate) in speech recognition.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233862","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE SENSORS","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE SENSORS","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169642/8233862/08234178.pdf","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart microphone array design for speech enhancement in financial VR and AR","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234178","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Smart microphone array design for speech enhancement in financial VR and AR","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234178/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467327","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8234178/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart microphone array design for speech enhancement in financial VR and AR","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047928S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169642","isNumber":"8233862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169642","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8233862","articleId":"8234178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8234202,"authors":[{"name":"John Vaughan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Vaughan","id":"37956434700"},{"name":"Peter M Green","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Peter M","lastName":"Green","id":"38182016400"},{"name":"Michael Salter","affiliation":["AB Agri Ltd, Peterborough, PE2 6FL, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Salter","id":"37086328066"},{"name":"Bruce Grieve","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Grieve","id":"37296143500"},{"name":"Krikor B Ozanyan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Krikor B","lastName":"Ozanyan","id":"37282743500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1012-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1013-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8234202","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234202","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Animals","Optical fibers","Floors","Agriculture","Optical fiber sensors","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","farming","fibre optic sensors","intelligent sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","sensor fusion","weighing","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floor sensors","animal weight","precision livestock farming","smart sensor systems","plastic optical fiber transmission measurements","gait analysis","guided-path tomography images","weight estimation","pig farms","automatic data collection","deformation sensors","animal gait data","rubberized mat sensor heads","machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed sensing","hostile environment","sensor enclosure","animal weight estimation","big data","IoT"]}],"abstract":"We report first results on developing smart sensor systems for the automatic and frequent collection of animal weight and gait data, under the hostile conditions of a livestock farm.

differences in single and dual walking tasks from footprint floor sensor data","abstract":"Gait can provide insights of executive function decline. We present experiments and methodology for analysing age-sensitive differences in changes of walking patterns on 3 volunteers from three age groups: a young adult, an adult and a mature adult, by using an original footprint imaging floor sensor. The effect of cognitive load tasks in spatio-temporal walking patterns of the volunteers is captured in the experiments. Classification models based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied to raw gait sensor data activities, including single tasks, such as normal and fast walk, as well as dual tasks. For single tasks, we report classifications with a top F-score of 93.36 \u00b1 5.56. Competitive classification performance was obtained for the fine-grained walking variability in the dual task experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234299/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8234299/","accessionNumber":"17501896","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Age-sensitive differences in single and dual walking tasks from footprint floor sensor data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age-sensitive differences in single and dual walking tasks from footprint floor sensor data","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072658S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169642","isNumber":"8233862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169642","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8233862","articleId":"8234299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8234335,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Barriault","affiliation":["University of British, School of Engineering, Columbia Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Barriault","id":"37086294946"},{"name":"Mohammad Paknahad","affiliation":["University of British, School of Engineering, Columbia Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Paknahad","id":"38365341000"},{"name":"Allen O'Brien","affiliation":["University of British, School of Engineering, Columbia Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"Allen","lastName":"O'Brien","id":"37086273530"},{"name":"Homayoun Najjaran","affiliation":["University of British, School of Engineering, Columbia Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"Homayoun","lastName":"Najjaran","id":"37284326900"},{"name":"Mina Hoorfar","affiliation":["University of British, School of Engineering, Columbia Kelowna, Canada"],"firstName":"Mina","lastName":"Hoorfar","id":"37284335100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1012-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1013-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8234335","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234335","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gases","Time-frequency analysis","Surface contamination","Frequency measurement","Timing","Pollution measurement","Gas detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gas sensors","microfluidics","microsensors","MIS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerated regeneration","microfluidic gas sensor","MOS gas sensor","contaminant gases","regeneration time","vacuum pressure","microfluidic channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["regeneration","microfluidics","MOS","microchannel","sensor"]}],"abstract":"Regeneration of an MOS gas sensor refers to the process of removing contaminant gases from the surface of the sensor so that it can reach a baseline reading.

Theoretical power and misalignment models are investigated for a single static, light-emitting diode as transmission source, with optical lenses on both transmitting and receiving ends of the system. The maximum misalignment tolerance, while performing digital data communication, is discussed. It is shown that the trade-off between transmission distance and misalignment tolerance is largely determined by the focus level of the receiver lens, which can be controlled by the position of the receiver photodiode on the optical axis. While defocusing the receiver lens permits a larger misalignment tolerance, the signal strength and effective communication distance are decreased. The transmitter beam width is a limiting factor in finding the maximum misalignment tolerance by defocusing the receiver lens.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234360","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE SENSORS","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE SENSORS","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169642/8233862/08234360.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233862","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power optical communication modem for compact autonomous underwater vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-power optical communication modem for compact autonomous underwater vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234360/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452467","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8234360/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power optical communication modem for compact autonomous underwater vehicles","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079204S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169642","isNumber":"8233862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169642","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8233862","articleId":"8234360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8234364,"authors":[{"name":"Unghyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Unghyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086336784"},{"name":"Makoto Ikeda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37273902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1012-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1013-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8234364","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"abstract":"Three-dimensional range-finding systems are widely used in various applications and fields.

The proposed radio frequency (RF) system is composed of three different stages: (1) a piezoelectric resonator that provides for passive voltage amplification, impedance matching, and high-Q filtering; (2) a MEMS resonant demodulator that acts as an efficient envelope detector of the modulated RF signal; and (3) a low power trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) that amplifies the output current of the demodulator and triggers a latch rectifier. All the RF components except for the CMOS are passive, which drastically reduce the power required to detect the RF signature. The CMOS components are constrained to operate with a maximum power consumption of 10 nW, approximately equivalent to the leakage rate of a battery. We analyze the performance of the proposed system for input frequencies ranging between 50 MHz and 400 MHz, and a modulation frequency (equal to the frequency of the MEMS demodulator) of 20-100 kHz. Our investigation shows that by using high performance acoustic resonators based on thin-films of lithium niobate [1] operating around 100 MHz in conjunction with narrow-gap MEMS demodulators [2], our proposed RMR can attain a sensitivity of at least -80 dBm for a 50% OOK signal and consume only 10 nW.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2017.8234414","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE SENSORS","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169642/8233862/08234414.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE SENSORS","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-low-power and high sensitivity resonant micromechanical receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-low-power and high sensitivity resonant micromechanical receiver","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8234414/","accessionNumber":"17467284","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234414/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-low-power and high sensitivity resonant micromechanical receiver","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"1780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05191S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2017-Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169642","isNumber":"8233862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169642","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8233862","articleId":"8234414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8234415,"authors":[{"name":"Pouyan Bassirian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA"],"firstName":"Pouyan","lastName":"Bassirian","id":"37086153880"},{"name":"Jesse Moody","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA"],"firstName":"Jesse","lastName":"Moody","id":"37085995202"},{"name":"Anming Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Champaign, IL"],"firstName":"Anming","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085592908"},{"name":"Tom\u00e1s Manzaneque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Champaign, IL"],"firstName":"Tom\u00e1s","lastName":"Manzaneque","id":"38274692000"},{"name":"Benton H.

Bangla handwritten compound character recognition is a complex task that is challenging due to extensive size of and sheer diversity within the alphabet. The current work proposes a novel method of recognition of compound characters in Bangla language using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and efficient greedy layer-wise training approach. Introduction of dropout technology mitigates data overfitting and Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) is introduced to tackle the vanishing gradient problem during training. ELU is a special rectified linear unit which provides sustainability against the vanishing as well as exploding gradients. Furthermore, dropout influences network elements to learn diverse representation of data, which contributes to generalization of model. The model is tested on CMATERdb 3.1.3.3 data set of compound characters, and the performance is found to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods of Bangla handwritten complex character recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452765","htmlLink":"/document/8234497/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient method for improving classification accuracy of handwritten Bangla compound characters using DCNN with dropout and ELU","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient method for improving classification accuracy of handwritten Bangla compound characters using DCNN with dropout and ELU","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"paper27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050634S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8215442","isNumber":"8234465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8215442","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8234465","articleId":"8234497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8234499,"authors":[{"name":"Jayanta Datta","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer application, RCCIIT, Kolkata, INDIA"],"firstName":"Jayanta","lastName":"Datta","id":"37089041349"},{"name":"Indrajit Pan","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology, RCCIIT, Kolkata, INDIA"],"firstName":"Indrajit","lastName":"Pan","id":"38232128300"},{"name":"Siddhartha Bhattacharyya","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer application, RCCIIT, Kolkata, INDIA"],"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Bhattacharyya","id":"37420134000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1931-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1930-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1932-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8234499","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Standards","Load modeling","Quality of service","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud deployment models","service level agreement assessment model","WS-agreement","generic model","cloud client","cloud service provider","automated monitoring","Turing model","automated model","generic rule base","cloud service level agreement","cloud service providers","cloud services","diverse cloud deployments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["assessment","cloud computing","cloud service provider","cloud client","compliance","monitoring","service level agreement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234499","abstract":"Cloud services are gaining popularity with times.

This paper explores feature vectors from both the front and back side of a green leaf along with morphological features to arrive at a unique optimum combination of features that maximizes the identification rate. A database of medicinal plant leaves is created from scanned images of front and back side of leaves of commonly used ayurvedic medicinal plants. The leaves are classified based on the unique feature combination. Identification rates up to 99% have been obtained when tested over a wide spectrum of classifiers.

The advantages of the multiport pixel approach include enhanced harvested RF power for a given area as well as a reduction in the antenna matching requirements. We formulate the design of the triple-port pixel antenna as a binary optimization problem with an objective function related to harvested RF power in the GSM-1800 band for specified power angular spectrums without the need for antenna matching components. The optimization of the triple-port pixel antenna is obtained by using successive exhaustive Boolean optimization. The design for the triple-port rectifier with dc combining is also provided and a prototype is demonstrated. The rectenna measurement demonstrates that the proposed triple-port pixel antenna has dc output power over double that of single-port-based antennas of similar size. The overall RF-to-dc efficiency of the multiport pixel rectenna is also evaluated and shown to be 19% when the total input RF power is -20 dBm. The effects of nonuniformity in the input RF power across antenna ports are also investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

Such a wave possesses the fundamental characteristics of an OAM-carrying wave, i.e., a spiral phase distribution, yet propagates along transverse directions. Hence, it owes unique advantages for use in realizing desired radiation beams, while avoids the puzzles encountered by traditional OAM-carrying beams. Various OAM mode grouping using the superposition of PS-OAM waves are demonstrated here via theoretical calculations as well as experimental verifications. The generation methods for PS-OAM waves are also proposed and experimentally validated to authenticate the feasibility. Both the calculated and experimental results show that the PS-OAM grouping is capable of providing a practical realization of eigenmode beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2017.2786297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/8305571/08234566.pdf","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2017.2786297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8305571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of Beam Steering Based on Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum Wave","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234566/","displayDocTitle":"Realization of Beam Steering Based on Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum Wave","volume":"66","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17582433","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8234566/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB340005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571391 and 61371030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of Beam Steering Based on Plane Spiral Orbital Angular Momentum Wave","sourcePdf":"tap-zheng-2786297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066201S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"8305571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8305571","articleId":"8234566","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234570,"authors":[{"name":"Saroja Kanti Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/8353171/8234570/sahoo-2786588-small.gif","p":["Saroja Kanti Sahoo (S\u201915) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the College of Engineering and Technology, Bhubaneswar, India, in 2011, and the M.Tech. degree in power, control, and drives from the National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India, in 2013.

To investigate the tradeoff between energy consumption and latency, we present an energy-aware offloading scheme, which jointly optimizes communication and computation resource allocation under the limited energy and sensitive latency. In this paper, single and multicell MEC network scenarios are considered at the same time. The residual energy of smart devices' battery is introduced into the definition of the weighting factor of energy consumption and latency. In terms of the mixed integer nonlinear problem for computation offloading and resource allocation, we propose an iterative search algorithm combining interior penalty function with D.C. (the difference of two convex functions/sets) programming to find the optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain lower total cost (i.e., the weighted sum of energy consumption and execution latency) comparing with the baseline algorithms, and the energy-aware weighting factor is of great significance to maintain the lifetime of SMDs.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2786343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2786343","startPage":"2633","endPage":"2645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8430490/08234573.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Latency Tradeoff for Energy-Aware Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Latency Tradeoff for Energy-Aware Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Networks","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2018","accessionNumber":"18007993","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234573/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shenzhen-Hongkong Innovative Project","grantNumber":"SGLH20161212140718841"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory for 3-D Content Generating Technologies","grantNumber":"[2017]476"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Technology Project","grantNumber":"2016B010108010, 2016B010125003 and 2017B010110007"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB744600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403365, 61402458, 61502075, 61632014, 61601482 and 61772508"},{"fundingName":"Program of International S&T Cooperation of MOST","grantNumber":"2013DFA11140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Latency Tradeoff for Energy-Aware Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-ning-2786343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093537S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8430490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"8430490","articleId":"8234573","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234580,"authors":[{"name":"Hamza Baali","affiliation":["College of Science and Engineering, Hamad bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar","College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8277082/8234580/baali-2786301-small.gif","p":["Hamza Baali received the Ph.D. degree from the Intelligent Mechatronics Systems Research Unit, International Islamic University Malaysia in 2014.

A unique radio frequency identification tag with tilt and vibration sensors is used for each manhole cover, and a Narrowband Internet of Things is adopted for communication. Meanwhile, edge computing servers interact with corresponding management personnel through mobile devices based on the collected information. A demonstration application of the proposed IMCS in the Xiasha District of Hangzhou, China, showed its high efficiency.

To address the issue, we propose a new lightweight AHA scheme based on the number theory research unit public key cryptosystem for wireless networks.

The angular distributions of clusters in both the horizontal and vertical planes are jointly considered. The receiver and clusters can be moving, which makes the model more general. Parameters, including number of clusters, powers, delays, azimuth angles of departure (AAoDs), azimuth angles of arrival (AAoAs), elevation angles of departure (EAoDs), and elevation angles of arrival (EAoAs) are time-variant. The cluster time evolution is modeled using a birth-death process. Statistical properties, including spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), Doppler power spectrum density (PSD), level-crossing rate (LCR), average fading duration (AFD), and stationary interval are investigated and analyzed. The LCR, AFD, and stationary interval of the proposed channel model are validated against the measurement data. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed channel model has the ability to reproduce the main properties of real non-stationary channels. Furthermore, the proposed channel model can be adapted to various communication scenarios by adjusting different parameter values.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

approaches. Eight subjects were recruited for the recording of imagination with five different words, namely; \u201cgo,\u201d \u201cback,\u201d \u201cleft,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d and \u201cstop.\u201d Methods: One hundred trials for each word were recorded for both imagination and perception, although this study utilized only imagination data. Two different connectivity methods were applied, namely; a covariance-based and a maximum linear cross-correlation-based connectivity measure. These connectivity measures were further computed to extract the phase-only data as an additional method of feature extraction. In addition, four different channel selections were used. The final connectivity matrix from each of the four methods was vectorized and used as the feature vector for the classifier. To classify EEG data, a sigmoid activation function-based linear extreme learning machine was used. Result and Significance: We achieved a maximum classification rate of 40.30% (p <; 0.007) and 87.90% (p <; 0.003) in multiclass (five classes) and binary settings, respectively. Thus, our results suggested that EEG responses to imagined speech could be successfully classified using an extreme learning machine. Conclusion: This study involving the classification of imagined words can be a milestone contribution toward the development of practical brain-computer interface systems using silent speech.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2786251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8467387/08234615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2786251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8467387","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass Classification of Word Imagination Speech With Hybrid Connectivity Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass Classification of Word Imagination Speech With Hybrid Connectivity Features","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18128716","pubMedId":"29989953","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234615/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and ICT","grantNumber":"2017009068"},{"fundingName":"GIST Research Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass Classification of Word Imagination Speech With Hybrid Connectivity Features","sourcePdf":"tbme-lee-2786251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096838S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8467387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8467387","articleId":"8234615","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234621,"authors":[{"name":"Mahendra K.

In particular, by employing antenna selection at the relay, we propose beamforming and antenna selection transmission schemes at the BS with user scheduling in the presence of CEE and CCI. Then, we derive the tight closed-form lower bound expressions for the overall outage probability under Nakagami-m fading. We also deduce the asymptotic outage expressions in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, from which the impacts of CEE and CCI on the achievable diversity order are highlighted. Moreover, using the asymptotic expressions, three optimization problems to minimize the outage probability are formulated and solved: first, optimal power allocation (OPA) with fixed relay location. Specifically, we develop two OPA approaches, namely, OPA I and OPA II. OPA I allocates the total power appropriately at each terminal, whereas OPA II allocates the fixed half of the total power at the relay and remaining power to base station and users; second, optimal relay location with fixed power allocation; and third, jointly optimal power allocation and relay location. Our results reveal that the OPA I outperforms OPA II, irrespective of different channel/system parameters, interferers, and relay locations. In addition, we demonstrate that the effect of interferers at the relay can be ignored if we allocate sufficient power to the base station and users. It is also shown that the CEE and CCI can severely degrade the outage performance, and even reduce the diversity order to zero. Further, it is highlighted that the impact of CCI can be alleviated by increasing the number of relay antennas. The numerical and simulation results validate our analytical findings, and also demonstrate that the antenna selection scheme offers comparable outage performance as beamforming scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2786308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","startPage":"3431","endPage":"3446","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08234621.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2786308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular Multiuser Two-Way Relay Network With Cochannel Interference and Channel Estimation Error: Performance Analysis and Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Rayleigh channels","Resource management","Optimization","Antennas","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","channel estimation","cochannel interference","cooperative communication","diversity reception","Nakagami channels","optimisation","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","performance analysis","channel estimation error","CEE","BS","M single-antenna users","L-antenna relay","interferers","antenna selection transmission schemes","user scheduling","closed-form lower bound expressions","outage probability","asymptotic outage expressions","high signal-to-noise ratio regime","optimization problems","fixed relay location","optimal relay location","fixed power allocation","jointly optimal power allocation","relay antennas","antenna selection scheme","outage performance","cellular multiuser two-way relay network","channel-system parameters","Na-antenna base station","Nakagami-m fading","optimal power allocation","beamforming scheme","OPA II approach","OPA I approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relaying","co-channel interference","channel estimation error","power allocation","relay location"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Cellular Multiuser Two-Way Relay Network With Cochannel Interference and Channel Estimation Error: Performance Analysis and Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234621/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8234621/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17699029","publicationDate":"April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science & Engineering Research Board"},{"fundingName":"DST"},{"fundingName":"Government of India","grantNumber":"ECR/2017/000104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular Multiuser Two-Way Relay Network With Cochannel Interference and Channel Estimation Error: Performance Analysis and Optimization","sourcePdf":"tvt-yadav-2786308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138442S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8234621","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8234622,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel M.

To efficiently realize NOMA, we propose a framework combining the binary polar coding and the NOMA transmission, which adequately utilizes the reliability distinctions among users. In this polar-coded NOMA (PC-NOMA) system, the NOMA transmission is recognized from the novel perspective of channel polarization. Combing the binary polar coding and signal modulation, the original NOMA channel is decomposed into multiple bit polarized channels by using a three-stage channel transform, that is, user-+signal-+bit partitions. Specifically, for the first stage channel transform, we design two schemes, namely the sequential user partition and the parallel user partition (PUP). For the SUP based PC-NOMA system, a \u201cworst-goes-first\u201d strategy is proposed to determine the user partition order which improves the system performance by the enhanced polarization effect among the user synthesized channels. Also, its performance is analyzed by using the channel polarization principle. In the receiver, a joint successive cancellation detection and decoding scheme is developed. For the PUP based PC-NOMA system, a parallel detection scheme is exploited to reduce the processing latency. Furthermore, a round-robin user scheduling is given for the above two PC-NOMA systems, which ensures the user fairness over multiple data blocks. The block error ratio and throughput performances indicate that the proposed PC-NOMA systems obviously outperform the state-of-the-art turbo-coded NOMA systems due to the advantages ofjoint design between the polar coding and the NOMA transmission.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2786273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2786273","startPage":"1374","endPage":"1389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08234623.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar-Coded Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Polar-Coded Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","volume":"66","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17524204","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234623/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation","grantNumber":"CX2017306"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671080"},{"fundingName":"Qualcomm Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar-Coded Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"tsp-dai-2786273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132259S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8234623","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234625,"authors":[{"name":"Ge Chang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Chang"},{"name":"Lin Lin","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0002-9602-8977"},{"name":"Hao Yan","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0001-5441-9737"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1241"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2639"}],"articleNumber":"8234625","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":936},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Receivers","Transmitters","Nanobioscience","Signal detection","Modulation","Molecular communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","intersymbol interference","mobile communication","molecular communication (telecommunication)","signal detection","signal reconstruction","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile molecular communication","static transmitters","signal detection","adaptive ISI mitigation method","adaptive detection schemes","dynamic channel impulse response","adaptive threshold detection","mobile bacterium-based receiver","random walk","fixed distance","intersymbol interference effect","dynamic distance estimation","impulse response reconstruction","concentration-based adaptive threshold detection","peak-time-based adaptive detectio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal detection","mobile molecular communication","ISI mitigation","molecular communication"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Computers, Molecular","Nanotechnology","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Signal-To-Noise Ratio"]}],"abstract":"Current studies on modulation and detection schemes in molecular communication mainly focus on the scenarios with static transmitters and receivers. However, mobile molecular communication is needed in many envisioned applications, such as target tracking and drug delivery. Until now, investigations about mobile molecular communication have been limited. In this paper, a static transmitter and a mobile bacterium-based receiver performing random walk are considered. In this mobile scenario, the channel impulse response changes due to the dynamic change of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. Detection schemes based on fixed distance fail in signal detection in such a scenario. Furthermore, the intersymbol interference (ISI) effect becomes more complex due to the dynamic character of the signal which makes the estimation and mitigation of the ISI even more difficult. In this paper, an adaptive ISI mitigation method and two adaptive detection schemes are proposed for this mobile scenario. In the proposed scheme, adaptive ISI mitigation, estimation of dynamic distance, and the corresponding impulse response reconstruction are performed in each symbol interval. Based on the dynamic channel impulse response in each interval, two adaptive detection schemes, concentration-based adaptive threshold detection and peak-time-based adaptive detection, are proposed for signal detection. Simulations demonstrate that the ISI effect is significantly reduced and the adaptive detection schemes are reliable and robust for mobile molecular communication.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2017.2786229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/8320870/08234625.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8320870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2017.2786229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Detection and ISI Mitigation for Mobile Molecular Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Detection and ISI Mitigation for Mobile Molecular Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234625/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17649887","pubMedId":"29570072","htmlLink":"/document/8234625/","volume":"17","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502295 and 61405111"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Shanghai Sailing Program through STCSM","grantNumber":"14YF1408700"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFF0200705"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Engineering Research Center for Intelligent diagnosis and treatment instrument","grantNumber":"15DZ2252000"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Detection and ISI Mitigation for Mobile Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"tnb-yan-2786229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13569S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"8320870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"8320870","articleId":"8234625","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234626,"authors":[{"name":"Saeid Haghighatshoar","affiliation":["Communications and Information Theory Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8269342/8234626/haghi-2786276-small.gif","p":["Saeid Haghighatshoar (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc.\n and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007 and 2009,\n respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer and communication sciences from \u00c9cole Polytechnique\n F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2014.

We consider a special case of unlabeled sensing referred to as unlabeled ordered sampling (UOS) where the ordering of the measurements is preserved. We identify a natural duality between this problem and classical compressed sensing (CS), where we show that the unknown support (location of nonzero elements) of a sparse signal in CS corresponds to the unknown indices of the measurements in UOS. While in CS, it is possible to recover a sparse signal from an underdetermined set of linear equations (less equations than the signal dimension), successful recovery in UOS requires taking more samples than the dimension of the signal. Motivated by this duality, we develop a restricted isometry property (RIP) similar to that in CS. We also design a low-complexity alternating minimization algorithm that achieves a stable signal recovery under the established RIP. We analyze our proposed algorithm for different signal dimensions and number of measurements theoretically and investigate its performance empirically via numerical simulations. The results are reminiscent of a phase transition occurring in CS.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2786276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08234626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2786276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Recovery From Unlabeled Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal Recovery From Unlabeled Samples","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17535436","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234626/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Recovery From Unlabeled Samples","sourcePdf":"tsp-haghighatshoar-2786276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108391S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8234626","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234627,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Karlsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8234627/karls-2784809-small.gif","p":["Marcus Karlsson received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Link\u00f6ping University in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Division of Communication Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering.

This information needs to be reliably delivered to inactive users in the cell without any channel state information at the base station. Downlink transmission entails the use of downlink pilots and a special type of precoding that aims to reduce the dimension of the downlink channel and the pilot overhead, which would otherwise scale with the number of base station antennas. We consider a scenario in which the base station transmits over a small number of coherence intervals, providing little time/frequency diversity. The system information is transmitted with orthogonal space-time block codes to increase reliability and performance is measured using outage rates. Several different codes are compared, both for spatially correlated and uncorrelated channels and for varying amounts of time/frequency diversity. We show that a massive MIMO base station can outperform a single-antenna base station in all considered scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2784809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2784809","endPage":"1712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08234627.pdf","startPage":"1700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of In-Band Transmission of System Information in Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234627/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of In-Band Transmission of System Information in Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"17","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"17617716","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234627/","publicationDate":"March 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council"},{"fundingName":"ELLIIT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of In-Band Transmission of System Information in Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-karlsson-2784809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090105S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8234627","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234635,"authors":[{"name":"Wenxiu DING","affiliation":["School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Changan Qu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/9034462/8234635/ding-2786247-small.gif","p":["Wenxiu Ding received the BEng degree in information security from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2012.

Cloud overcomes the bottlenecks of resource-constrained user devices and greatly releases their storage and computing burdens. However, due to the lack of full trust in cloud service providers, the cloud users generally prefer to outsource their sensitive data in an encrypted form, which, however, seriously complicates data processing, analysis, as well as access control. Homomorphic encryption (HE) as a single key system cannot flexibly control data sharing and access after encrypted data processing. How to realize various computations over encrypted data in an efficient way and at the same time flexibly control the access to data processing results has been an important challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving data processing scheme with flexible access control. With the cooperation of a data service provider (DSP) and a computation party (CP), our scheme, based on Paillier's partial homomorphic encryption (PHE), realizes seven basic operations, i.e., Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Sign Acquisition, Absolute, Comparison, and Equality Test, over outsourced encrypted data. In addition, our scheme, based on the homomorphism of attribute-based encryption (ABE), is also designed to support flexible access control over processing results of encrypted data. We further prove the security of our scheme and demonstrate its efficiency and advantages through simulations and comparisons with existing work.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2017.2786247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2017.2786247","startPage":"363","endPage":"376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/9034462/08234635.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9034462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Data Processing with Flexible Access Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Data Processing with Flexible Access Control","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2020","accessionNumber":"19583451","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8234635/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672410 and U1536202"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2016ZDJC-06"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JBG161509"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013314","fundingName":"Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project","grantNumber":"B08038 and B16037"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"308087"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001961","fundingName":"AXA Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Privacy-Preserving Data Processing with Flexible Access Control","sourcePdf":"tdsc-yan-2786247-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.386796S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"9034462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"9034462","articleId":"8234635","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234637,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoyang Zhang","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing, Communication and Networking, Zhejiang, China","College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8329605/8234637/zhang-2786256-small.gif","p":["Zhaoyang\u00a0Zhang (M\u201902) received the Ph.D. degree in\n communication and information systems from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1998.

Specifically, it is difficult to recover information from the highly distorted samples as well as to obtain accurate channel estimation without increasing the number of pilots. In this paper, a novel inference algorithm called variational approximate message passing (VAMP) for one-bit quantized massive MIMO receiver is developed, which attempts to exploit the advantages of both the variational Bayesian inference algorithm and the bilinear generalized approximated message passing algorithm to accomplish joint channel estimation and data detection in a closed form with first-order complexity. Asymptotic state evolution analysis indicates the fast convergence rate of VAMP and also provides a lower bound for the data detection error. Moreover, through extensive simulations, we show that VAMP can achieve excellent detection performance with low pilot overhead in a wide range of scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2786256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8329605/08234637.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2786256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329605","startPage":"2358","endPage":"2373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Bit Quantized Massive MIMO Detection Based on Variational Approximate Message Passing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"One-Bit Quantized Massive MIMO Detection Based on Variational Approximate Message Passing","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"9","publicationDate":"1 May1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17669947","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234637/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61725104, 61371094 and 61631003"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.","grantNumber":"YB2013120029, YB2015040053 and HF2017010003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-Bit Quantized Massive MIMO Detection Based on Variational Approximate Message Passing","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2786256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150762S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8329605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8329605","articleId":"8234637","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234638,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan Whitehead","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Whitehead","id":"37086381093"},{"name":"Yixin Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Song","id":"37086380859"},{"name":"Shiuh-Hua Wood Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Shiuh-Hua","lastName":"Wood Chiang","orcid":"0000-0001-8091-6569","id":"37086243490"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8234638","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":561},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234638","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Clocks","Transconductance","Linearity","Circuits and systems","Power demand","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit measurement","low-power electronics","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complementary charge-steering amplifier","dynamic amplifiers","four-stage charge-steering amplifier","direct measurement results","high-gain amplifiers","charging-discharging cycles","charge-steering topology","delayed clocking scheme","power consumption","common-mode response","power supply rejection ratio","size 180 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charge-steering amplifier","operational amplifier","dynamic amplifier","dynamic circuit","charge redistribution"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents direct measurement of two novel dynamic amplifiers utilizing the \u201ccharge-steering\u201d topology.

Due to the inter-dependence of the transmit relay power and the residual self-interference in an FD-AF relay, we observe a distortion loop that degrades the system performance when relay dynamic range is not high. In this paper, we analyze the relay function, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the signal to distortion-plus-noise ratio under relay and source transmit power constraints. Due to the problem complexity, we propose a gradient-projection-based (GP) algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. Moreover, a non-alternating sub-optimal solution is proposed by assuming a rank-1 relay amplification matrix, and separating the design of the relay process into multiple stages (MuStR1). The proposed MuStR1 method is then enhanced by introducing an alternating update over the optimization variables, denoted as AltMuStR1 algorithm. Numerical simulations show that compared to GP, the proposed (Alt)MuStR1 algorithms significantly reduce the required computational complexity at the expense of a slight performance degradation. Moreover, as the hardware impairments increase, or for a system with a high transmit power, the impact of applying a distortion-aware design is significant.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2783934","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08234646.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2783934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Impairments Aware Transceiver Design for Full-Duplex Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Impairments Aware Transceiver Design for Full-Duplex Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617679","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234646/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Impairments Aware Transceiver Design for Full-Duplex Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relaying","sourcePdf":"twc-taghizadeh-2783934-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114039S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8234646","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234648,"authors":[{"name":"Yazid M.

Due to nodes mobility, the system's links are characterized by time-selective fading channels, which are modeled by the first-order-autoregressive (AR1) process, and due to imperfect CSI estimation, the estimated channel gains are assumed to be corrupted by Gaussian errors. For such a system model, an approach is proposed to derive a tight approximate expression for the system's conditional SEP. This approach is based on utilizing the AR1 model to derive exact expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios of the ALD decoder's decision variables, and on benefiting from the central limit theorem to approximate some of the non-Gaussian interference and noise terms. The obtained conditional SEP expression is function of both the fading channel correlation parameters and the estimation error variances, and thus, it is valid for mobile as well as static nodes for imperfect as well as perfect CSI estimation processes. The system's average SEP is evaluated semianalytically using the obtained conditional SEP expression. Numerical results along with Monte Carlo link-level simulations are provided to validate the accuracy of the presented analyses and to demonstrate the system performance under several realistic scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2786471","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08234648.pdf","startPage":"3447","endPage":"3456","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2786471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alamouti-OSTBC Wireless Cooperative Networks With Mobile Nodes and Imperfect CSI Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Alamouti-OSTBC Wireless Cooperative Networks With Mobile Nodes and Imperfect CSI Estimation","volume":"67","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17713529","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234648/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alamouti-OSTBC Wireless Cooperative Networks With Mobile Nodes and Imperfect CSI Estimation","sourcePdf":"tvt-khattabi-2786471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113683S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8234648","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8234649,"authors":[{"name":"Yingxiang Sun","affiliation":["Pillar of Engineering Product Development, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8234649/sun-2786219-small.gif","p":["Yingxiang Sun (S\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic\n and information engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2009, and the M.Eng. degree in\n electromagnetic field and microwave technology from the 54th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group\n Corporation, Shijiazhuang, China, in 2012.

Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08234653.pdf","startPage":"3685","endPage":"3689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2786303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2786303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Hybrid Precoding With Dynamic Beam Assignment in mmWave OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Precoding","Complexity theory","Vehicle dynamics","OFDM","Throughput","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","millimetre wave communication","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage multiuser hybrid zero-forcing precoding scheme","ZF precoding","variable beamwidth sector codeword","radio-frequency domain","hierarchical beam search","mmWave orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","mmWave OFDM systems","low-complexity hybrid precoding","low-complexity dynamic beam assignment strategies","beam broadening"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid precoding","hierarchical beam search","beam broadening","dynamic beam assignment, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","mmWave"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Hybrid Precoding With Dynamic Beam Assignment in mmWave OFDM Systems","volume":"67","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8234653/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17698998","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Projects","grantNumber":"2017ZX03001011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Hybrid Precoding With Dynamic Beam Assignment in mmWave OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhu-2786303-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069288S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8234653","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234655,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8234655/jian-2786230-small.gif","p":["Jian Wang (M\u201916) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in\n information and communication technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu,\n China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.","Since 2014, he has been an Associate Professor with the DSP Laboratory, University of Electronic Science and\n Technology of China.

Consequently, coder-decoder (CODEC) module, which greatly impacts the performance of CDMA NoCs, attracted growing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new parallel CODEC technique for CDMA NoCs. In general, by using a few simple logic circuits with small penalties in area and power, our new parallel (NPC) CODEC can execute the encoding/decoding process in parallel and thus reduce the data transfer latency. To reveal the benefits of our method for on-chip communication, we apply our NPC to CDMA NoCs and perform extensive experiments. From the results, we can find that our method outperforms existing parallel CODECs, such as Walsh-based parallel CODEC (WPC) and overloaded parallel CODEC (OPC). Specifically, it improves the critical point of communication latency (7.3% over WPC and 13.5% over OPC), reduces packet latency jitter by about 17.3% (against WPC) and 71.6% (against OPC), and improves energy efficiency by up to 41.2% (against WPC) and 59.2% (against OPC).","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2786230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8329255/08234655.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2786230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329255","startPage":"6527","endPage":"6537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Parallel CODEC Technique for CDMA NoCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Parallel CODEC Technique for CDMA NoCs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17661085","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234655/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671110 and 61201005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Parallel CODEC Technique for CDMA NoCs","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2786230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111044S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8329255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8329255","articleId":"8234655","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234658,"authors":[{"name":"Javier C\u00e9spedes","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Department, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8234658/cruz-2786638-small.gif","p":["Javier C\u00e9spedes was born in Ciudad Real, Spain, in 1988.

By employing social networking and device-to-device (D2D) communications in the IoT, the resulting social IoT can potentially provide services more effectively and efficiently. This paper focuses on content sharing among smart objects (devices) in the social IoT with D2D-based cooperative coded caching. Generally, complete content items or coded fragments are allowed to be delivered via multi-hop cooperative D2D communications. First, aiming at maximizing the overall success rate of multi-hop-based content sharing, the interplay between coding parameter optimization and wireless resource allocation is investigated by considering both physical and social characteristics. Moreover, a Roth and Vande Vate-based distributed scheme is proposed to solve the dynamic matching problem between the content helpers and content requesters. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a good tradeoff between system performance and computational complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Device-to-device communication","Maintenance engineering","Wireless communication","Encoding","Heuristic algorithms","Mobile communication","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","computational complexity","cooperative communication","encoding","Internet of Things","mobile computing","optimisation","radio networks","resource allocation","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matching theory","service providers","device-to-device communications","content sharing","coded caching","coding parameter optimization","physical characteristics","social characteristics","dynamic matching problem","D2D communications","social IoT","multihop cooperative caching","Internet of Things","Roth-Vande Vate-based distributed scheme","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-device communications","social internet of things","distributed caching","cooperative content sharing","distributed matching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2785250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8334009/08234659.pdf","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2785250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Hop Cooperative Caching in Social IoT Using Matching Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234659","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8334009/8234659-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Hop Cooperative Caching in Social IoT Using Matching Theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234659/","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234659/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17684284","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571056 and 61372117"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Science and Technology Nova Program","grantNumber":"xx2018083"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001017-004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.

The static random access memory (SRAM) cell test structure allowing precise measurement of read SNM was specifically designed and irradiated by gamma ray. Experimental results show that read SNM of 65-nm 6-T cell is sensitive to TID irradiation. The largest decrease of read SNM is 48 mV after 1000 krad(Si) irradiation, which is 36% of the value before TID irradiation. Being dependent on the measurement of radiation responses of cell transistors and simulation results, we conclude that the read SNM decrease is due to a threshold voltage shift induced by TID.

As an exercise in modeling with limited information, details of the 28-nm SRAM's cell structure were not used (and not available) to inform choices of device model parameters such as sensitive volume dimensions and efficiencies. Instead, inferences were made based on heavy-ion and proton single event upset data. Volume dimensions were sufficiently small to resolve the charge collection profile resulting from highly localized low linear energy transfer particle strikes. Results are compared to muon experimental data taken at TRIUMF for validation. Rate predictions are made for the 28-nm SRAM using the calibrated model and compared to expected neutron rates. Muon-induced upset rates at sea level for both marginally reduced and significantly reduced electrical biases, as well as rates at 39 000 feet, are predicted to be significantly less than neutron rates in all these environments. This result is consistent with other authors' efforts in similarly scaled bulk CMOS SRAMs, indicating that the modeling method used is reliable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234670/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8234670/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17577899","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Muon-Induced SEU Rates for a 28-nm SRAM Using Protons and Heavy Ions to Calibrate the Sensitive Volume Model","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000774","fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency Basic Research Program","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-12-1-0025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Muon-Induced SEU Rates for a 28-nm SRAM Using Protons and Heavy Ions to Calibrate the Sensitive Volume Model","sourcePdf":"tns-trippe-2786585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112397S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"8291031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8291031","articleId":"8234670","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8234671,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Signal Processing, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8269342/8234671/gao-2786220-small.gif","p":["Yuan Gao (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree from the School of\n Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree from the Faculty of\n Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 2011, and the Ph.D.\n degree from the Institute of Digital Signal Processing, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany, in 2017.

Antenna selection can alleviate the requirement on the number of RF transceivers, thus being attractive for massive MIMO systems. In massive MIMO antenna selection systems, RF switching architectures need to be carefully considered. In this paper, we examine two switching architectures, i.e., full-array and sub-array. By assuming independent and identically distributed Rayleigh flat fading channels, we use asymptotic theory on order statistics to derive the asymptotic upper capacity bounds of massive MIMO channels with antenna selection for the both switching architectures in the large-scale limit. We also use the derived bounds to further derive the upper bounds of the ergodic achievable spectral efficiency considering the channel state information (CSI) acquisition. It is also showed that the ergodic capacity of sub-array antenna selection system scales no faster than double logarithmic rate. In addition, optimal antenna selection algorithms based on branch-and-bound are proposed for both switching architectures. Our results show that the derived asymptotic bounds are effective and also apply to the finite-dimensional MIMO. The CSI acquisition is one of the main limits for the massive MIMO antenna selection systems in the time-variant channels. The proposed optimal antenna selection algorithms are much faster than the exhaustive-search-based antenna selection, e.g., 1000 \u00d7 speedup observed in the large-scale system. Interestingly, the full-array and sub-array systems have very close performance, which is validated by their exact capacities and their close upper bounds on capacity.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2786220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08234671.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2786220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO Antenna Selection: Switching Architectures, Capacity Bounds, and Optimal Antenna Selection Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO Antenna Selection: Switching Architectures, Capacity Bounds, and Optimal Antenna Selection Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234671/","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17524200","htmlLink":"/document/8234671/","volume":"66","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","grantNumber":"S04 and M01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO Antenna Selection: Switching Architectures, Capacity Bounds, and Optimal Antenna Selection Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsp-gao-2786220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103379S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8234671","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234672,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8234672/song-2786198-small.gif","p":["Qiang Song (M\u201914) was born in Changchun, China, in 1975.

The use of multiple landmarks each with multiple antennas enhances the spatial resolution of radio transmitters, and thus improves the spoofing detection accuracy of PHY-layer authentication. Unlike most existing PHY-layer authentication schemes that apply hypothesis tests and rely on the known radio channel model, we propose a logistic regression-based authentication to remove the assumption on the known channel model, and thus be applicable to more generic wireless networks. The Frank-Wolfe algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the logistic regression model, in which the convex problem under a \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm constraint is solved for weight sparsity to avoid over-fitting in the learning process. We design a distributed Frank-Wolfe-based PHY-layer authentication to further reduce the communication overhead between the landmarks and the security agent. Then, we construct an incremental aggregated gradient-based scheme to provide online authentication with a higher accuracy and lower computation overhead. Simulation and experimental results validate the accuracy of the proposed authentication schemes, and show the reduced communication and computation overheads.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2784431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08234675.pdf","startPage":"1676","endPage":"1687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2784431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PHY-Layer Authentication With Multiple Landmarks With Reduced Overhead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234675","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8309484/8234675-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"PHY-Layer Authentication With Multiple Landmarks With Reduced Overhead","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234675/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17617692","htmlLink":"/document/8234675/","volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671396 and 91638204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2018D08"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1717454, CNS-1731424, CNS-1702850, CNS-1646607, ECCS-1547201, CMMI-1434789, CNS-1443917 and ECCS-1405121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"PHY-Layer Authentication With Multiple Landmarks With Reduced Overhead","sourcePdf":"twc-xiao-2784431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155501S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8234675","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234686,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8234686/fwang-2785305-small.gif","p":["Feng Wang (M\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2009, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Fudan University, China, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a unified MEC-WPT design by considering a wireless powered multiuser MEC system, where a multiantenna access point (AP) (integrated with an MEC server) broadcasts wireless power to charge multiple users and each user node relies on the harvested energy to execute computation tasks. With MEC, these users can execute their respective tasks locally by themselves or offload all or part of them to the AP based on a time-division multiple access protocol. Building on the proposed model, we develop an innovative framework to improve the MEC performance, by jointly optimizing the energy transmit beamforming at the AP, the central processing unit frequencies and the numbers of offloaded bits at the users, as well as the time allocation among users. Under this framework, we address a practical scenario where latency-limited computation is required. In this case, we develop an optimal resource allocation scheme that minimizes the AP's total energy consumption subject to the users' individual computation latency constraints. Leveraging the state-of-the-art optimization techniques, we derive the optimal solution in a semiclosed form. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed design over alternative benchmark schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2785305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2785305","startPage":"1784","endPage":"1797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08234686.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Offloading and Computing Optimization in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8309484/8234686-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Offloading and Computing Optimization in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Systems","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17630451","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234686/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB0403402"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671154"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000005","fundingName":"DoD","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-13-1-0029"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61328102/61629101"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Fundamental Research Fund","grantNumber":"KQTD2015033114415450"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"DMS-1622433, AST-1547436, ECCS-1508051/1659025 and CNS-1343155"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Joint Offloading and Computing Optimization in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2785305-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140138S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8234686","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234693,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Herbert","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8269342/8234693/herbe-2786277-small.gif","p":["Steven Herbert received the M.A. (Cantab.) and M.Eng. degrees from\n the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the\n Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, in 2015.

Previously, only cost functions corresponding to a lower bound on the expected mean squared error have been expressed for optimization. In this paper, we express an exact cost function to optimize for minimum mean squared error adaptive waveform design (MMSE-AWD). This is expressed in a general form which can be applied to nonlinear systems. Additionally, we provide a general example for how this method of MMSE-AWD can be applied to a system that estimates the state using a particle filter (PF). We make the case that there is a compelling reason to choose to use the PF (as opposed to alternatives such as the unscented Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter), as our MMSE-AWD implementation can reuse the particles and particle weightings from the PF, simplifying the overall computation. Finally, we provide a numerical example, based on a simplified multiple-input-multiple-output radar system, which demonstrates that our MMSE-AWD method outperforms a simple nonadaptive radar, whose beam-pattern has a uniform angular spread, and also an existing approximate MMSE-AWD method.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2786277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08234693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2786277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE Adaptive Waveform Design for Active Sensing With Applications to MIMO Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MMSE Adaptive Waveform Design for Active Sensing With Applications to MIMO Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17524208","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234693/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K014277/1"},{"fundingName":"MOD University Defence Research Collaboration in Signal Processing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE Adaptive Waveform Design for Active Sensing With Applications to MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-herbert-2786277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095374S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8234693","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234695,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Lin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8329255/8234695/lin-2786290-small.gif","p":["Feng Lin (M\u201914) received the B.Eng. degree in information\n engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetic fields and microwave technology from the South China University of\n Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

Involving all sensors increases the energy budget unnecessarily and decreases the lifetime of the WASN. Using microphone subset selection, also termed as sensor selection, the most informative sensors can be chosen from a set of candidate sensors to achieve a prescribed inference performance. In this paper, we consider microphone subset selection for minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer based noise reduction. The best subset of sensors is determined by minimizing the transmission cost while constraining the output noise power (or signal-to-noise ratio). Assuming the statistical information on correlation matrices of the sensor measurements is available, the sensor selection problem for this model-driven scheme is first solved by utilizing convex optimization techniques. In addition, to avoid estimating the statistics related to all the candidate sensors beforehand, we also propose a data-driven approach to select the best subset using a greedy strategy. The performance of the greedy algorithm converges to that of the model-driven method, while it displays advantages in dynamic scenarios as well as on computational complexity. Compared to a sparse MVDR or radius-based beamformer, experiments show that the proposed methods can guarantee the desired performance with significantly less transmission costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17534889","htmlLink":"/document/8234698/","displayDocTitle":"Microphone Subset Selection for MVDR Beamformer Based Noise Reduction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council and Circuits and Systems (CAS) Group"},{"fundingName":"Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"},{"fundingName":"ASPIRE Project (Project 14926 within the STW OTP program)"},{"fundingName":"Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)"},{"fundingName":"KAUST-MIT-TUD consortium","grantNumber":"OSR-2015-Sensors-2700"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microphone Subset Selection for MVDR Beamformer Based Noise Reduction","sourcePdf":"taslp-zhang-2786544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148843S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8253682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8253682","articleId":"8234698","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8234700,"authors":[{"name":"Zhetao Li","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Chian"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8426041/8234700/li-2786307-small.gif","p":["Zhetao Li (M\u201917) received the B.

However, there are common security and privacy challenges caused by untrusted and nontransparent energy markets in these scenarios. To address the security challenges, we exploit the consortium blockchain technology to propose a secure energy trading system named energy blockchain. This energy blockchain can be widely used in general scenarios of P2P energy trading getting rid of a trusted intermediary. Besides, to reduce the transaction limitation resulted from transaction confirmation delays on the energy blockchain, we propose a credit-based payment scheme to support fast and frequent energy trading. An optimal pricing strategy using Stackelberg game for credit-based loans is also proposed. Security analysis and numerical results based on a real dataset illustrate that the proposed energy blockchain and credit-based payment scheme are secure and efficient in IIoT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","volume":"14","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"18007451","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8234700/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Consortium Blockchain for Secure Energy Trading in Industrial Internet of Things","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61379115, 61422201, 61501127, 61370159, U1301255 and U1501251"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015B010129001, 2016A030313705, 2014B090907010 and 2015B010131014"},{"fundingName":"Special-Support Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014TQ01X100"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"2014J2200097"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway","grantNumber":"240079/F20"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consortium Blockchain for Secure Energy Trading in Industrial Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tii-zhang-2786307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11785S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8426041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"8426041","articleId":"8234700","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8234703,"authors":[{"name":"Dongdong Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shanghai Institute for Advanced Communication and Data Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8234703/jiang-2784427-small.gif","p":["Dongdong Jiang received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiao Tong University, China, in 2015.

In this paper, we propose two partition-based caching designs, i.e., a coded caching design based on random linear network coding and an uncoded caching design. We consider the analysis and optimization of the two caching designs in a large-scale successive interference cancelation (SIC)-enabled wireless network. First, under each caching design, by utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression for the successful transmission probability in the general file size regime. We also derive closed-form expressions in the small and large file size regimes, respectively. Then, under each caching design, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization in the general file size regime, which is an NP-hard problem. By exploring structural properties, we obtain a near optimal solution with 1/2 approximation guarantee and polynomial complexity. We also obtain closed-form asymptotically optimal solutions. The analysis and optimization results show the advantage of the coded caching design over the uncoded caching design, and reveal the impact of caching and SIC capabilities. Finally, we numerically show that the two proposed caching designs achieve significant performance gains over some baseline caching designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08234703.pdf","startPage":"1660","endPage":"1675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2784427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2784427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8234703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partition-Based Caching in Large-Scale SIC-Enabled Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon carbide","Wireless networks","Optimization","Interference","Geometry","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cache storage","computational complexity","encoding","interference suppression","network coding","polynomials","probability","radio networks","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless network","potential caching","advanced wireless networks","partition-based caching designs","coded caching design","random linear network coding","uncoded caching design","general file size regime","baseline caching designs","successive interference cancelation","stochastic geometry","transmission probability maximization","polynomial complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cache","network coding","successive interference cancelation","stochastic geometry","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8234703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Partition-Based Caching in Large-Scale SIC-Enabled Wireless Networks","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8234703/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617715","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401272 and 61521062"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partition-Based Caching in Large-Scale SIC-Enabled Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-cui-2784427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114633S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8234703","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8234704,"authors":[{"name":"Niklas Doose","affiliation":["Chair of Information and Coding Theory, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8309484/8234704/doose-2785220-small.gif","p":["Niklas Doose received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Kiel University, Germany, in 2012 and 2013, respectively.

An illustrative example identifies weaknesses of sum-power optimized precoding schemes, when they are scaled to comply with an EIRP limit.

Early studies showed that a decrease in the size of an antenna results in a direct reduction in its bandwidth and efficiency (hr) [1], [2]. The size limitation translates into a lower boundary on the achievable radiation quality factor (Q factor) and consequently on the maximum achievable impedance bandwidth. Recently, many new investigations have been conducted to reduce the form factor (or the overall size) of different types of antennas while trying to maintain acceptable matching properties and operating bandwidth.

In view of these study findings, in this letter, we attempt to adaptively and explicitly combine the activations from intermediate and FC layers to generate a new CNN with directed acyclic graph topology, which is called the converted CNN.

However, it just brings very limited performance gain about 0.2-0.4 dB compared with the plain spatial multiplexing scheme in high correlation channels, while it has not any gain in low correlation channels. In this paper, a nonbinary (NB) LDPC coded modulation (CM) eSM scheme is proposed. The binary DVB-NGH LDPC codes are replaced by regular quasi-cyclic NB LDPC codes, and each NB-LDPC coded symbol is directly mapped to two modulation symbols on two transmit antennas. To investigate the performance gain, average mutual information performances of bit-interleaved-coded-modulation (BICM) and CM MIMO systems are analyzed in flat Rayleigh fading channels, which are corresponding to the binary and NB coding scheme, respectively. The information-theoretic analysis turns out that the proposed NB-LDPC CM-MIMO scheme is much superior to the current binary-LDPC BICM-eSM scheme. Simulation results also verify that the proposed scheme has significant up to 3dB performance gain compared with the BICM-eSM scheme under different modulation orders, power imbalances, and channel correlations. Therefore, the proposed scheme is much more reliable and robust, and thus very suitable for the future broadcasting applications.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2017.2781119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8372838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2017.2781119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/8372838/08237200.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC-Coded Spatial Multiplexing for Rate-2 MIMO of DVB-NGH System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Nonbinary LDPC-Coded Spatial Multiplexing for Rate-2 MIMO of DVB-NGH System","volume":"64","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237200/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17821741","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237200/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Fund","grantNumber":"61171101"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonbinary LDPC-Coded Spatial Multiplexing for Rate-2 MIMO of DVB-NGH System","sourcePdf":"tbc-wu-2781119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098183S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"8372838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8372838","articleId":"8237200","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237202,"authors":[{"name":"Farnood Merrikh-Bayat","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8468244/8237202/merri-2778940-small.gif","p":["Farnood Merrikh-Bayat received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008, and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, in 2015.","He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher in computer engineering with the University of California until 2017.

Given the prior likelihood distribution of area importance, this brief aims to generate UAV feasible routes which maximize the cumulative probability of finding a single and stationary target within the required time. First, Gaussian mixture model is used to approximate the prior likelihood distribution, and several river segments with high detection probability corresponding to Gaussian components can be extracted. With the consideration of quantified factors, the river subregions are prioritized by the approximation insertion method and then allocated to UAVs. Moreover, to meet the terminal time constraint, the so-called positive/negative greedy method is proposed to expand or contract waypoints. Finally, the performance of our proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulations on a real river map, and the results verify its good performance in various scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2017.2781655","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/8633581/08237204.pdf","startPage":"822","endPage":"829","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/08237204.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2017.2781655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal UAV Route Planning for Coverage Search of Stationary Target in River","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal UAV Route Planning for Coverage Search of Stationary Target in River","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18416305","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8237204/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M622278"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"201713046"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571408 and 51409237"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal UAV Route Planning for Coverage Search of Stationary Target in River","sourcePdf":"tcst-yao-2781655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064566S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8633581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8633581","articleId":"8237204","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237209,"authors":[{"name":"Zimu Guo","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8320391/8237209/guo-2777262-small.gif","p":["Zimu Guo (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in automation and control from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China, in 2012 and the M.E. degree in electronics engineering from The State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA, in 2013.

Recycled ICs are those harvested from old systems and resold in the supply chain as new. Such ICs exhibit lower performance and shorter lifetime and, as a result, pose threats to the security and reliability of electronic systems. In this paper, we propose a recycled IC detection framework called static random-access memory (SRAM)-based countermeasure against IC recycling (SCARe) to detect the aging of SRAM cells. Our framework can be applied to both standalone SRAM chips and system on chips with embedded SRAM. For each SRAM under detection, statistical analysis is conducted to differentiate the recycled and new ICs. To mimic the practical aging scenario, 16 commodity SRAM chips from three different manufacturers and different technology nodes (e.g., 90, 110, and 130 nm) are stressed under high-temperature and supply-voltage conditions for different periods of time. The experimental results from new and aged SRAM chips, which represents recycled ICs, demonstrate that our proposed technology can achieve extremely high-detection success rate (no lower than 96.5%). The minimal in-field usage, which can be detected by SCARe, is 7 h.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2777262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8320391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2777262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8320391/08237209.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SCARe: An SRAM-Based Countermeasure Against IC Recycling","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/8320391/8237209-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"SCARe: An SRAM-Based Countermeasure Against IC Recycling","volume":"26","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237209/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17649888","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative","grantNumber":"FA9550-14-1-0351"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1561023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2648"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"SCARe: An SRAM-Based Countermeasure Against IC Recycling","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-guo-2777262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114969S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8320391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8320391","articleId":"8237209","onlineDate":"22 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237279,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Kendall","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Kendall","id":"37085764957"},{"name":"Hayk Martirosyan","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Hayk","lastName":"Martirosyan","id":"37086300138"},{"name":"Saumitro Dasgupta","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Saumitro","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37086301998"},{"name":"Peter Henry","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Henry","id":"37544758200"},{"name":"Ryan Kennedy","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37088334204"},{"name":"Abraham Bachrach","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Bachrach","id":"37320254600"},{"name":"Adam Bry","affiliation":["Skydio Research"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Bry","id":"37969339700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237279","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":249,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1258},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Machine learning","Computer architecture","Semantics","Computational modeling","Two dimensional displays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image matching","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disparity values","3-D convolutions","contextual information","deep feature representations","stereo images","deep learning architecture","deep stereo regression","additional post-processing","method end-to-end","differentiable soft argmin operation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel deep learning architecture for regressing disparity from a rectified pair of stereo images.

Recent years have seen many shallow tracking methods based on real-time pixel-based correlation filters, as well as deep methods that have top performance but need a high-end GPU. In this paper, we learn to improve the speed of deep trackers without losing accuracy. Our fundamental insight is to take an adaptive approach, where easy frames are processed with cheap features (such as pixel values), while challenging frames are processed with invariant but expensive deep features. We formulate the adaptive tracking problem as a decision-making process, and learn an agent to decide whether to locate objects with high confidence on an early layer, or continue processing subsequent layers of a network. This significantly reduces the feedforward cost for easy frames with distinct or slow-moving objects. We train the agent offline in a reinforcement learning fashion, and further demonstrate that learning all deep layers (so as to provide good features for adaptive tracking) can lead to near real-time average tracking speed of 23 fps on a single CPU while achieving state-of-the-art performance. Perhaps most tellingly, our approach provides a 100X speedup for almost 50% of the time, indicating the power of an adaptive approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.21","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237283.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Policies for Adaptive Tracking with Deep Feature Cascades","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237283/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Policies for Adaptive Tracking with Deep Feature Cascades","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467967","htmlLink":"/document/8237283/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Policies for Adaptive Tracking with Deep Feature Cascades","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112086S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237287,"authors":[{"name":"Jaesik Park","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Jaesik","lastName":"Park","id":"37085789630"},{"name":"Qian-Yi Zhou","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Qian-Yi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085751841"},{"name":"Vladlen Koltun","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Vladlen","lastName":"Koltun","id":"37739465900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237287","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1344},"abstract":"We present an algorithm for aligning two colored point clouds.

Our framework first integrates multi-level feature maps into multiple resolutions, which simultaneously incorporate coarse semantics and fine details. Then it adaptively learns to combine these feature maps at each resolution and predict saliency maps with the combined features. Finally, the predicted results are efficiently fused to generate the final saliency map. In addition, to achieve accurate boundary inference and semantic enhancement, edge-aware feature maps in low-level layers and the predicted results of low resolution features are recursively embedded into the learning framework. By aggregating multi-level convolutional features in this efficient and flexible manner, the proposed saliency model provides accurate salient object labeling.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep fully convolutional network model for accurate salient object detection. The key contribution of this work is to learn deep uncertain convolutional features (UCF), which encourage the robustness and accuracy of saliency detection. We achieve this via introducing a reformulated dropout (R-dropout) after specific convolutional layers to construct an uncertain ensemble of internal feature units. In addition, we propose an effective hybrid upsampling method to reduce the checkerboard artifacts of deconvolution operators in our decoder network. The proposed methods can also be applied to other deep convolutional networks. Compared with existing saliency detection methods, the proposed UCF model is able to incorporate uncertainties for more accurate object boundary inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed saliency model performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. The uncertain feature learning mechanism as well as the upsampling method can significantly improve performance on other pixel-wise vision tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.32","startPage":"212","endPage":"221","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237294.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Uncertain Convolutional Features for Accurate Saliency Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237294/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Uncertain Convolutional Features for Accurate Saliency Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453142","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237294/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Uncertain Convolutional Features for Accurate Saliency Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119074S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237296,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Wieschollek","affiliation":["University of T\u00fcbingen","Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Wieschollek","id":"37086109210"},{"name":"Michael Hirsch","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hirsch","id":"37543623000"},{"name":"Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sch\u00f6lkopf","id":"37265889200"},{"name":"Hendrik P.A.

However, taking a quick shot frequently yields a blurry result due to unwanted camera shake during recording or moving objects in the scene. Removing these artifacts from the blurry recordings is a highly ill-posed problem as neither the sharp image nor the motion blur kernel is known. Propagating information between multiple consecutive blurry observations can help restore the desired sharp image or video.

Recent approaches merge these two steps into a single convolution process by convolving input frames with spatially adaptive kernels that account for motion and re-sampling simultaneously. These methods require large kernels to handle large motion, which limits the number of pixels whose kernels can be estimated at once due to the large memory demand. To address this problem, this paper formulates frame interpolation as local separable convolution over input frames using pairs of 1D kernels. Compared to regular 2D kernels, the 1D kernels require significantly fewer parameters to be estimated. Our method develops a deep fully convolutional neural network that takes two input frames and estimates pairs of 1D kernels for all pixels simultaneously. Since our method is able to estimate kernels and synthesizes the whole video frame at once, it allows for the incorporation of perceptual loss to train the neural network to produce visually pleasing frames. This deep neural network is trained end-to-end using widely available video data without any human annotation. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method provides a practical solution to high-quality video frame interpolation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237299/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17453138","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Separable Convolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Separable Convolution","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121359S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237301,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sadegh Aliakbarian","affiliation":["Australian National University","Smart Vision Systems, CSIRO"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sadegh","lastName":"Aliakbarian","id":"37074126700"},{"name":"Fatemeh Sadat Saleh","affiliation":["Australian National University","Smart Vision Systems, CSIRO"],"firstName":"Fatemeh Sadat","lastName":"Saleh","id":"37076638000"},{"name":"Mathieu Salzmann","affiliation":["CVLab, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Salzmann","id":"37397917300"},{"name":"Basura Fernando","affiliation":["Australian National University"],"firstName":"Basura","lastName":"Fernando","id":"37997075800"},{"name":"Lars Petersson","affiliation":["Australian National University","Smart Vision Systems, CSIRO"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Petersson","id":"37281298200"},{"name":"Lars Andersson","affiliation":["Smart Vision Systems, CSIRO"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Andersson","id":"37569627000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237301","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encouraging LSTMs to Anticipate Actions Very Early","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237301.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.39","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Adaptive optics","Predictive models","Context modeling","Optical imaging","Videos","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image motion analysis","image recognition","image sequences","recurrent neural nets","ubiquitous computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially available videos","computer vision applications","action anticipation method","video sequence","multistage LSTM architecture","early prediction","action recognition","context-aware features","action-aware features","loss function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237301","abstract":"In contrast to the widely studied problem of recognizing an action given a complete sequence, action anticipation aims to identify the action from only partially available videos.

Crucially, the agent must decide where to look in the upcoming frames, when to reinitialize because it believes the target has been lost, and when to update its appearance model for the tracked object. Such decisions are typically made heuristically. Instead, we propose to learn an optimal decision-making policy by formulating tracking as a partially observable decision-making process (POMDP).

Then we map the TSC with a special type of stacked Recurrent Neural Network (sRNN). By taking advantage of sRNN in learning all parameters simultaneously, the nontrivial hyper-parameter selection to TSC can be avoided, meanwhile with a shallow sRNN, the reconstruction coefficients can be inferred within a forward pass, which reduces the computational cost for learning sparse coefficients. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: i) We propose a TSC, which can be mapped to a sRNN which facilitates the parameter optimization and accelerates the anomaly prediction. ii) We build a very large dataset which is even larger than the summation of all existing dataset for anomaly detection in terms of both the volume of data and the diversity of scenes. Extensive experiments on both a toy dataset and real datasets demonstrate that our TSC based and sRNN based method consistently outperform existing methods, which validates the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237307/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Revisit of Sparse Coding Based Anomaly Detection in Stacked RNN Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Revisit of Sparse Coding Based Anomaly Detection in Stacked RNN Framework","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05621S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8237308,"authors":[{"name":"Xihui Liu","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited","The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xihui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086254297"},{"name":"Haiyu Zhao","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited"],"firstName":"Haiyu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086217578"},{"name":"Maoqing Tian","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited"],"firstName":"Maoqing","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086218132"},{"name":"Lu Sheng","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37085382788"},{"name":"Jing Shao","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Shao","id":"37086226652"},{"name":"Shuai Yi","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Yi","id":"37086214246"},{"name":"Junjie Yan","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086197492"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086269902"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237308","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237308","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Semantics","Visualization","Computer vision","Hair","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","pedestrians","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attentive deep features","pedestrian analysis","intelligent video surveillance","security-centric computer vision systems","convolutional neural networks","fine-grained tasks","HydraPlus-Net","HPnet","multilevel attention maps","HP-net","multiscale selectiveness","attentive features","pedestrian image","pedestrian attribute recognition","person reidentification","feature representations","discriminative features learning","attention-based deep neural network","feature layers"]}],"abstract":"Pedestrian analysis plays a vital role in intelligent video surveillance and is a key component for security-centric computer vision systems. Despite that the convolutional neural networks are remarkable in learning discriminative features from images, the learning of comprehensive features of pedestrians for fine-grained tasks remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a new attentionbased deep neural network, named as HydraPlus-Net (HPnet), that multi-directionally feeds the multi-level attention maps to different feature layers. The attentive deep features learned from the proposed HP-net bring unique advantages: (1) the model is capable of capturing multiple attentions from low-level to semantic-level, and (2) it explores the multi-scale selectiveness of attentive features to enrich the final feature representations for a pedestrian image. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed HP-net for pedestrian analysis on two tasks, i.e. pedestrian attribute recognition and person reidentification. Intensive experimental results have been provided to prove that the HP-net outperforms the state-of-theart methods on various datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.46","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237308.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HydraPlus-Net: Attentive Deep Features for Pedestrian Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"HydraPlus-Net: Attentive Deep Features for Pedestrian Analysis","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237308/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453305","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HydraPlus-Net: Attentive Deep Features for Pedestrian Analysis","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085494S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237309,"authors":[{"name":"Yair Movshovitz-Attias","affiliation":["Google Research"],"firstName":"Yair","lastName":"Movshovitz-Attias","id":"38275778300"},{"name":"Alexander Toshev","affiliation":["Google Research"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Toshev","id":"37300077100"},{"name":"Thomas K.

Traditionally, for this problem supervision is expressed in the form of sets of points that follow an ordinal relationship - an anchor point x is similar to a set of positive points Y , and dissimilar to a set of negative points Z, and a loss defined over these distances is minimized. While the specifics of the optimization differ, in this work we collectively call this type of supervision Triplets and all methods that follow this pattern Triplet-Based methods. These methods are challenging to optimize. A main issue is the need for finding informative triplets, which is usually achieved by a variety of tricks such as increasing the batch size, hard or semi-hard triplet mining, etc. Even with these tricks, the convergence rate of such methods is slow. In this paper we propose to optimize the triplet loss on a different space of triplets, consisting of an anchor data point and similar and dissimilar proxy points which are learned as well. These proxies approximate the original data points, so that a triplet loss over the proxies is a tight upper bound of the original loss. This proxy-based loss is empirically better behaved. As a result, the proxy-loss improves on state-of-art results for three standard zero-shot learning datasets, by up to 15% points, while converging three times as fast as other triplet-based losses.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.47","startPage":"360","endPage":"368","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237309.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"No Fuss Distance Metric Learning Using Proxies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"No Fuss Distance Metric Learning Using Proxies","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237309/","accessionNumber":"17453035","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237309/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No Fuss Distance Metric Learning Using Proxies","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064364S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":8237310,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Ruggero Ronchi","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matteo Ruggero","lastName":"Ronchi","id":"37085992364"},{"name":"Pietro Perona","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Perona","id":"37282902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237310","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pose estimation","Benchmark testing","Algorithm design and analysis","Jitter","Measurement","Wrist"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","estimation theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","pose estimation","software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error diagnosis","multiinstance pose estimation","principled benchmark","instance attributes","human pose estimation","instance size","multiple instances","estimation algorithms","software tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237310","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237310.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking and Error Diagnosis in Multi-instance Pose Estimation","abstract":"We propose a new method to analyze the impact of errors in algorithms for multi-instance pose estimation and a principled benchmark that can be used to compare them.

Unlike previous two stage approaches that train the two sub-networks sequentially and separately, our training is end-to-end and fully exploits the correlation between the 2D pose and depth estimation sub-tasks. The deep features are better learnt through shared representations. In doing so, the 3D pose labels in controlled lab environments are transferred to in the wild images. In addition, we introduce a 3D geometric constraint to regularize the 3D pose prediction, which is effective in the absence of ground truth depth labels.

The accuracy of detection suffers from degenerated object appearances in videos, e.g., motion blur, video defocus, rare poses, etc. Existing work attempts to exploit temporal information on box level, but such methods are not trained end-to-end. We present flow-guided feature aggregation, an accurate and end-to-end learning framework for video object detection. It leverages temporal coherence on feature level instead. It improves the per-frame features by aggregation of nearby features along the motion paths, and thus improves the video recognition accuracy.

We introduce two novelties, a corner based region-of-interest estimator and a deconvolution based CNN model. The resulting model is scene adaptive, does not require manually defined reference bounding boxes and produces highly competitive results on MSCOCO, Pascal VOC 2007 and Pascal VOC 2012 with real-time evaluation rates. Further analysis suggests our model performs particularly well when finegrained object localization is desirable.

In this work, we achieve the interpretable and contextualized multi-label image classification by developing a recurrent memorized-attention module. This module consists of two alternately performed components: i) a spatial transformer layer to locate attentional regions from the convolutional feature maps in a region-proposal-free way and ii) an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) sub-network to sequentially predict semantic labeling scores on the located regions while capturing the global dependencies of these regions. The LSTM also output the parameters for computing the spatial transformer.

Doing so entails knowledge about objects and their affordances, as well as actions and their preconditions and effects.

Here two parallel neural networks are coordinated to learn complementary features and thus a wider network is constructed. Specifically, we logically divide an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network into two functional parts, i.e., feature extractor and image classifier. The extractors of two subnetworks are placed side by side, which exactly form the feature extractor of DualNet. Then the two-stream features are aggregated to the final classifier for overall classification, while two auxiliary classifiers are appended behind the feature extractor of each subnetwork to make the separately learned features discriminative alone. The complementary constraint is imposed by weighting the three classifiers, which is indeed the key of DualNet. The corresponding training strategy is also proposed, consisting of iterative training and joint fine tuning, to make the two subnetworks cooperate well with each other. Finally, DualNet based on the well-known CaffeNet, VGGNet, NIN and ResNet are thoroughly investigated and experimentally evaluated on multiple datasets including CIFAR-100, Stanford Dogs and UEC FOOD-100. The results demonstrate that DualNet can really help learn more accurate image representation, and thus result in higher accuracy for recognition.

This makes FGVC very challenging because: (i) part annotation and detection require expert guidance and are very expensive; (ii) parts are of different sizes; and (iii) the part interactions are complex and of higher-order. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end framework based on higher-order integration of hierarchical convolutional activations for FGVC. By treating the convolutional activations as local descriptors, hierarchical convolutional activations can serve as a representation of local parts from different scales. A polynomial kernel based predictor is proposed to capture higher-order statistics of convolutional activations for modeling part interaction. To model inter-layer part interactions, we extend polynomial predictor to integrate hierarchical activations via kernel fusion. Our work also provides a new perspective for combining convolutional activations from multiple layers. While hypercolumns simply concatenate maps from different layers, and holistically-nested network uses weighted fusion to combine side-outputs, our approach exploits higher-order intra-layer and inter-layer relations for better integration of hierarchical convolutional features. The proposed framework yields more discriminative representation and achieves competitive results on the widely used FGVC datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.63","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237325.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Higher-Order Integration of Hierarchical Convolutional Activations for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Higher-Order Integration of Hierarchical Convolutional Activations for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237325/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453097","htmlLink":"/document/8237325/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher-Order Integration of Hierarchical Convolutional Activations for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157837S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237326,"authors":[{"name":"Tseng-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tseng-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085872338"},{"name":"Yuan-Hong Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hong","lastName":"Liao","id":"37086275425"},{"name":"Ching-Yao Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Yao","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37086279453"},{"name":"Wan-Ting Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wan-Ting","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37086279617"},{"name":"Jianlong Fu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianlong","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085509034"},{"name":"Min Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085873757"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237326","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Birds","Standards","Training data","Planning","Testing","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","inference mechanisms","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MSCOCO","image captioning","generated sentence assessment","inference","cross-domain image captioning","paired training data","significant domain shifts","sentence pairs","training image","cross-domain image captioner","indistinguishable sentences","captioner act","multimodal critic","domain critic","critic networks","adversarial training procedure"]}],"abstract":"Impressive image captioning results are achieved in domains with plenty of training image and sentence pairs (e.g., MSCOCO). However, transferring to a target domain with significant domain shifts but no paired training data (referred to as cross-domain image captioning) remains largely unexplored. We propose a novel adversarial training procedure to leverage unpaired data in the target domain. Two critic networks are introduced to guide the captioner, namely domain critic and multi-modal critic. The domain critic assesses whether the generated sentences are indistinguishable from sentences in the target domain. The multi-modal critic assesses whether an image and its generated sentence are a valid pair. During training, the critics and captioner act as adversaries - captioner aims to generate indistinguishable sentences, whereas critics aim at distinguishing them. The assessment improves the captioner through policy gradient updates. During inference, we further propose a novel critic-based planning method to select high-quality sentences without additional supervision (e.g., tags). To evaluate, we use MSCOCO as the source domain and four other datasets (CUB-200-2011, Oxford-102, TGIF, and Flickr30k) as the target domains. Our method consistently performs well on all datasets. In particular, on CUB-200-2011, we achieve 21.8% CIDEr-D improvement after adaptation. Utilizing critics during inference further gives another 4.5% boost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Show, Adapt and Tell: Adversarial Training of Cross-Domain Image Captioner","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.64","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237326.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Show, Adapt and Tell: Adversarial Training of Cross-Domain Image Captioner","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237326/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453077","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Show, Adapt and Tell: Adversarial Training of Cross-Domain Image Captioner","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121957S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237329,"authors":[{"name":"Elad Osherov","affiliation":["Technion, Israel"],"firstName":"Elad","lastName":"Osherov","id":"37086284532"},{"name":"Michael Lindenbaum","affiliation":["Technion, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lindenbaum","id":"37282971500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237329","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Training","Entropy","Kernel","Weight measurement","Visualization","Tensile stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image filtering","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN robustness","convolutional neural networks","visual object classification","occlusion conditions","object instances","partial occlusions","spatial support","occlusion robustness","training process","standard classifiers","CNN training","partially occluded object classification","filter support reduction","regularization terms","second central moments","group sparsity","mutually reweighted L1"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide the current state of the art in visual object classification, but they are far less accurate when classifying partially occluded objects. A straightforward way to improve classification under occlusion conditions is to train the classifier using partially occluded object examples. However, training the network on many combinations of object instances and occlusions may be computationally expensive. This work proposes an alternative approach to increasing the robustness of CNNs to occlusion. We start by studying the effect of partial occlusions on the trained CNN and show, empirically, that training on partially occluded examples reduces the spatial support of the filters. Building upon this finding, we argue that smaller filter support is beneficial for occlusion robustness. We propose a training process that uses a special regularization term that acts to shrink the spatial support of the filters. We consider three possible regularization terms that are based on second central moments, group sparsity, and mutually reweighted L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, respectively. When trained on normal (unoccluded) examples, the resulting classifier is highly robust to occlusions.

In this paper, we model the relationship of vehicle images as multiple grains. Following this, we propose two approaches to alleviate the precise vehicle search problem by exploiting multi-grain ranking constraints. One is Generalized Pairwise Ranking, which generalizes the conventional pairwise from considering only binary similar/dissimilar relations to multiple relations. The other is Multi-Grain based List Ranking, which introduces permutation probability to score a permutation of a multi-grain list, and further optimizes the ranking by the likelihood loss function. We implement the two approaches with multi-attribute classification in a multi-task deep learning framework. To further facilitate the research on precise vehicle search, we also contribute two high-quality and well-annotated vehicle datasets, named VD1 and VD2, which are collected from two different cities with diverse annotated attributes. As two of the largest publicly available precise vehicle search datasets, they contain 1,097,649 and 807,260 vehicle images respectively.

To address this, we devise a recurrent scale approximation (RSA) to compute feature map once only, and only through this map can we approximate the rest maps on other levels. At the core of RSA is the recursive rolling out mechanism: given an initial map on a particular scale, it generates the prediction on a smaller scale that is half the size of input. To further increase efficiency and accuracy, we (a): design a scale-forecast network to globally predict potential scales in the image since there is no need to compute maps on all levels of the pyramid. (b): propose a landmark retracing network (LRN) to retrace back locations of the regressed landmarks and generate a confidence score for each landmark; LRN can effectively alleviate false positives due to the accumulated error in RSA. The whole system could be trained end-to-end in a unified CNN framework.

If we define the context of the interaction to be the objects involved, then most current methods can be categorized as either: (i) training a single classifier on the combination of the interaction and its context; or (ii) aiming to recognize the interaction independently of its explicit context. Both methods suffer limitations: the former scales poorly with the number of combinations and fails to generalize to unseen combinations, while the latter often leads to poor interaction recognition performance due to the difficulty of designing a contextindependent interaction classifier.,,To mitigate those drawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, context-aware interaction recognition framework. The key to our method is to explicitly construct an interaction classifier which combines the context, and the interaction. The context is encoded via word2vec into a semantic space, and is used to derive a classification result for the interaction. The proposed method still builds one classifier for one interaction (as per type (ii) above), but the classifier built is adaptive to context via weights which are context dependent. The benefit of using the semantic space is that it naturally leads to zero-shot generalizations in which semantically similar contexts (subject-object pairs) can be recognized as suitable contexts for an interaction, even if they were not observed in the training set. Our method also scales with the number of interaction-context pairs since our model parameters do not increase with the number of interactions. Thus our method avoids the limitation of both approaches. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed framework leads to improved performance for all investigated interaction representations and datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17467784","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237333/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Towards Context-Aware Interaction Recognition for Visual Relationship Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Context-Aware Interaction Recognition for Visual Relationship Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071169S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":8237335,"authors":[{"name":"Relja Arandjelovic","affiliation":["DeepMind"],"firstName":"Relja","lastName":"Arandjelovic","id":"38546766500"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["DeepMind","Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237335","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":492},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Training","Semantics","Feature extraction","Dogs","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-of-the-art","sound classification benchmarks","fine-grained recognition tasks","unlabelled videos","audio streams","novel Audio-Visual Correspondence","audio networks","raw unconstrained videos","audio representations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237335","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237335.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Look, Listen and Learn","abstract":"We consider the question: what can be learnt by looking at and listening to a large number of unlabelled videos?

We also demonstrate that the network is able to localize objects in both modalities, as well as perform fine-grained recognition tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237335/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467855","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Look, Listen and Learn","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Look, Listen and Learn","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10554S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8237336,"authors":[{"name":"Ramprasaath R.

Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for `dog' or even a caption), flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad- CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a `stronger' deep network from a `weaker' one even when both make identical predictions.

Although many studies exist for learning a generic or universal aesthetics model, investigation of aesthetics models incorporating individual user's preference is quite limited. We address this personalized aesthetics problem by showing that individual's aesthetic preferences exhibit strong correlations with content and aesthetic attributes, and hence the deviation of individual's perception from generic image aesthetics is predictable. To accommodate our study, we first collect two distinct datasets, a large image dataset from Flickr and annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk, and a small dataset of real personal albums rated by owners. We then propose a new approach to personalized aesthetics learning that can be trained even with a small set of annotated images from a user. The approach is based on a residual-based model adaptation scheme which learns an offset to compensate for the generic aesthetics score. Finally, we introduce an active learning algorithm to optimize personalized aesthetics prediction for real-world application scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively learn personalized aesthetics preferences, and outperforms existing methods on quantitative comparisons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237338/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237338/","accessionNumber":"17452963","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Personalized Image Aesthetics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized Image Aesthetics","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08291S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237340,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wen","affiliation":["University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085427457"},{"name":"Cong Xu","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Labs"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086263844"},{"name":"Chunpeng Wu","affiliation":["University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Chunpeng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085448259"},{"name":"Yandan Wang","affiliation":["University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Yandan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085636558"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086008915"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Duke University"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37086265672"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237340","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Correlation","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Hardware","Tensile stress","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image classification","image filtering","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinating filters","computer vision tasks","Low-Rank Approximations","Force Regularization","standard LRA methods","deep neural networks","pre-trained DNNs","image classification tasks"]}],"abstract":"Very large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable successes in a large variety of computer vision tasks. However, the high computation intensity of DNNs makes it challenging to deploy these models on resource-limited systems. Some studies used low-rank approaches that approximate the filters by low-rank basis to accelerate the testing. Those works directly decomposed the pre-trained DNNs by Low-Rank Approximations (LRA). How to train DNNs toward lower-rank space for more efficient DNNs, however, remains as an open area. To solve the issue, in this work, we propose Force Regularization, which uses attractive forces to enforce filters so as to coordinate more weight information into lower-rank space\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n. We mathematically and empirically verify that after applying our technique, standard LRA methods can reconstruct filters using much lower basis and thus result in faster DNNs. The effectiveness of our approach is comprehensively evaluated in ResNets, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet. In AlexNet, for example, Force Regularization gains 2\u00d7 speedup on modern GPU without accuracy loss and 4:05\u00d7 speedup on CPU by paying small accuracy degradation. Moreover, Force Regularization better initializes the low-rank DNNs such that the fine-tuning can converge faster toward higher accuracy. The obtained lower-rank DNNs can be further sparsified, proving that Force Regularization can be integrated with state-of-the-art sparsity-based acceleration methods.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237340.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinating Filters for Faster Deep Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.78","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Coordinating Filters for Faster Deep Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453119","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237340/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinating Filters for Faster Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089463S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237343,"authors":[{"name":"Jingchun Cheng","affiliation":["University of California, Merced","Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Jingchun","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086314208"},{"name":"Yi-Hsuan Tsai","affiliation":["University of California, Merced","NEC Laboratories America"],"firstName":"Yi-Hsuan","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37085759166"},{"name":"Shengjin Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Shengjin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085762582"},{"name":"Ming-Hsuan Yang","affiliation":["University of California, Merced","NVIDIA Research"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085407860"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237343","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237343","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Object segmentation","Image segmentation","Optical fiber networks","Training","Optical propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional network","optical flow branch","image segmentation task","segmentation branch","pixel-wise object segmentation","end-to-end trainable network","video object segmentation","SegFlow"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable network, SegFlow, for simultaneously predicting pixel-wise object segmentation and optical flow in videos.

Direct regression performs boundary regression by predicting the offsets from a given point, while indirect regression predicts the offsets from some bounding box proposals. In the context of multioriented scene text detection, we analyze the drawbacks of indirect regression, which covers the state-of-the-art detection structures Faster-RCNN and SSD as instances, and point out the potential superiority of direct regression. To verify this point of view, we propose a deep direct regression based method for multi-oriented scene text detection. Our detection framework is simple and effective with a fully convolutional network and one-step post processing. The fully convolutional network is optimized in an end-to-end way and has bi-task outputs where one is pixel-wise classification between text and non-text, and the other is direct regression to determine the vertex coordinates of quadrilateral text boundaries. The proposed method is particularly beneficial to localize incidental scene texts. On the ICDAR2015 Incidental Scene Text benchmark, our method achieves the F-measure of 81%, which is a new state-ofthe-art and significantly outperforms previous approaches. On other standard datasets with focused scene texts, our method also reaches the state-of-the-art performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.87","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237349.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Direct Regression for Multi-oriented Scene Text Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep Direct Regression for Multi-oriented Scene Text Detection","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237349/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237349/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Direct Regression for Multi-oriented Scene Text Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100288S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237350,"authors":[{"name":"Pau Panareda Busto","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group, University of Bonn, Germany","Airbus Group Innovations, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Pau Panareda","lastName":"Busto","id":"37086282303"},{"name":"Juergen Gall","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group, University of Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Gall","id":"37393846400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237350","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Protocols","Computer vision","Automobiles","Dogs","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["set domain adaptation","test data","object classifier","closed set recognition task","open sets","target data","closed set scenarios","open set scenarios","target domain","source dataset","evaluation protocols","object classes","domain shift"]}],"abstract":"When the training and the test data belong to different domains, the accuracy of an object classifier is significantly reduced. Therefore, several algorithms have been proposed in the last years to diminish the so called domain shift between datasets. However, all available evaluation protocols for domain adaptation describe a closed set recognition task, where both domains, namely source and target, contain exactly the same object classes. In this work, we also explore the field of domain adaptation in open sets, which is a more realistic scenario where only a few categories of interest are shared between source and target data. Therefore, we propose a method that fits in both closed and open set scenarios. The approach learns a mapping from the source to the target domain by jointly solving an assignment problem that labels those target instances that potentially belong to the categories of interest present in the source dataset. A thorough evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.88","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237350.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open Set Domain Adaptation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237350/","displayDocTitle":"Open Set Domain Adaptation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453273","htmlLink":"/document/8237350/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open Set Domain Adaptation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.197035S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237351,"authors":[{"name":"Jifeng Dai","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Jifeng","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085684504"},{"name":"Haozhi Qi","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Haozhi","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086256199"},{"name":"Yuwen Xiong","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Yuwen","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37086227134"},{"name":"Yi Li","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086261640"},{"name":"Guodong Zhang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086278448"},{"name":"Han Hu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086282615"},{"name":"Yichen Wei","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Yichen","lastName":"Wei","id":"38184495900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237351","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":651,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2383},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237351","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Kernel","Object detection","Standards","Feature extraction","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","feedforward neural nets","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformable convolutional networks","convolutional neural networks","geometric transformations","fixed geometric structures","transformation modeling capability","deformable convolution","deformable RoI pooling","spatial sampling locations","dense spatial transformation","deep CNN","standard back-propagation"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently limited to model geometric transformations due to the fixed geometric structures in their building modules.

Whereas, great efforts are also devoted to similarity (or metric) fusion, seeing that only one individual type of similarity cannot fully reveal the intrinsic relationship between objects. This stimulates a great research interest of considering similarity fusion in the framework of diffusion process (i.e., fusion with diffusion) for robust retrieval. In this paper, we firstly revisit representative methods about fusion with diffusion, and provide new insights which are ignored by previous researchers. Then, observing that existing algorithms are susceptible to noisy similarities, the proposed Regularized Ensemble Diffusion (RED) is bundled with an automatic weight learning paradigm, so that the negative impacts of noisy similarities are suppressed. At last, we integrate several recently-proposed similarities with the proposed framework. The experimental results suggest that we can achieve new state-of-the-art performances on various retrieval tasks, including 3D shape retrieval on ModelNet dataset, and image retrieval on Holidays and Ukbench dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.90","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237352.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble Diffusion for Retrieval","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237352/","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble Diffusion for Retrieval","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453036","htmlLink":"/document/8237352/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble Diffusion for Retrieval","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.189268S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237355,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghang Hu","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Ronghang","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085806786"},{"name":"Jacob Andreas","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Andreas","id":"37086189394"},{"name":"Marcus Rohrbach","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research","University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Rohrbach","id":"37547737000"},{"name":"Trevor Darrell","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Darrell","id":"37282910600"},{"name":"Kate Saenko","affiliation":["Boston University"],"firstName":"Kate","lastName":"Saenko","id":"37298968800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237355","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Visualization","Knowledge discovery","Cognition","Predictive models","Neural networks","Pragmatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","grammars","natural language processing","neural net architecture","question answering (information retrieval)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linguistic substructures","end-to-end module networks","N2NMNs","instance-specific network layouts","network structures","network parameters","visual question answering","natural language questions","compositional question answering","Neural Module Network architecture","question-specific deep networks","parsers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237355","abstract":"Natural language questions are inherently compositional, and many are most easily answered by reasoning about their decomposition into modular sub-problems. For example, to answer \u201cis there an equal number of balls and boxes?\u201d we can look for balls, look for boxes, count them, and compare the results. The recently proposed Neural Module Network (NMN) architecture [3, 2] implements this approach to question answering by parsing questions into linguistic substructures and assembling question-specific deep networks from smaller modules that each solve one subtask. However, existing NMN implementations rely on brittle off-the-shelf parsers, and are restricted to the module configurations proposed by these parsers rather than learning them from data. In this paper, we propose End-to-End Module Networks (N2NMNs), which learn to reason by directly predicting instance-specific network layouts without the aid of a parser. Our model learns to generate network structures (by imitating expert demonstrations) while simultaneously learning network parameters (using the downstream task loss). Experimental results on the new CLEVR dataset targeted at compositional question answering show that N2NMNs achieve an error reduction of nearly 50% relative to state-of-the-art attentional approaches, while discovering interpretable network architectures specialized for each question.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.93","startPage":"804","endPage":"813","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237355.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Reason: End-to-End Module Networks for Visual Question Answering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Reason: End-to-End Module Networks for Visual Question Answering","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237355/","accessionNumber":"17453202","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237355/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Reason: End-to-End Module Networks for Visual Question Answering","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115231S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":8237356,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhui Yuan","affiliation":["Microsoft Research","Key Laboratory of Machine Perception(MOE), Peking University"],"firstName":"Yuhui","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37086314989"},{"name":"Kuiyuan Yang","affiliation":["DeepMotion"],"firstName":"Kuiyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086315238"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception(MOE), Peking University","Cooperarive Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086311809"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237356","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Adaptation models","Training","Complexity theory","Measurement","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural networks","deep metric learning","triplet network","Siamese network","quadratic sample size","cubic sample size","Hard example mining","complex models","diverse hard levels","different complexities","cascaded manner","increasing complexities","updates models","Hard-Aware Deeply Cascaded Embedding","HDC","CARS196","CUB-200-2011","Stanford Online Products","VehicleID","DeepFashion datasets"]}],"abstract":"Riding on the waves of deep neural networks, deep metric learning has achieved promising results in various tasks by using triplet network or Siamese network. Though the basic goal of making images from the same category closer than the ones from different categories is intuitive, it is hard to optimize the objective directly due to the quadratic or cubic sample size. Hard example mining is widely used to solve the problem, which spends the expensive computation on a subset of samples that are considered hard. However, hard is defined relative to a specific model. Then complex models will treat most samples as easy ones and vice versa for simple models, both of which are not good for training. It is difficult to define a model with the just right complexity and choose hard examples adequately as different samples are of diverse hard levels. This motivates us to propose the novel framework named Hard-Aware Deeply Cascaded Embedding(HDC) to ensemble a set of models with different complexities in cascaded manner to mine hard examples at multiple levels. A sample is judged by a series of models with increasing complexities and only updates models that consider the sample as a hard case. The HDC is evaluated on CARS196, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Online Products, VehicleID and DeepFashion datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.94","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237356.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hard-Aware Deeply Cascaded Embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237356/","displayDocTitle":"Hard-Aware Deeply Cascaded Embedding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453163","htmlLink":"/document/8237356/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hard-Aware Deeply Cascaded Embedding","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a814.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091358S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8237359,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Sun","affiliation":["Google Research"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086270561"},{"name":"Abhinav Shrivastava","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University","Google Research"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37085697077"},{"name":"Saurabh Singh","affiliation":["Google Research"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086264198"},{"name":"Abhinav Gupta","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University","Google Research"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37291130800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237359","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":741},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Visualization","Computational modeling","Data models","Training data","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","learning (artificial intelligence)","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision community","base model","training data size","vision tasks increases","representation learning","JFT-300M dataset","visual deep learning","dataset size","large-scale labeled data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237359","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237359.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.97","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data in Deep Learning Era","abstract":"The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10\u00d7 or 100\u00d7? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237359/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17467929","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data in Deep Learning Era","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data in Deep Learning Era","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117922S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237361,"authors":[{"name":"Roman Klokov","affiliation":["Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Klokov","id":"37086294793"},{"name":"Victor Lempitsky","affiliation":["Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lempitsky","id":"37332794000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237361","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":208,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":876},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Solid modeling","Computer architecture","Two dimensional displays","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","shape recognition","solid modelling","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep Kd-networks","3D point cloud models","deep learning architecture","unstructured point clouds","three-dimensional grids","shape recognition tasks","shape retrieval","shape part segmentation","multiplicative transformations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237361","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237361.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.99","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Escape from Cells: Deep Kd-Networks for the Recognition of 3D Point Cloud Models","abstract":"We present a new deep learning architecture (called Kdnetwork) that is designed for 3D model recognition tasks and works with unstructured point clouds.

Hardware vision acceleration, however, does not address the cost of capturing and processing the image data that feeds these algorithms. We examine the role of the image signal processing (ISP) pipeline in computer vision to identify opportunities to reduce computation and save energy. The key insight is that imaging pipelines should be be configurable: to switch between a traditional photography mode and a low-power vision mode that produces lower-quality image data suitable only for computer vision. We use eight computer vision algorithms and a reversible pipeline simulation tool to study the imaging system's impact on vision performance. For both CNN-based and classical vision algorithms, we observe that only two ISP stages, demosaicing and gamma compression, are critical for task performance. We propose a new image sensor design that can compensate for these stages. The sensor design features an adjustable resolution and tunable analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our proposed imaging system's vision mode disables the ISP entirely and configures the sensor to produce subsampled, lower-precision image data. This vision mode can save ~75% of the average energy of a baseline photography mode with only a small impact on vision task accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.111","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"975","endPage":"984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfiguring the Imaging Pipeline for Computer Vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconfiguring the Imaging Pipeline for Computer Vision","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237373/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17482286","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237373/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfiguring the Imaging Pipeline for Computer Vision","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080336S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237375,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Xing Yu","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing, Guangzhou, China","School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Xing","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086286121"},{"name":"Ancong Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Ancong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085747981"},{"name":"Wei-Shi Zheng","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of High Performance Computing, NUDT, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Intelligence and Advanced Computing, China","School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Shi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37399449200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Cameras","Data models","Training","Linear programming","Interference","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image matching","object detection","pattern clustering","pedestrians","traffic engineering computing","unsupervised learning","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera views","cross-view asymmetric metric learning","unsupervised person reidentification","unsupervised asymmetric metric learning","cross-view pedestrian matching","visual surveillance","large-scale unlabelled RE-ID dataset","view-specific bias","asymmetric clustering"]}],"abstract":"While metric learning is important for Person reidentification (RE-ID), a significant problem in visual surveillance for cross-view pedestrian matching, existing metric models for RE-ID are mostly based on supervised learning that requires quantities of labeled samples in all pairs of camera views for training. However, this limits their scalabilities to realistic applications, in which a large amount of data over multiple disjoint camera views is available but not labelled. To overcome the problem, we propose unsupervised asymmetric metric learning for unsupervised RE-ID. Our model aims to learn an asymmetric metric, i.e., specific projection for each view, based on asymmetric clustering on cross-view person images. Our model finds a shared space where view-specific bias is alleviated and thus better matching performance can be achieved. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a baseline and five large-scale RE-ID datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Through the comparison, we show that our model works much more suitable for unsupervised RE-ID compared to classical unsupervised metric learning models. We also compare with existing unsupervised REID methods, and our model outperforms them with notable margins. Specifically, we report the results on large-scale unlabelled RE-ID dataset, which is important but unfortunately less concerned in literatures.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.113","startPage":"994","endPage":"1002","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237375.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-View Asymmetric Metric Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237375/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cross-View Asymmetric Metric Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453288","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-View Asymmetric Metric Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032a994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078116S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237377,"authors":[{"name":"Inwoong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Inwoong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086302590"},{"name":"Doyoung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Doyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086036881"},{"name":"Seoungyoon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seoungyoon","lastName":"Kang","id":"37086299972"},{"name":"Sanghoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085403015"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237377","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":83,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":912},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble Deep Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition Using Temporal Sliding LSTM Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237377.pdf","startPage":"1012","endPage":"1020","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skeleton","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Three-dimensional displays","Hip","Machine learning","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image motion analysis","image recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["action recognition","feature representation","skeleton joints","temporal dynamics","human actions","relative coordinate systems","long-term dependency","raw skeletons","salient motion features","temporal dependencies","temporal features","multiterm TS-LSTM features","softmax features","long short-term memory networks","ensemble deep learning","short-term dependency","medium term dependency","ensemble temporal sliding LSTM networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237377","abstract":"This paper addresses the problems of feature representation of skeleton joints and the modeling of temporal dynamics to recognize human actions. Traditional methods generally use relative coordinate systems dependent on some joints, and model only the long-term dependency, while excluding short-term and medium term dependencies. Instead of taking raw skeletons as the input, we transform the skeletons into another coordinate system to obtain the robustness to scale, rotation and translation, and then extract salient motion features from them. Considering that Long Shortterm Memory (LSTM) networks with various time-step sizes can model various attributes well, we propose novel ensemble Temporal Sliding LSTM (TS-LSTM) networks for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed network is composed of multiple parts containing short-term, mediumterm and long-term TS-LSTM networks, respectively. In our network, we utilize an average ensemble among multiple parts as a final feature to capture various temporal dependencies. We evaluate the proposed networks and the additional other architectures to verify the effectiveness of the proposed networks, and also compare them with several other methods on five challenging datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network models achieve the state-of-the-art performance through various temporal features.

Current systems often assume the availability of multiple facial images (sometimes from the same subject) as input, and must address a number of methodological challenges such as establishing dense correspondences across large facial poses, expressions, and non-uniform illumination. In general these methods require complex and inefficient pipelines for model building and fitting. In this work, we propose to address many of these limitations by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an appropriate dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D facial models or scans. Our CNN works with just a single 2D facial image, does not require accurate alignment nor establishes dense correspondence between images, works for arbitrary facial poses and expressions, and can be used to reconstruct the whole 3D facial geometry (including the non-visible parts of the face) bypassing the construction (during training) and fitting (during testing) of a 3D Morphable Model. We achieve this via a simple CNN architecture that performs direct regression of a volumetric representation of the 3D facial geometry from a single 2D image. We also demonstrate how the related task of facial landmark localization can be incorporated into the proposed framework and help improve reconstruction quality, especially for the cases of large poses and facial expressions.

To address the problem of limited IQA dataset size, we train a Siamese Network to rank images in terms of image quality by using synthetically generated distortions for which relative image quality is known. These ranked image sets can be automatically generated without laborious human labeling. We then use fine-tuning to transfer the knowledge represented in the trained Siamese Network to a traditional CNN that estimates absolute image quality from single images. We demonstrate how our approach can be made significantly more efficient than traditional Siamese Networks by forward propagating a batch of images through a single network and backpropagating gradients derived from all pairs of images in the batch. Experiments on the TID2013 benchmark show that we improve the state-of-theart by over 5%. Furthermore, on the LIVE benchmark we show that our approach is superior to existing NR-IQA techniques and that we even outperform the state-of-the-art in full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) methods without having to resort to high-quality reference images to infer IQA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RankIQA: Learning from Rankings for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.118","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237380.pdf","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"RankIQA: Learning from Rankings for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237380/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453165","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RankIQA: Learning from Rankings for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116885S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237381,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowu Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Xiaowu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403978800"},{"name":"Anlin Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Anlin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086242924"},{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["International Research Institute for Multidisciplinary Science, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Li","id":"37086323055"},{"name":"Feng Lu","affiliation":["International Research Institute for Multidisciplinary Science, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"38238221900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237381","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Feature extraction","Semantics","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manually annotated salient objects","inception-segmentation module","semantic perception","proper architecture","semantic tags","semantic stream","fixation prediction","eye-tracking data","fixation stream","two-stream CNNs","eye-tracking experiments","semantic objects","two-stream fixation-semantic CNNs","SOD","salient object detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237381.pdf","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Look, Perceive and Segment: Finding the Salient Objects in Images via Two-stream Fixation-Semantic CNNs","abstract":"Recently, CNN-based models have achieved remarkable success in image-based salient object detection (SOD). In these models, a key issue is to find a proper network architecture that best fits for the task of SOD. Toward this end, this paper proposes two-stream fixation-semantic CNNs, whose architecture is inspired by the fact that salient objects in complex images can be unambiguously annotated by selecting the pre-segmented semantic objects that receive the highest fixation density in eye-tracking experiments. In the two-stream CNNs, a fixation stream is pre-trained on eye-tracking data whose architecture well fits for the task of fixation prediction, and a semantic stream is pre-trained on images with semantic tags that has a proper architecture for semantic perception. By fusing these two streams into an inception-segmentation module and jointly fine-tuning them on images with manually annotated salient objects, the proposed networks show impressive performance in segmenting salient objects.

While existing algorithms mainly focus on developing image priors for blur kernel estimation and non-blind deconvolution, only a few methods consider the effect of data fitting functions. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods that use a single or a fixed data fitting term, we propose a data-driven approach to learn effective data fitting functions from a large set of motion blurred images with the associated ground truth blur kernels. The learned data fitting function facilitates estimating accurate blur kernels for generic scenes and domain-specific problems with corresponding image priors. In addition, we extend the learning approach for data fitting function to latent image restoration and nonuniform deblurring. Extensive experiments on challenging motion blurred images demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237384.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1085","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Discriminative Data Fitting Functions for Blind Image Deblurring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Estimation","Image restoration","Deconvolution","Optimization","Convolution","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","image motion analysis","image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind image deblurring","blur kernel estimation","fixed data fitting term","data-driven approach","effective data","motion blurred images","latent image restoration","nonuniform deblurring","image priors","discriminative data fitting function learning","nonblind deconvolution","generic scenes","domain-specific problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Discriminative Data Fitting Functions for Blind Image Deblurring","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237384/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467744","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Discriminative Data Fitting Functions for Blind Image Deblurring","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082985S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237385,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqi Ren","affiliation":["Tencent AI Lab","IIE, State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS)"],"firstName":"Wenqi","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085379197"},{"name":"Jinshan Pan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jinshan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37070435400"},{"name":"Xiaochun Cao","affiliation":["IIE, State Key Laboratory of Information Security (SKLOIS)","School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Cao","id":"37276620300"},{"name":"Ming-Hsuan Yang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Merced"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37277304600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237385","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237385","abstract":"Video deblurring is a challenging problem as the blur is complex and usually caused by the combination of camera shakes, object motions, and depth variations. Optical flow can be used for kernel estimation since it predicts motion trajectories. However, the estimates are often inaccurate in complex scenes at object boundaries, which are crucial in kernel estimation. In this paper, we exploit semantic segmentation in each blurry frame to understand the scene contents and use different motion models for image regions to guide optical flow estimation. While existing pixel-wise blur models assume that the blur kernel is the same as optical flow during the exposure time, this assumption does not hold when the motion blur trajectory at a pixel is different from the estimated linear optical flow. We analyze the relationship between motion blur trajectory and optical flow, and present a novel pixel-wise non-linear kernel model to account for motion blur. The proposed blur model is based on the non-linear optical flow, which describes complex motion blur more effectively. Extensive experiments on challenging blurry videos demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.123","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1094","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237385.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Deblurring via Semantic Segmentation and Pixel-Wise Non-linear Kernel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Nonlinear optics","Kernel","Motion segmentation","Optical vortices","Image segmentation","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image restoration","image segmentation","image sequences","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex motion blur","nonlinear optical flow","blur model","nonlinear kernel model","estimated linear optical flow","motion blur trajectory","blur kernel","pixel-wise blur models","optical flow estimation","different motion models","object boundaries","complex scenes","motion trajectories","kernel estimation","depth variations","object motions","camera shakes","pixel-wise nonlinear kernel","semantic segmentation","video deblurring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Video Deblurring via Semantic Segmentation and Pixel-Wise Non-linear Kernel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237385/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453241","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Deblurring via Semantic Segmentation and Pixel-Wise Non-linear Kernel","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092819S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237387,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085658303"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085357527"},{"name":"David Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085519931"},{"name":"Xiangchu Feng","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiangchu","lastName":"Feng","id":"37335387400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237387","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":592},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Color","Noise measurement","Image color analysis","Colored noise","Gray-scale","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image denoising","minimisation","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise statistics","multichannel optimization model","grayscale images","color image denoising","multichannel weighted nuclear norm minimization","real noisy image datasets","synthetic image datasets","MC-WNNM model","channel redundancy"]}],"abstract":"Most of the existing denoising algorithms are developed for grayscale images. It is not trivial to extend them for color image denoising since the noise statistics in R, G, and B channels can be very different for real noisy images. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel (MC) optimization model for real color image denoising under the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) framework. We concatenate the RGB patches to make use of the channel redundancy, and introduce a weight matrix to balance the data fidelity of the three channels in consideration of their different noise statistics. The proposed MC-WNNM model does not have an analytical solution. We reformulate it into a linear equality-constrained problem and solve it via alternating direction method of multipliers. Each alternative updating step has a closed-form solution and the convergence can be guaranteed. Experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MC-WNNM over state-of-the-art denoising methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization for Real Color Image Denoising","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.125","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237387.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization for Real Color Image Denoising","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237387/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453201","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization for Real Color Image Denoising","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101673S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237390,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Kiani Galoogahi","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Hamed Kiani","lastName":"Galoogahi","id":"37990667000"},{"name":"Ashton Fagg","affiliation":["SAIVT Lab, Queensland University of Technology"],"firstName":"Ashton","lastName":"Fagg","id":"37086046781"},{"name":"Chen Huang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086276968"},{"name":"Deva Ramanan","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Deva","lastName":"Ramanan","id":"37393712400"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237390","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237390","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Cameras","Object tracking","Correlation","Benchmark testing","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","filtering theory","image sequences","object detection","object tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking accuracy","real-time performance","higher frame rate acquisition","higher frame rate object tracking","higher frame rate video dataset","visual object tracking","visual attributes","higher frame rate sequences","Need-for-Speed","NfS","occlusion","fast motion","background clutter","correlation filters","bandwidth constraints"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose the first higher frame rate video dataset (called Need for Speed - NfS) and benchmark for visual object tracking. The dataset consists of 100 videos (380K frames) captured with now commonly available higher frame rate (240 FPS) cameras from real world scenarios. All frames are annotated with axis aligned bounding boxes and all sequences are manually labelled with nine visual attributes - such as occlusion, fast motion, background clutter, etc. Our benchmark provides an extensive evaluation of many recent and state-of-the-art trackers on higher frame rate sequences. We ranked each of these trackers according to their tracking accuracy and real-time performance. One of our surprising conclusions is that at higher frame rates, simple trackers such as correlation filters outperform complex methods based on deep networks. This suggests that for practical applications (such as in robotics or embedded vision), one needs to carefully tradeoff bandwidth constraints associated with higher frame rate acquisition, computational costs of real-time analysis, and the required application accuracy. Our dataset and benchmark allows for the first time (to our knowledge) systematic exploration of such issues, and will be made available to allow for further research in this space.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.128","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237390.pdf","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Need for Speed: A Benchmark for Higher Frame Rate Object Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Need for Speed: A Benchmark for Higher Frame Rate Object Tracking","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237390/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467896","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237390/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Need for Speed: A Benchmark for Higher Frame Rate Object Tracking","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121962S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237391,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Kiani Galoogahi","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Hamed Kiani","lastName":"Galoogahi","id":"37990667000"},{"name":"Ashton Fagg","affiliation":["SAIVT Lab, Queensland University of Technology"],"firstName":"Ashton","lastName":"Fagg","id":"37086046781"},{"name":"Simon Lucey","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey","id":"37266130100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237391","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":260,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":937},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237391","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Correlation","Training","Visualization","Real-time systems","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","feature extraction","image filtering","learning (artificial intelligence)","object tracking","photometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual tracking","geometric variations","suboptimal performance","discriminative deep features","high-end GPUs","Background-Aware CF","hand-crafted features","photometric variations","background-aware correlation filters","deep tracking frameworks","object foreground","object background"]}],"abstract":"Correlation Filters (CFs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance in terms of rapidly tracking objects under challenging photometric and geometric variations. The strength of the approach comes from its ability to efficiently learn - on the fly - how the object is changing over time. A fundamental drawback to CFs, however, is that the background of the target is not modeled over time which can result in suboptimal performance. Recent tracking algorithms have suggested to resolve this drawback by either learning CFs from more discriminative deep features (e.g. DeepSRDCF [9] and CCOT [11]) or learning complex deep trackers (e.g. MDNet [28] and FCNT [33]). While such methods have been shown to work well, they suffer from high complexity: extracting deep features or applying deep tracking frameworks is very computationally expensive. This limits the real-time performance of such methods, even on high-end GPUs. This work proposes a Background-Aware CF based on hand-crafted features (HOG [6]) that can efficiently model how both the foreground and background of the object varies over time. Our approach, like conventional CFs, is extremely computationally efficient- and extensive experiments over multiple tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superior accuracy and real-time performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art trackers.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.129","startPage":"1144","endPage":"1152","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237391.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Background-Aware Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237391/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Background-Aware Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453296","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237391/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Background-Aware Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110037S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237397,"authors":[{"name":"Yinda Zhang","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Yinda","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088457884"},{"name":"Mingru Bai","affiliation":["Princeton University"],"firstName":"Mingru","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086266620"},{"name":"Pushmeet Kohli","affiliation":["Microsoft Research","DeepMind"],"firstName":"Pushmeet","lastName":"Kohli","id":"37408096000"},{"name":"Shahram Izadi","affiliation":["Microsoft Research","PerceptiveIO"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Izadi","id":"37550144200"},{"name":"Jianxiong Xiao","affiliation":["AutoX","Princeton University"],"firstName":"Jianxiong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085433858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237397","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237397","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Context modeling","Neural networks","Training data","Data models","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","convolution","neural nets","object detection","object recognition","rendering (computer graphics)","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-encoding neural pathways","deep neural network architectures","3D convolutional neural network","local object information","objects recognition","3D holistic scene understanding","context information integration","neural network topology","3D scene template","partially synthetic depth images rendering","CAD models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.135","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237397.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeepContext: Context-Encoding Neural Pathways for 3D Holistic Scene Understanding","abstract":"3D context has been shown to be extremely important for scene understanding, yet very little research has been done on integrating context information with deep neural network architectures.

Given a depth image depicting a 3D scene, our network aligns the observed scene with a predefined 3D scene template, and then reasons about the existence and location of each object within the scene template. In doing so, our model recognizes multiple objects in a single forward pass of a 3D convolutional neural network, capturing both global scene and local object information simultaneously.

Under these circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be produced. In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting geometric constraints of joint inter-connectivity. To address the problem by incorporating priors about the structure of human bodies, we propose a novel structure-aware convolutional network to implicitly take such priors into account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning of such constraints is typically challenging. Instead, we design discriminators to distinguish the real poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible ones). If the pose generator (G) generates results that the discriminator fails to distinguish from real ones, the network successfully learns the priors.,,To better capture the structure dependency of human body joints, the generator G is designed in a stacked multi-task manner to predict poses as well as occlusion heatmaps. Then, the pose and occlusion heatmaps are sent to the discriminators to predict the likelihood of the pose being real. Training of the network follows the strategy of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The effectiveness of the proposed network is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmark datasets. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and almost always generates plausible human pose predictions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.137","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237399.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial PoseNet: A Structure-Aware Convolutional Network for Human Pose Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial PoseNet: A Structure-Aware Convolutional Network for Human Pose Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237399/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467894","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237399/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial PoseNet: A Structure-Aware Convolutional Network for Human Pose Estimation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101334S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237400,"authors":[{"name":"Jiuxiang Gu","affiliation":["ROSE Lab, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiuxiang","lastName":"Gu","id":"37086285931"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Alibaba AI Labs, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086287310"},{"name":"Jianfei Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jianfei","lastName":"Cai","id":"37291518400"},{"name":"Tsuhan Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tsuhan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086286038"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237400","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Convolution","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Recurrent neural networks","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["language models","recurrent neural networks","language CNN model","statistical language modeling tasks","image captioning","history words","vanilla recurrent neural network","image caption generation tasks"]}],"abstract":"Language models based on recurrent neural networks have dominated recent image caption generation tasks.

Our approach models the dependencies between image regions, caption words, and the state of an RNN language model, using three pairwise interactions. In contrast to previous attentionbased approaches that associate image regions only to the RNN state, our method allows a direct association between caption words and image regions. During training these associations are inferred from image-level captions, akin to weakly-supervised object detector training. These associations help to improve captioning by localizing the corresponding regions during testing. We also propose and compare different ways of generating attention areas: CNN activation grids, object proposals, and spatial transformers nets applied in a convolutional fashion. Spatial transformers give the best results. They allow for image specific attention areas, and can be trained jointly with the rest of the network. Our attention mechanism and spatial transformer attention areas together yield state-of-the-art results on the MSCOCO dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.140","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237402.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Areas of Attention for Image Captioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Areas of Attention for Image Captioning","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237402/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452975","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237402/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Areas of Attention for Image Captioning","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127941S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237406,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085706554"},{"name":"Shuang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086224709"},{"name":"Wanli Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, The University of Sydney"],"firstName":"Wanli","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37392356500"},{"name":"Hongsheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hongsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37067578200"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237406","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pose estimation","Semantics","Convolution","Training","Visualization","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","feature extraction","image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["articulated human pose estimation","subsampling ratios","weight initialization scheme","multibranch network structures","plain networks","multibranch networks","convolutional filters","PRMs","Pyramid Residual Module","DCNNs","deep convolutional neural networks","inference time","pyramid methods","severe foreshortening","camera view changes","human body parts","scale variations","computer vision","feature pyramids"]}],"abstract":"Articulated human pose estimation is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. The difficulty is particularly pronounced in scale variations of human body parts when camera view changes or severe foreshortening happens. Although pyramid methods are widely used to handle scale changes at inference time, learning feature pyramids in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) is still not well explored. In this work, we design a Pyramid Residual Module (PRMs) to enhance the invariance in scales of DCNNs. Given input features, the PRMs learn convolutional filters on various scales of input features, which are obtained with different subsampling ratios in a multibranch network. Moreover, we observe that it is inappropriate to adopt existing methods to initialize the weights of multi-branch networks, which achieve superior performance than plain networks in many tasks recently. Therefore, we provide theoretic derivation to extend the current weight initialization scheme to multi-branch network structures. We investigate our method on two standard benchmarks for human pose estimation. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks.

For example, finding a large labeled dataset containing instances in a particular kitchen is unlikely. Each new environment with new instances requires expensive data collection and annotation. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to generate large annotated instance datasets with minimal effort. Our key insight is that ensuring only patch-level realism provides enough training signal for current object detector models. We automatically `cut' object instances and `paste' them on random backgrounds. A naive way to do this results in pixel artifacts which result in poor performance for trained models. We show how to make detectors ignore these artifacts during training and generate data that gives competitive performance on real data. Our method outperforms existing synthesis approaches and when combined with real images improves relative performance by more than 21% on benchmark datasets. In a cross-domain setting, our synthetic data combined with just 10% real data outperforms models trained on all real data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.146","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237408.pdf","startPage":"1310","endPage":"1319","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cut, Paste and Learn: Surprisingly Easy Synthesis for Instance Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cut, Paste and Learn: Surprisingly Easy Synthesis for Instance Detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237408/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453290","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cut, Paste and Learn: Surprisingly Easy Synthesis for Instance Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092374S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":8237409,"authors":[{"name":"Di Lin","affiliation":["Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086112347"},{"name":"Guangyong Chen","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Guangyong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085726158"},{"name":"Daniel Cohen-Or","affiliation":["Tel Aviv University","Shenzhen University"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cohen-Or","id":"38273141800"},{"name":"Pheng-Ann Heng","affiliation":["SIAT","The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Pheng-Ann","lastName":"Heng","id":"37283077400"},{"name":"Hui Huang","affiliation":["Shenzhen University","SIAT"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086110259"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237409","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":751},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Semantics","Image resolution","Silicon","Convolution","Correlation","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image colour analysis","image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic scene segmentation","RGB-D images","fully convolutional network","objects common visual characteristic","scenes common visual characteristic","public datasets","similar scene-resolution","common scene-resolution","neural network","geometric information","depth channel","RGB images","cascaded feature network","relevant contextual information","CaRF","context-aware receptive field"]}],"abstract":"Fully convolutional network (FCN) has been successfully applied in semantic segmentation of scenes represented with RGB images. Images augmented with depth channel provide more understanding of the geometric information of the scene in the image. The question is how to best exploit this additional information to improve the segmentation performance. In this paper, we present a neural network with multiple branches for segmenting RGB-D images. Our approach is to use the available depth to split the image into layers with common visual characteristic of objects/scenes, or common \u201cscene-resolution\u201d. We introduce context-aware receptive field (CaRF) which provides a better control on the relevant contextual information of the learned features. Equipped with CaRF, each branch of the network semantically segments relevant similar scene-resolution, leading to a more focused domain which is easier to learn. Furthermore, our network is cascaded with features from one branch augmenting the features of adjacent branch. We show that such cascading of features enriches the contextual information of each branch and enhances the overall performance. The accuracy that our network achieves outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.147","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237409.pdf","startPage":"1320","endPage":"1328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascaded Feature Network for Semantic Segmentation of RGB-D Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237409/","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded Feature Network for Semantic Segmentation of RGB-D Images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467916","htmlLink":"/document/8237409/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded Feature Network for Semantic Segmentation of RGB-D Images","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072297S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237411,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Wang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085652454"},{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"He","id":"37086274966"},{"name":"Abhinav Gupta","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37291130800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237411","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image edge detection","Videos","Lighting","Feature extraction","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra-instance variations","multitask learning","different viewpoints","richer visual invariance","learned representations","object detection","ImageNet-supervised counterpart","surface normal estimation task","transitive invariance","self-supervised visual representation learning","visual representations","inter-instance variations","invariance useful","auxiliary tasks","computer vision","self-supervised learning","VOC"]}],"abstract":"Learning visual representations with self-supervised learning has become popular in computer vision. The idea is to design auxiliary tasks where labels are free to obtain. Most of these tasks end up providing data to learn specific kinds of invariance useful for recognition. In this paper, we propose to exploit different self-supervised approaches to learn representations invariant to (i) inter-instance variations (two objects in the same class should have similar features) and (ii) intra-instance variations (viewpoint, pose, deformations, illumination, etc.). Instead of combining two approaches with multi-task learning, we argue to organize and reason the data with multiple variations. Specifically, we propose to generate a graph with millions of objects mined from hundreds of thousands of videos. The objects are connected by two types of edges which correspond to two types of invariance: \u201cdifferent instances but a similar viewpoint and category\u201d and \u201cdifferent viewpoints of the same instance\u201d. By applying simple transitivity on the graph with these edges, we can obtain pairs of images exhibiting richer visual invariance. We use this data to train a Triplet-Siamese network with VGG16 as the base architecture and apply the learned representations to different recognition tasks. For object detection, we achieve 63.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 using Fast R-CNN (compare to 67.3% with ImageNet pre-training). For the challenging COCO dataset, our method is surprisingly close (23.5%) to the ImageNet-supervised counterpart (24.4%) using the Faster R-CNN framework. We also show that our network can perform significantly better than the ImageNet network in the surface normal estimation task.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transitive Invariance for Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.149","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237411.pdf","startPage":"1338","endPage":"1347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Transitive Invariance for Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237411/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467921","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transitive Invariance for Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131384S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237414,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086295215"},{"name":"Lingxi Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Lingxi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086292212"},{"name":"Chenxi Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Chenxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086274473"},{"name":"Siyuan Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Siyuan","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37086284205"},{"name":"Ya Zhang","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ya","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086011339"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085688954"},{"name":"Qi Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Tian","id":"37271964500"},{"name":"Alan Yuille","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Yuille","id":"37282960000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237414","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Visualization","Neural networks","Training","Neurons","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","neural nets","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SORT","cross-branch response propagation","transform operations","visual recognition","two-branch network module","element-wise product","Second-Order Response Transform","deep neural networks","second-order operations","residual network","chain-styled network","network architectures"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we reveal the importance and benefits of introducing second-order operations into deep neural networks. We propose a novel approach named Second-Order Response Transform (SORT), which appends element-wise product transform to the linear sum of a two-branch network module. A direct advantage of SORT is to facilitate cross-branch response propagation, so that each branch can update its weights based on the current status of the other branch. Moreover, SORT augments the family of transform operations and increases the nonlinearity of the network, making it possible to learn flexible functions to fit the complicated distribution of feature space. SORT can be applied to a wide range of network architectures, including a branched variant of a chain-styled network and a residual network, with very light-weighted modifications. We observe consistent accuracy gain on both small (CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN) and big (ILSVRC2012) datasets. In addition, SORT is very efficient, as the extra computation overhead is less than 5%.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237414.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SORT: Second-Order Response Transform for Visual Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.152","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"SORT: Second-Order Response Transform for Visual Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453158","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237414/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SORT: Second-Order Response Transform for Visual Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109828S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237415,"authors":[{"name":"Cihang Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Cihang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086285459"},{"name":"Jianyu Wang","affiliation":["Baidu Research USA, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jianyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086292991"},{"name":"Zhishuai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Zhishuai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086290920"},{"name":"Yuyin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Yuyin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086293476"},{"name":"Lingxi Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Lingxi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086292212"},{"name":"Alan Yuille","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Yuille","id":"37085579150"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237415","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":115,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":745},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237415","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Perturbation methods","Proposals","Image segmentation","Semantics","Object detection","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image segmentation","object detection","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense adversary generation","black-box adversarial attack","adversarial perturbations","image classification","deep networks","visually imperceptible perturbations","natural images","object detection","semantic segmentation"]}],"abstract":"It has been well demonstrated that adversarial examples, i.e., natural images with visually imperceptible perturbations added, cause deep networks to fail on image classification. In this paper, we extend adversarial examples to semantic segmentation and object detection which are much more difficult. Our observation is that both segmentation and detection are based on classifying multiple targets on an image (e.g., the target is a pixel or a receptive field in segmentation, and an object proposal in detection). This inspires us to optimize a loss function over a set of targets for generating adversarial perturbations. Based on this, we propose a novel algorithm named Dense Adversary Generation (DAG), which applies to the state-of-the-art networks for segmentation and detection. We find that the adversarial perturbations can be transferred across networks with different training data, based on different architectures, and even for different recognition tasks. In particular, the transfer ability across networks with the same architecture is more significant than in other cases. Besides, we show that summing up heterogeneous perturbations often leads to better transfer performance, which provides an effective method of black-box adversarial attack.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.153","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237415.pdf","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial Examples for Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial Examples for Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237415/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467903","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237415/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial Examples for Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140936S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237416,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxi Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Lingxi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086292212"},{"name":"Alan Yuille","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Yuille","id":"37085579150"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237416","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":123,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1279},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetics","Visualization","Encoding","Training","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","genetic algorithms","image recognition","neural net architecture","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic CNN","deep convolutional neural network","genetic process","standard genetic operations","randomized individuals","fixed-length binary string","network structure","encoding method","search space","genetic algorithm","deep network structures","fixed network architectures","network depth","large-scale visual recognition"]}],"abstract":"The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art solution for large-scale visual recognition. Following some basic principles such as increasing network depth and constructing highway connections, researchers have manually designed a lot of fixed network architectures and verified their effectiveness. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of learning deep network structures automatically. Note that the number of possible network structures increases exponentially with the number of layers in the network, which motivates us to adopt the genetic algorithm to efficiently explore this large search space. The core idea is to propose an encoding method to represent each network structure in a fixed-length binary string. The genetic algorithm is initialized by generating a set of randomized individuals. In each generation, we define standard genetic operations, e.g., selection, mutation and crossover, to generate competitive individuals and eliminate weak ones. The competitiveness of each individual is defined as its recognition accuracy, which is obtained via a standalone training process on a reference dataset. We run the genetic process on CIFAR10, a small-scale dataset, demonstrating its ability to find high-quality structures which are little studied before. The learned powerful structures are also transferrable to the ILSVRC2012 dataset for large-scale visual recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.154","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1397","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237416.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic CNN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237416/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Genetic CNN","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453068","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237416/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic CNN","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138425S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237417,"authors":[{"name":"Yihui He","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yihui","lastName":"He","id":"37086322038"},{"name":"Xiangyu Zhang","affiliation":["Megvii Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086321327"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Megvii Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086322178"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237417","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":378,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1065},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Tensile stress","Optimization","Image reconstruction","Training","Redundancy","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN model training","channel pruning","very deep convolutional neural networks","iterative two-step algorithm","LASSO regression","least square reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new channel pruning method to accelerate very deep convolutional neural networks.

The contextual information of the sentence, as well as visual cues from the video, are important to infer the missing word accurately. Since the source sentence is broken into two fragments: the sentence's left fragment (before the blank) and the sentence's right fragment (after the blank), traditional Recurrent Neural Networks cannot encode this structure accurately because of many possible variations of the missing word in terms of the location and type of the word in the source sentence. For example, a missing word can be the first word or be in the middle of the sentence and it can be a verb or an adjective. In this paper, we propose a framework to tackle the textual encoding: Two separate LSTMs (the LR and RL LSTMs) are employed to encode the left and right sentence fragments and a novel structure is introduced to combine each fragment with an external memory corresponding to the opposite fragments. For the visual encoding, end-to-end spatial and temporal attention models are employed to select discriminative visual representations to find the missing word. In the experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on challenging VFIB problem. Furthermore, we introduce an extended and more generalized version of VFIB, which is not limited to a single blank. Our experiments indicate the generalization capability of our method in dealing with such more realistic scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.157","startPage":"1416","endPage":"1425","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237419.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Fill In the Blank Using LR/RL LSTMs with Spatial-Temporal Attentions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237419/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Video Fill In the Blank Using LR/RL LSTMs with Spatial-Temporal Attentions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237419/","accessionNumber":"17453234","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Fill In the Blank Using LR/RL LSTMs with Spatial-Temporal Attentions","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108434S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237420,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Li","affiliation":["International Research Institute for Multidisciplinary Science, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Li","id":"37085389450"},{"name":"Anlin Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Anlin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086242924"},{"name":"Xiaowu Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Xiaowu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403978800"},{"name":"Bin Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38021654800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237420","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Training","Object segmentation","Image segmentation","Neural networks","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image segmentation","neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neighborhood reversible flow","Complementary Convolutional Neural Networks","backgroundness estimation","video frame","spatial foregroundness","backgroundness maps","video datasets","primary video object segmentation","Complementary CNNs","temporal propagation","annotated salient objects","foregroundness estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approach for segmenting primary video objects by using Complementary Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNN) and neighborhood reversible flow.

By applying CCNN on each video frame, the spatial foregroundness and backgroundness maps can be initialized, which are then propagated between various frames so as to segment primary video objects and suppress distractors. To enforce efficient temporal propagation, we divide each frame into superpixels and construct neighborhood reversible flow that reflects the most reliable temporal correspondences between superpixels in far-away frames. Within such flow, the initialized foregroundness and backgroundness can be efficiently and accurately propagated along the temporal axis so that primary video objects gradually pop-out and distractors are well suppressed. Extensive experimental results on three video datasets show that the proposed approach achieves impressive performance in comparisons with 18 state-of-the-art models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary Video Object Segmentation via Complementary CNNs and Neighborhood Reversible Flow","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.158","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237420.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Primary Video Object Segmentation via Complementary CNNs and Neighborhood Reversible Flow","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237420/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452978","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary Video Object Segmentation via Complementary CNNs and Neighborhood Reversible Flow","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099541S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237427,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Joon Oh","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Seong Joon","lastName":"Oh","id":"37085683731"},{"name":"Mario Fritz","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Fritz","id":"37550243800"},{"name":"Bernt Schiele","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Schiele","id":"37265607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237427","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":584},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237427","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Perturbation methods","Social network services","Robustness","Identification of persons","Privacy","Game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data protection","game theory","image recognition","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["person recognition","personal photo sharing","image processing tactics","automatic identification","social media","game theory","privacy protection","adversarial image perturbation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.165","endPage":"1500","startPage":"1491","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial Image Perturbation for Privacy Protection A Game Theory Perspective","abstract":"Users like sharing personal photos with others through social media. At the same time, they might want to make automatic identification in such photos difficult or even impossible. Classic obfuscation methods such as blurring are not only unpleasant but also not as effective as one would expect [28, 37, 18]. Recent studies on adversarial image perturbations (AIP) suggest that it is possible to confuse recognition systems effectively without unpleasant artifacts. However, in the presence of counter measures against AIPs [7], it is unclear how effective AIP would be in particular when the choice of counter measure is unknown. Game theory provides tools for studying the interaction between agents with uncertainties in the strategies. We introduce a general game theoretical framework for the user-recogniser dynamics, and present a case study that involves current state of the art AIP and person recognition techniques. We derive the optimal strategy for the user that assures an upper bound on the recognition rate independent of the recogniser's counter measure.

In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised scene text detection method (WeText) that trains robust and accurate scene text detection models by learning from unannotated or weakly annotated data. With a \"light\" supervised model trained on a small fully annotated dataset, we explore semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning on a large unannotated dataset and a large weakly annotated dataset, respectively. For the unsupervised learning, the light supervised model is applied to the unannotated dataset to search for more character training samples, which are further combined with the small annotated dataset to retrain a superior character detection model. For the weakly supervised learning, the character searching is guided by high-level annotations of words/text lines that are widely available and also much easier to prepare. In addition, we design an unified scene character detector by adapting regression based deep networks, which greatly relieves the error accumulation issue that widely exists in most traditional approaches. Extensive experiments across different unannotated and weakly annotated datasets show that the scene text detection performance can be clearly boosted under both scenarios, where the weakly supervised learning can achieve the state-of-the-art performance by using only 229 fully annotated scene text images.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.166","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237428.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WeText: Scene Text Detection under Weak Supervision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WeText: Scene Text Detection under Weak Supervision","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237428/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467782","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237428/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WeText: Scene Text Detection under Weak Supervision","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071725S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237429,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Cornell Tech, Cornell University"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086290051"},{"name":"Serge Belongie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Cornell Tech, Cornell University"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Belongie","id":"37326607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237429","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":373,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Optimization","Neural networks","Gallium nitride","Real-time systems","Histograms","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","interpolation","iterative methods","optimisation","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feed-forward neural networks","neural style transfer","arbitrary style transfer","style features","neural algorithm","iterative optimization process","adaptive instance normalization layer","content image rendering","AdaIN layer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237429","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237429.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.167","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-Time with Adaptive Instance Normalization","abstract":"Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content image in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer. However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color & spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237429/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17453281","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237429/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-Time with Adaptive Instance Normalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-Time with Adaptive Instance Normalization","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082863S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"373","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237430,"authors":[{"name":"Qifeng Chen","affiliation":["Intel Labs","Stanford University"],"firstName":"Qifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085338883"},{"name":"Vladlen Koltun","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Vladlen","lastName":"Koltun","id":"37739465900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237430","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":195,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Semantics","Image resolution","Training","Gallium nitride","Image generation","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","image resolution","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photographic image synthesis","cascaded refinement networks","semantic layouts","semantic label map","photographic appearance","two-dimensional semantic specification","single feedforward network","rendering engine","direct regression objective","2-megapixel resolution"]}],"abstract":"We present an approach to synthesizing photographic images conditioned on semantic layouts. Given a semantic label map, our approach produces an image with photographic appearance that conforms to the input layout. The approach thus functions as a rendering engine that takes a two-dimensional semantic specification of the scene and produces a corresponding photographic image. Unlike recent and contemporaneous work, our approach does not rely on adversarial training. We show that photographic images can be synthesized from semantic layouts by a single feedforward network with appropriate structure, trained end-to-end with a direct regression objective. The presented approach scales seamlessly to high resolutions; we demonstrate this by synthesizing photographic images at 2-megapixel resolution, the full resolution of our training data. Extensive perceptual experiments on datasets of outdoor and indoor scenes demonstrate that images synthesized by the presented approach are considerably more realistic than alternative approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.168","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237430.pdf","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237430/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453257","htmlLink":"/document/8237430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126265S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237431,"authors":[{"name":"Wadim Kehl","affiliation":["Toyota Research Institute, Los Altos","Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Wadim","lastName":"Kehl","id":"37085735735"},{"name":"Fabian Manhardt","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Manhardt","id":"37085664475"},{"name":"Federico Tombari","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Tombari","id":"37593332100"},{"name":"Slobodan Ilic","affiliation":["Siemens R&D, Munich","Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Slobodan","lastName":"Ilic","id":"37266931500"},{"name":"Nassir Navab","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Nassir","lastName":"Navab","id":"37282965500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237431","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":172,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":859},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Training","Two dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Pose estimation","Detectors","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","object detection","pose estimation","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D model instances","synthetic model data","trained networks","detection code","SSD-6D","RGB-based 3D detection","6D pose estimation","SSD paradigm","RGBD data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237431","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237431.pdf","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.169","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSD-6D: Making RGB-Based 3D Detection and 6D Pose Estimation Great Again","abstract":"We present a novel method for detecting 3D model instances and estimating their 6D poses from RGB data in a single shot.

But a persistent challenge remains to develop methods capable of handling large pose variations that are relatively under-represented in training data. This paper presents a method for learning a feature representation that is invariant to pose, without requiring extensive pose coverage in training data. We first propose to generate non-frontal views from a single frontal face, in order to increase the diversity of training data while preserving accurate facial details that are critical for identity discrimination. Our next contribution is to seek a rich embedding that encodes identity features, as well as non-identity ones such as pose and landmark locations. Finally, we propose a new feature reconstruction metric learning to explicitly disentangle identity and pose, by demanding alignment between the feature reconstructions through various combinations of identity and pose features, which is obtained from two images of the same subject. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild face datasets, such as MultiPIE, 300WLP and the profile view database CFP, show that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially on images with large head pose variations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237442.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1641","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction-Based Disentanglement for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Image reconstruction","Face recognition","Training data","Three-dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image reconstruction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature representation","nonfrontal views","identity discrimination","identity features","feature reconstruction metric learning","explicitly disentangle identity","in-the-wild face datasets","pose-invariant face recognition","deep neural networks","pose variations","pose coverage","facial details","Reconstruction-based disentanglement","frontal face","pose features"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction-Based Disentanglement for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237442/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453129","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction-Based Disentanglement for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129407S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237448,"authors":[{"name":"Shizhan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shizhan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085705285"},{"name":"Sanja Fidler","affiliation":["Vector Institute","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Sanja","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37689726500"},{"name":"Raquel Urtasun","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Uber Advanced Technologies Group","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Raquel","lastName":"Urtasun","id":"37269502900"},{"name":"Dahua Lin","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Dahua","lastName":"Lin","id":"37416122100"},{"name":"Chen Change Loy","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chen Change","lastName":"Loy","id":"37411337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237448","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Image segmentation","Shape","Clothing","Coherence","Generators","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prada","fashion synthesis","structural coherence","compositional mapping layer","sentence descriptions","generative model","effective spatial constraint","latent spatial arrangement","plausible semantic segmentation map","conditional stages","complex generative process","input photograph","generative adversarial networks","body structure","language description","input image","generative adversarial learning","clothing"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel and effective approach for generating new clothing on a wearer through generative adversarial learning.

Existing generative adversarial networks are not ideal in ensuring global coherence of structure given both the input photograph and language description as conditions. We address this challenge by decomposing the complex generative process into two conditional stages. In the first stage, we generate a plausible semantic segmentation map that obeys the wearer's pose as a latent spatial arrangement. An effective spatial constraint is formulated to guide the generation of this semantic segmentation map. In the second stage, a generative model with a newly proposed compositional mapping layer is used to render the final image with precise regions and textures conditioned on this map. We extended the DeepFashion dataset [8] by collecting sentence descriptions for 79K images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A user study is also conducted.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Be Your Own Prada: Fashion Synthesis with Structural Coherence","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.186","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237448.pdf","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Be Your Own Prada: Fashion Synthesis with Structural Coherence","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237448/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467792","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Be Your Own Prada: Fashion Synthesis with Structural Coherence","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079639S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237449,"authors":[{"name":"Huaibo Huang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA","Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, CASIA","School of Engineering Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Huaibo","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086295954"},{"name":"Ran He","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA","Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, CASIA","School of Engineering Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"He","id":"37589818700"},{"name":"Zhenan Sun","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA","Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, CASIA","School of Engineering Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Zhenan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086305357"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, CASIA","Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, CASIA","School of Engineering Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237449","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Image resolution","Wavelet domain","Image reconstruction","Wavelet packets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image reconstruction","image representation","image resolution","image texture","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","topology","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HR images reconstruction","high resolution face images","LR images","CNN approach","textural details","convolutional neural networks","multiscale face super resolution","wavelet-SRNet","full-image loss","texture loss","wavelet prediction loss","global topology information","wavelet coefficients","multiple scaling factors","low resolution face image"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.187","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237449.pdf","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.187","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet-SRNet: A Wavelet-Based CNN for Multi-scale Face Super Resolution","abstract":"Most modern face super-resolution methods resort to convolutional neural networks (CNN) to infer highresolution (HR) face images. When dealing with very low resolution (LR) images, the performance of these CNN based methods greatly degrades. Meanwhile, these methods tend to produce over-smoothed outputs and miss some textural details. To address these challenges, this paper presents a wavelet-based CNN approach that can ultra-resolve a very low resolution face image of 16 \u00d7 16 or smaller pixelsize to its larger version of multiple scaling factors (2\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 8\u00d7 and even 16\u00d7) in a unified framework. Different from conventional CNN methods directly inferring HR images, our approach firstly learns to predict the LR's corresponding series of HR's wavelet coefficients before reconstructing HR images from them. To capture both global topology information and local texture details of human faces, we present a flexible and extensible convolutional neural network with three types of loss: wavelet prediction loss, texture loss and full-image loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves more appealing results both quantitatively and qualitatively than state-ofthe- art super-resolution methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452954","htmlLink":"/document/8237449/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet-SRNet: A Wavelet-Based CNN for Multi-scale Face Super Resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet-SRNet: A Wavelet-Based CNN for Multi-scale Face Super Resolution","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08237S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237451,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhang Gu","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Shuhang","lastName":"Gu","id":"37085519992"},{"name":"Deyu Meng","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Deyu","lastName":"Meng","id":"38080754300"},{"name":"Wangmeng Zuo","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Wangmeng","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37299957400"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086288459"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237451","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":532},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Analytical models","Rain","Convolution","Dynamic range","Estimation","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image representation","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["different single image layer separation tasks","JCAS model","high dynamic range image tone mapping","joint convolutional analysis","analysis sparse representation","ASR","SSR","image modeling","complementary representation mechanisms","synthesis sparse representation model","image global information","image fine-scale textures","synthesis dictionary"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237451","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237451.pdf","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.189","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Convolutional Analysis and Synthesis Sparse Representation for Single Image Layer Separation","abstract":"Analysis sparse representation (ASR) and synthesis sparse representation (SSR) are two representative approaches for sparsity-based image modeling.

Often called as the radiometric calibration, the process of recovering RAWimages from processed images (JPEG format in the sRGB color space) is essential for many computer vision tasks that rely on physically accurate radiance values. All previous works rely on the deterministic imaging model where the color transformation stays the same regardless of the scene and thus they can only be applied for images taken under the manual mode. In this paper, we propose a datadriven approach to learn the scene dependent and locally varying image processing inside cameras under the automode. Our method incorporates both the global and the local scene context into pixel-wise features via multi-scale pyramid of learnable histogram layers. The results show that we can model the imaging pipeline of different cameras that operate under the automode accurately in both directions (from RAW to sRGB, from sRGB to RAW) and we show how we can apply our method to improve the performance of image deblurring.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.190","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1734","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237452.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling the Scene Dependent Imaging in Cameras with a Deep Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Cameras","Histograms","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","computer vision","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural network","deep learning framework","scene dependent image processing","radiometric calibration","JPEG format","sRGB color space","computer vision tasks","deterministic imaging model","color transformation","local scene context","imaging pipeline","image deblurring","cameras","raw image recovery","data-driven approach","locally varying image processing","automode","pixel-wise features","multiscale pyramid","learnable histogram layers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modelling the Scene Dependent Imaging in Cameras with a Deep Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237452/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467830","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling the Scene Dependent Imaging in Cameras with a Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078663S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237453,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Chang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Multispectral Information Processing, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085468246"},{"name":"Luxin Yan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Multispectral Information Processing, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Luxin","lastName":"Yan","id":"37407346600"},{"name":"Sheng Zhong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Multispectral Information Processing, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37858761700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237453","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":438},"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of line pattern noise removal from a single image, such as rain streak, hyperspectral stripe and so on. Most of the previous methods model the line pattern noise in original image domain, which fail to explicitly exploit the directional characteristic, thus resulting in a redundant subspace with poor representation ability for those line pattern noise. To achieve a compact subspace for the line pattern structure, in this work, we incorporate a transformation into the image decomposition model so that maps the input image to a domain where the line pattern appearance has an extremely distinct low-rank structure, which naturally allows us to enforce a low-rank prior to extract the line pattern streak/stripe from the noisy image. Moreover, the random noise is usually mixed up with the line pattern noise, which makes the challenging problem much more difficult. While previous methods resort to the spectral or temporal correlation of the multi-images, we give a detailed analysis between the noisy and clean image in both local gradient and nonlocal domain, and propose a compositional directional total variational and low-rank prior for the image layer, thus to simultaneously accommodate both types of noise. The proposed method has been evaluated on two different tasks, including remote sensing image mixed random-stripe noise removal and rain streak removal, all of which obtain very impressive performances.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237453.pdf","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1743","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transformed Low-Rank Model for Line Pattern Noise Removal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Degradation","Dictionaries","Noise measurement","Image decomposition","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image denoising","image resolution","random noise","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extremely distinct low-rank structure","line pattern streak/stripe","noisy image","random noise","remote sensing image mixed random-stripe noise removal","line pattern noise removal","single image","line pattern structure","image decomposition model","line pattern appearance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Transformed Low-Rank Model for Line Pattern Noise Removal","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237453/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467840","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformed Low-Rank Model for Line Pattern Noise Removal","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067299S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237455,"authors":[{"name":"Junfeng Yang","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart City, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Junfeng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086284051"},{"name":"Xueyang Fu","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart City, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Xueyang","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085404510"},{"name":"Yuwen Hu","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart City, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Yuwen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086281152"},{"name":"Yue Huang","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart City, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085355367"},{"name":"Xinghao Ding","affiliation":["Fujian Key Laboratory of Sensing and Computing for Smart City, Xiamen University, China"],"firstName":"Xinghao","lastName":"Ding","id":"37979781200"},{"name":"John Paisley","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Paisley","id":"37688543100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237455","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Satellites","Neural networks","Spatial resolution","Machine learning","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-pass filters","image filtering","image reconstruction","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain-specific knowledge","deep network architecture","high-pass filtering domain","network parameters","reconstructed image","spectral information","multispectral images","spatial preservation","spectral preservation","PanNet architecture","pan-sharpening problem"]}],"abstract":"We propose a deep network architecture for the pan-sharpening problem called PanNet.

Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video. However, existing methods focus on directly hallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we develop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the pixel-wise flows in the video through a dual-learning mechanism. The primal future-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop, generating informative feedback signals to each other for better video prediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable from reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the future-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the future-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual motion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations with a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational autoencoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual motion GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthesizing new video frames and predicting future flows.

Recently, Siamese networks have shown great potentials of matching based trackers in achieving balanced accuracy and beyond realtime speed. However, they still have a big gap to classification & updating based trackers in tolerating the temporal changes of objects and imaging conditions. In this paper, we propose dynamic Siamese network, via a fast transformation learning model that enables effective online learning of target appearance variation and background suppression from previous frames. We then present elementwise multi-layer fusion to adaptively integrate the network outputs using multi-level deep features. Unlike state-of-theart trackers, our approach allows the usage of any feasible generally- or particularly-trained features, such as SiamFC and VGG. More importantly, the proposed dynamic Siamese network can be jointly trained as a whole directly on the labeled video sequences, thus can take full advantage of the rich spatial temporal information of moving objects. As a result, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on OTB-2013 and VOT-2015 benchmarks, while exhibits superiorly balanced accuracy and real-time response over state-of-the-art competitors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.196","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237458.pdf","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Dynamic Siamese Network for Visual Object Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Dynamic Siamese Network for Visual Object Tracking","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237458/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453300","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237458/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Dynamic Siamese Network for Visual Object Tracking","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104926S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237460,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Meinhardt","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Meinhardt","id":"37085535952"},{"name":"Michael Moeller","affiliation":["University of Siegen"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Moeller","id":"37391256600"},{"name":"Caner Hazirbas","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Caner","lastName":"Hazirbas","id":"37085669019"},{"name":"Daniel Cremers","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cremers","id":"37282875300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237460","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237460","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Mathematical model","Neural networks","Hafnium","Gold","Training","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deconvolution","image denoising","image restoration","image segmentation","inverse problems","learning (artificial intelligence)","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse imaging problems","linear inverse problems","deep neural networks","convolutional","convex energy minimization algorithms","fixed denoising neural network","image deconvolution","image demosaicking","deep learning","data fidelity","blur kernels"]}],"abstract":"While variational methods have been among the most powerful tools for solving linear inverse problems in imaging, deep (convolutional) neural networks have recently taken the lead in many challenging benchmarks. A remaining drawback of deep learning approaches is their requirement for an expensive retraining whenever the specific problem, the noise level, noise type, or desired measure of fidelity changes. On the contrary, variational methods have a plug-and-play nature as they usually consist of separate data fidelity and regularization terms. In this paper we study the possibility of replacing the proximal operator of the regularization used in many convex energy minimization algorithms by a denoising neural network. The latter therefore serves as an implicit natural image prior, while the data term can still be chosen independently. Using a fixed denoising neural network in exemplary problems of image deconvolution with different blur kernels and image demosaicking, we obtain state-of-the-art reconstruction results. These indicate the high generalizability of our approach and a reduction of the need for problem-specific training. Additionally, we discuss novel results on the analysis of possible optimization algorithms to incorporate the network into, as well as the choices of algorithm parameters and their relation to the noise level the neural network is trained on.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.198","startPage":"1799","endPage":"1808","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237460.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Proximal Operators: Using Denoising Networks for Regularizing Inverse Imaging Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237460/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Proximal Operators: Using Denoising Networks for Regularizing Inverse Imaging Problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453057","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237460/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Proximal Operators: Using Denoising Networks for Regularizing Inverse Imaging Problems","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169044S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237462,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085385864"},{"name":"Xiaodan Liang","affiliation":["Carneige Mellon University"],"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086245334"},{"name":"Xiaolong Wang","affiliation":["Carneige Mellon University"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085652454"},{"name":"Dit-Yan Yeung","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Dit-Yan","lastName":"Yeung","id":"37270592100"},{"name":"Abhinav Gupta","affiliation":["Carneige Mellon University"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37291130800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237462","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Proposals","Visualization","Topology","Detectors","Correlation","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object recognition","temporal reasoning","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["existing domain shift","daily activities","bounding boxes","action descriptions","supervision","common issue","human actions","TD-Graph LSTM","global temporal reasoning","temporal correlations","missing label issue","correlated objects proposals","daily-life action dataset","object recognition","weakly-supervised object detection framework","existing frameworks","static images","temporal dynamic graph LSTM","object detector learning","action-driven video object detection","boring videos","global action description","novel temporal dynamic graph long short-term memory network","large-scale daily-life action dataset","object bounding-box annotations","Charades"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate a weakly-supervised object detection framework. Most existing frameworks focus on using static images to learn object detectors. However, these detectors often fail to generalize to videos because of the existing domain shift. Therefore, we investigate learning these detectors directly from boring videos of daily activities. Instead of using bounding boxes, we explore the use of action descriptions as supervision since they are relatively easy to gather. A common issue, however, is that objects of interest that are not involved in human actions are often absent in global action descriptions known as \u201cmissing label\u201d. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel temporal dynamic graph Long Short-Term Memory network (TDGraph LSTM). TD-Graph LSTM enables global temporal reasoning by constructing a dynamic graph that is based on temporal correlations of object proposals and spans the entire video. The missing label issue for each individual frame can thus be significantly alleviated by transferring knowledge across correlated objects proposals in the whole video. Extensive evaluations on a large-scale daily-life action dataset (i.e., Charades) demonstrates the superiority of our proposed method. We also release object bounding-box annotations for more than 5,000 frames in Charades. We believe this annotated data can also benefit other research on video-based object recognition in the future.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237462.pdf","startPage":"1819","endPage":"1828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Dynamic Graph LSTM for Action-Driven Video Object Detection","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Dynamic Graph LSTM for Action-Driven Video Object Detection","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453151","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237462/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Dynamic Graph LSTM for Action-Driven Video Object Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091956S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237464,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Yu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation, Hangzhou Dianzi University, P.

The approaches used to represent the images and questions in a fine-grained manner and questions and to fuse these multimodal features play key roles in performance. Bilinear pooling based models have been shown to outperform traditional linear models for VQA, but their high-dimensional representations and high computational complexity may seriously limit their applicability in practice. For multimodal feature fusion, here we develop a Multi-modal Factorized Bilinear (MFB) pooling approach to efficiently and effectively combine multi-modal features, which results in superior performance for VQA compared with other bilinear pooling approaches. For fine-grained image and question representation, we develop a `co-attention' mechanism using an end-to-end deep network architecture to jointly learn both the image and question attentions. Combining the proposed MFB approach with co-attention learning in a new network architecture provides a unified model for VQA. Our experimental results demonstrate that the single MFB with co-attention model achieves new state-of-theart performance on the real-world VQA dataset.

Compared with chain structured RNN, our proposed model exploits the hierarchical relations between sentences and phrases, and between whole images and image regions, to jointly establish their representations. Without the need of any supervised labels, our proposed model automatically learns the fine-grained correspondences between phrases and image regions towards the dense embedding. Extensive experiments on several datasets validate the efficacy of our method, which compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453073","htmlLink":"/document/8237470/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Multimodal LSTM for Dense Visual-Semantic Embedding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Multimodal LSTM for Dense Visual-Semantic Embedding","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074379S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237472,"authors":[{"name":"Yantao Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yantao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086327038"},{"name":"Tong Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085509361"},{"name":"Hongsheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hongsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37067578200"},{"name":"Shuai Yi","affiliation":["SenseTime Group Limited"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Yi","id":"37085465314"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237472","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Proposals","Visualization","Automobiles","Biological neural networks","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image retrieval","intelligent transportation systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","road vehicles","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deeply learned potential function","Siamese-CNN+Path- LSTM model","candidate path","Vehicle Re-ID","video surveillance","intelligent transportation","visual differences","vehicle images","spatiotemporal information","spatiotemporal relations","deep neural networks learning","visual-spatio-temporal path proposals","person reidentification techniques","vehicle reidentification methods","pairwise queries","similarity score"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.210","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237472.pdf","startPage":"1918","endPage":"1927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Deep Neural Networks for Vehicle Re-ID with Visual-spatio-Temporal Path Proposals","abstract":"Vehicle re-identification is an important problem and has many applications in video surveillance and intelligent transportation. It gains increasing attention because of the recent advances of person re-identification techniques. However, unlike person re-identification, the visual differences between pairs of vehicle images are usually subtle and even challenging for humans to distinguish. Incorporating additional spatio-temporal information is vital for solving the challenging re-identification task. Existing vehicle re-identification methods ignored or used oversimplified models for the spatio-temporal relations between vehicle images. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework that incorporates complex spatio-temporal information for effectively regularizing the re-identification results. Given a pair of vehicle images with their spatiotemporal information, a candidate visual-spatio-temporal path is first generated by a chain MRF model with a deeply learned potential function, where each visual-spatiotemporal state corresponds to an actual vehicle image with its spatio-temporal information. A Siamese-CNN+Path- LSTM model takes the candidate path as well as the pairwise queries to generate their similarity score. Extensive experiments and analysis show the effectiveness of our proposed method and individual components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453173","htmlLink":"/document/8237472/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning Deep Neural Networks for Vehicle Re-ID with Visual-spatio-Temporal Path Proposals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Deep Neural Networks for Vehicle Re-ID with Visual-spatio-Temporal Path Proposals","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103321S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8237473,"authors":[{"name":"Yuncheng Li","affiliation":["Snap Inc."],"firstName":"Yuncheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086219333"},{"name":"Jianchao Yang","affiliation":["Snap Inc."],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086229607"},{"name":"Yale Song","affiliation":["Yahoo Research"],"firstName":"Yale","lastName":"Song","id":"37085682508"},{"name":"Liangliang Cao","affiliation":["hellovera.ai"],"firstName":"Liangliang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085450668"},{"name":"Jiebo Luo","affiliation":["University of Rochester"],"firstName":"Jiebo","lastName":"Luo","id":"37278982400"},{"name":"Li-Jia Li","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Li-Jia","lastName":"Li","id":"37086308200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237473","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Visualization","Predictive models","Internet","Algorithm design and analysis","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["label noise","real-world noisy labels","label relations","simulated label noises","noisy labels learning","visual recognition","statistical outliers","bootstrapping","multimode characteristics","independent random outliers","unified distillation framework","side information","knowledge graph"]}],"abstract":"The ability of learning from noisy labels is very useful in many visual recognition tasks, as a vast amount of data with noisy labels are relatively easy to obtain. Traditionally, label noise has been treated as statistical outliers, and techniques such as importance re-weighting and bootstrapping have been proposed to alleviate the problem. According to our observation, the real-world noisy labels exhibit multimode characteristics as the true labels, rather than behaving like independent random outliers. In this work, we propose a unified distillation framework to use \u201cside\u201d information, including a small clean dataset and label relations in knowledge graph, to \u201chedge the risk\u201d of learning from noisy labels. Unlike the traditional approaches evaluated based on simulated label noises, we propose a suite of new benchmark datasets, in Sports, Species and Artifacts domains, to evaluate the task of learning from noisy labels in the practical setting.

State-of-the-art object objectors rely heavily on the off the-shelf networks pre-trained on large-scale classification datasets like Image Net, which incurs learning bias due to the difference on both the loss functions and the category distributions between classification and detection tasks. Model fine-tuning for the detection task could alleviate this bias to some extent but not fundamentally. Besides, transferring pre-trained models from classification to detection between discrepant domains is even more difficult (e.g. RGB to depth images). A better solution to tackle these two critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch, which motivates our proposed DSOD. Previous efforts in this direction mostly failed due to much more complicated loss functions and limited training data in object detection. In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for training object detectors from scratch. One of the key findings is that deep supervision, enabled by dense layer-wise connections, plays a critical role in learning a good detector. Combining with several other principles, we develop DSOD following the single-shot detection (SSD) framework. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that DSOD can achieve better results than the state-of-the-art solutions with much more compact models. For instance, DSOD outperforms SSD on all three benchmarks with real-time detection speed, while requires only 1/2 parameters to SSD and 1/10 parameters to Faster RCNN.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.212","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237474.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSOD: Learning Deeply Supervised Object Detectors from Scratch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DSOD: Learning Deeply Supervised Object Detectors from Scratch","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237474/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467888","htmlLink":"/document/8237474/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSOD: Learning Deeply Supervised Object Detectors from Scratch","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148586S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237477,"authors":[{"name":"Seokju Lee","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"Seokju","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086144941"},{"name":"Junsik Kim","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"Junsik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085431302"},{"name":"Jae Shin Yoon","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"Jae Shin","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085646686"},{"name":"Seunghak Shin","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"Seunghak","lastName":"Shin","id":"38252213800"},{"name":"Oleksandr Bailo","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Bailo","id":"37086147997"},{"name":"Namil Kim","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"Namil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085628320"},{"name":"Tae-Hee Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics DMC R&D Center"],"firstName":"Tae-Hee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37088746554"},{"name":"Hyun Seok Hong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics DMC R&D Center"],"firstName":"Hyun Seok","lastName":"Hong","id":"37088744277"},{"name":"Seung-Hoon Han","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics DMC R&D Center"],"firstName":"Seung-Hoon","lastName":"Han","id":"37086265760"},{"name":"In So Kweon","affiliation":["Robotics and Computer Vision Lab., KAIST"],"firstName":"In So","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37270474800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237477","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":748},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a unified end-to-end trainable multi-task network that jointly handles lane and road marking detection and recognition that is guided by a vanishing point under adverse weather conditions. We tackle rainy and low illumination conditions, which have not been extensively studied until now due to clear challenges. For example, images taken under rainy days are subject to low illumination, while wet roads cause light reflection and distort the appearance of lane and road markings. At night, color distortion occurs under limited illumination. As a result, no benchmark dataset exists and only a few developed algorithms work under poor weather conditions. To address this shortcoming, we build up a lane and road marking benchmark which consists of about 20,000 images with 17 lane and road marking classes under four different scenarios: no rain, rain, heavy rain, and night. We train and evaluate several versions of the proposed multi-task network and validate the importance of each task. The resulting approach, VPGNet, can detect and classify lanes and road markings, and predict a vanishing point with a single forward pass. Experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy and robustness under various conditions in realtime (20 fps). The benchmark and the VPGNet model will be publicly available.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237477.pdf","startPage":"1965","endPage":"1973","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VPGNet: Vanishing Point Guided Network for Lane and Road Marking Detection and Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Feature extraction","Benchmark testing","Rain","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image colour analysis","image recognition","object detection","rain","road vehicles","roads","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified end-to-end trainable multitask network","jointly handles lane","road marking detection","rainy days","wet roads","road markings","color distortion","benchmark dataset","poor weather conditions","road marking benchmark","road marking classes","VPGNet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"VPGNet: Vanishing Point Guided Network for Lane and Road Marking Detection and Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237477/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467812","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VPGNet: Vanishing Point Guided Network for Lane and Road Marking Detection and Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032b965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0741S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237480,"authors":[{"name":"Dahjung Chung","affiliation":["Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER), Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA"],"firstName":"Dahjung","lastName":"Chung","id":"37086289401"},{"name":"Khalid Tahboub","affiliation":["Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER), Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Tahboub","id":"37085403200"},{"name":"Edward J.

The method gives the best known seeded segmentation results on the CREMI segmentation challenge.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.222","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2038","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237484.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learned Watershed: End-to-End Learning of Seeded Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learned Watershed: End-to-End Learning of Seeded Segmentation","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237484/","accessionNumber":"17434832","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237484/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learned Watershed: End-to-End Learning of Seeded Segmentation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113851S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237485,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086315218"},{"name":"Philip David","affiliation":["Computational and Information Sciences Directorate, U.S. Army Research Laboratory"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"David","id":"37556177300"},{"name":"Boqing Gong","affiliation":["Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Boqing","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086085238"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237485","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Semantics","Training","Adaptation models","Computer vision","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","convolution","image classification","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curriculum domain adaptation","semantic segmentation","urban scenes","convolutional neural networks","CNNs","computer graphics","CNN models","urban traffic scenes","segmentation network","computer-generated annotations","curriculum-style learning"]}],"abstract":"During the last half decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have triumphed over semantic segmentation, which is a core task of various emerging industrial applications such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. However, to train CNNs requires a huge amount of data, which is difficult to collect and laborious to annotate. Recent advances in computer graphics make it possible to train CNN models on photo-realistic synthetic data with computer-generated annotations. Despite this, the domain mismatch between the real images and the synthetic data significantly decreases the models' performance. Hence we propose a curriculum-style learning approach to minimize the domain gap in semantic segmentation. The curriculum domain adaptation solves easy tasks first in order to infer some necessary properties about the target domain; in particular, the first task is to learn global label distributions over images and local distributions over landmark superpixels. These are easy to estimate because images of urban traffic scenes have strong idiosyncrasies (e.g., the size and spatial relations of buildings, streets, cars, etc.). We then train the segmentation network in such a way that the network predictions in the target domain follow those inferred properties. In experiments, our method significantly outperforms the baselines as well as the only known existing approach to the same problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.223","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237485.pdf","startPage":"2039","endPage":"2049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Curriculum Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Curriculum Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237485/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453081","htmlLink":"/document/8237485/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Curriculum Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114571S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237488,"authors":[{"name":"Carl Doersch","affiliation":["DeepMind"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Doersch","id":"38277532000"},{"name":"Andrew Zisserman","affiliation":["DeepMind","VGG, University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Zisserman","id":"37266140000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237488","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"abstract":"We investigate methods for combining multiple self-supervised tasks-i.e., supervised tasks where data can be collected without manual labeling-in order to train a single visual representation.

Since the end goal of large-scale recognition is to delineate complex boundaries of thousands of classes, adequate exploration of feature distributions is important for realizing full potentials of ConvNets. However, state-of-the-art works concentrate only on deeper or wider architecture design, while rarely exploring feature statistics higher than first-order. We take a step towards addressing this problem. Our method consists in covariance pooling, instead of the most commonly used first-order pooling, of highlevel convolutional features. The main challenges involved are robust covariance estimation given a small sample of large-dimensional features and usage of the manifold structure of covariance matrices. To address these challenges, we present a Matrix Power Normalized Covariance (MPNCOV) method. We develop forward and backward propagation formulas regarding the nonlinear matrix functions such that MPN-COV can be trained end-to-end. In addition, we analyze both qualitatively and quantitatively its advantage over the well-known Log-Euclidean metric. On the ImageNet 2012 validation set, by combining MPN-COV we achieve over 4%, 3% and 2.5% gains for AlexNet, VGG-M and VGG-16, respectively; integration of MPN-COV into 50-layer ResNet outperforms ResNet-101 and is comparable to ResNet-152.

Extensive experiment analyses show that the proposed view adaptive RNN model strives to (1) transform the skeletons of various views to much more consistent viewpoints and (2) maintain the continuity of the action rather than transforming every frame to the same position with the same body orientation.

What directions forward are most promising? In this work, we analyze the current state of human activity understanding in videos. The goal of this paper is to examine datasets, evaluation metrics, algorithms, and potential future directions. We look at the qualitative attributes that define activities such as pose variability, brevity, and density. The experiments consider multiple state-of-the-art algorithms and multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that while there is inherent ambiguity in the temporal extent of activities, current datasets still permit effective benchmarking. We discover that fine-grained understanding of objects and pose when combined with temporal reasoning is likely to yield substantial improvements in algorithmic accuracy. We present the many kinds of information that will be needed to achieve substantial gains in activity understanding: objects, verbs, intent, and sequential reasoning. The software and additional information will be made available to provide other researchers detailed diagnostics to understand their own algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.235","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237497.pdf","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Actions are Needed for Understanding Human Actions in Videos?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237497/","displayDocTitle":"What Actions are Needed for Understanding Human Actions in Videos?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452976","htmlLink":"/document/8237497/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Actions are Needed for Understanding Human Actions in Videos?","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0796S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237498,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Sun","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","Stanford University"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37893973100"},{"name":"Kui Jia","affiliation":["South China University of Technology"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Jia","id":"37683115500"},{"name":"Kevin Chen","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086275542"},{"name":"Dit Yan Yeung","affiliation":["The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Dit Yan","lastName":"Yeung","id":"37270592100"},{"name":"Bertram E.

To learn action patterns, existing methods adopt Convolutional and/or Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs). CNN based methods are effective in learning spatial appearances, but are limited in modeling long-term motion dynamics. RNNs, especially Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM), are able to learn temporal motion dynamics. However, naively applying RNNs to video sequences in a convolutional manner implicitly assumes that motions in videos are stationary across different spatial locations. This assumption is valid for short-term motions but invalid when the duration of the motion is long.,,In this work, we propose Lattice-LSTM (L2STM), which extends LSTM by learning independent hidden state transitions of memory cells for individual spatial locations. This method effectively enhances the ability to model dynamics across time and addresses the non-stationary issue of long-term motion dynamics without significantly increasing the model complexity. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-modal training procedure for training our network. Unlike traditional two-stream architectures which use RGB and optical flow information as input, our two-stream model leverages both modalities to jointly train both input gates and both forget gates in the network rather than treating the two streams as separate entities with no information about the other. We apply this end-to-end system to benchmark datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) of human action recognition. Experiments show that on both datasets, our proposed method outperforms all existing ones that are based on LSTM and/or CNNs of similar model complexities.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.236","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237498.pdf","startPage":"2166","endPage":"2175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Long Short-Term Memory for Human Action Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237498/","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Long Short-Term Memory for Human Action Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453120","htmlLink":"/document/8237498/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Long Short-Term Memory for Human Action Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114147S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237500,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Shin Yoon","affiliation":["UMN, Minneapolis, MN","KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Shin","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085646686"},{"name":"Francois Rameau","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Rameau","id":"37892103100"},{"name":"Junsik Kim","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junsik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085431302"},{"name":"Seokju Lee","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seokju","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085378123"},{"name":"Seunghak Shin","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seunghak","lastName":"Shin","id":"38252213800"},{"name":"In So Kweon","affiliation":["KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"In So","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37270474800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237500","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Feature extraction","Object segmentation","Training","Semantics","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","data compression","feature extraction","image matching","image segmentation","image sequences","neural nets","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["category-level semantic information","feature compression technique","feature representation","target object","video sequence","pixel-level matching","Convolutional Neural Networks","video object segmentation algorithm","pixel-level similarity","depth layers"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel video object segmentation algorithm based on pixel-level matching using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Then, aesthetics assessment is employed to select the final crop as the one with the best aesthetic quality. With our network, cropping candidates share features within full-image convolutional feature maps, thus avoiding repeated feature computation and leading to higher computation efficiency.

Our goal is to learn a mapping G : X \u2192 Y such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F : Y \u2192 X and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X)) \u2248 X (and vice versa).

But due to GPU memory limitations, these methods can only produce low-resolution outputs. To inpaint 3D models with semantic plausibility and contextual details, we introduce a hybrid framework that combines a 3D Encoder-Decoder Generative Adversarial Network (3D-ED-GAN) and a Longterm Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN). The 3DED- GAN is a 3D convolutional neural network trained with a generative adversarial paradigm to fill missing 3D data in low-resolution. LRCN adopts a recurrent neural network architecture to minimize GPU memory usage and incorporates an Encoder-Decoder pair into a Long Short-term Memory Network. By handling the 3D model as a sequence of 2D slices, LRCN transforms a coarse 3D shape into a more complete and higher resolution volume. While 3D-ED-GAN captures global contextual structure of the 3D shape, LRCN localizes the fine-grained details. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic data show reconstructions from corrupted models result in complete and high-resolution 3D objects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453168","htmlLink":"/document/8237514/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Shape Inpainting Using 3D Generative Adversarial Network and Recurrent Convolutional Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape Inpainting Using 3D Generative Adversarial Network and Recurrent Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085412S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237515,"authors":[{"name":"Mengqi Ji","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Mengqi","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085703370"},{"name":"Juergen Gall","affiliation":["University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Gall","id":"37393846400"},{"name":"Haitian Zheng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haitian","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085705216"},{"name":"Yebin Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yebin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292048700"},{"name":"Lu Fang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37532747600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237515","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Cameras","Image reconstruction","Surface treatment","Training","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end-to-end 3D neural network","multiview stereopsis","SurfaceNet","camera parameters","3D voxel representation","fully 3D convolutional network","end-to-end learning framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237515","abstract":"This paper proposes an end-to-end learning framework for multiview stereopsis.

We evaluate SurfaceNet on the large-scale DTU benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.253","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237515.pdf","startPage":"2326","endPage":"2334","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SurfaceNet: An End-to-End 3D Neural Network for Multiview Stereopsis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"SurfaceNet: An End-to-End 3D Neural Network for Multiview Stereopsis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453204","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237515/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SurfaceNet: An End-to-End 3D Neural Network for Multiview Stereopsis","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067952S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237518,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Shu Fang","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Hao-Shu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37086276017"},{"name":"Shuqin Xie","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Shuqin","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086275901"},{"name":"Yu-Wing Tai","affiliation":["Tencent YouTu"],"firstName":"Yu-Wing","lastName":"Tai","id":"37086282403"},{"name":"Cewu Lu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Cewu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085682104"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237518","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":203,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1061},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237518","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pose estimation","Proposals","Detectors","Training","Generators","Pipelines","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","object detection","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regional multiperson pose estimation","human detection","human detectors","single-person pose estimator","Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network","Pose-Guided Proposals Generator","MPII dataset","Parametric Pose NonMaximum-Suppression"]}],"abstract":"Multi-person pose estimation in the wild is challenging. Although state-of-the-art human detectors have demonstrated good performance, small errors in localization and recognition are inevitable. These errors can cause failures for a single-person pose estimator (SPPE), especially for methods that solely depend on human detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel regional multi-person pose estimation (RMPE) framework to facilitate pose estimation in the presence of inaccurate human bounding boxes. Our framework consists of three components: Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN), Parametric Pose Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), and Pose-Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG). Our method is able to handle inaccurate bounding boxes and redundant detections, allowing it to achieve 76:7 mAP on the MPII (multi person) dataset[3].

Since direct application of image-based object detection cannot leverage the rich temporal information inherent in video data, we advocate to the detection of long-range video object pattern. While the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been the de facto choice for such detection, currently LSTM cannot fundamentally model object association between consecutive frames. In this paper, we propose the association LSTM to address this fundamental association problem. Association LSTM not only regresses and classifiy directly on object locations and categories but also associates features to represent each output object. By minimizing the matching error between these features, we learn how to associate objects in two consecutive frames. Additionally, our method works in an online manner, which is important for most video tasks. Compared to the traditional video object detection methods, our approach outperforms them on standard video datasets.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237519.pdf","startPage":"2363","endPage":"2371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Video Object Detection Using Association LSTM","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.257","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Online Video Object Detection Using Association LSTM","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453235","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237519/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Video Object Detection Using Association LSTM","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078491S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237524,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Shen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University","Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Shen","id":"37071253800"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089060978"},{"name":"Yuan Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086057714"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086050244"},{"name":"Alan Yuille","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Yuille","id":"37282960000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237524","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Training","Two dimensional displays","Biomembranes","Neurons","Machine learning","Network architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain models","cellular biophysics","convolution","image reconstruction","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intracellular structure","cortical connectivity identification","different possible segmentation solutions","multiscale contextual boundary information","multiple recursive inputs","multistage multirecursiveinput fully convolutional networks","EM images","multistage multirecursive-input","neuronal boundary detection","Electron Microscopy images","automatic reconstruction","neuronal circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237524","abstract":"In the field of connectomics, neuroscientists seek to identify cortical connectivity comprehensively. Neuronal boundary detection from the Electron Microscopy (EM) images is often done to assist the automatic reconstruction of neuronal circuit. But the segmentation of EM images is a challenging problem, as it requires the detector to be able to detect both filament-like thin and blob-like thick membrane, while suppressing the ambiguous intracellular structure. In this paper, we propose multi-stage multi-recursiveinput fully convolutional networks to address this problem. The multiple recursive inputs for one stage, i.e., the multiple side outputs with different receptive field sizes learned from the lower stage, provide multi-scale contextual boundary information for the consecutive learning. This design is biologically-plausible, as it likes a human visual system to compare different possible segmentation solutions to address the ambiguous boundary issue. Our multi-stage networks are trained end-to-end. It achieves promising results on two public available EM segmentation datasets, the mouse piriform cortex dataset and the ISBI 2012 EM dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.262","startPage":"2410","endPage":"2419","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237524.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-stage Multi-recursive-input Fully Convolutional Networks for Neuronal Boundary Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237524/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-stage Multi-recursive-input Fully Convolutional Networks for Neuronal Boundary Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237524/","accessionNumber":"17453027","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-stage Multi-recursive-input Fully Convolutional Networks for Neuronal Boundary Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151082S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237527,"authors":[{"name":"Jiahuan Zhou","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, US"],"firstName":"Jiahuan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086011766"},{"name":"Pei Yu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, US"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086078671"},{"name":"Wei Tang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, US"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086264235"},{"name":"Ying Wu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, US"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281224100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237527","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"abstract":"Many existing person re-identification (PRID) methods typically attempt to train a faithful global metric offline to cover the enormous visual appearance variations, so as to directly use it online on various probes for identity matching. However, their need for a huge set of positive training pairs is very demanding in practice. In contrast to these methods, this paper advocates a different paradigm: part of the learning can be performed online but with nominal costs, so as to achieve online metric adaptation for different input probes. A major challenge here is that no positive training pairs are available for the probe anymore. By only exploiting easily-available negative samples, we propose a novel solution to achieve local metric adaptation effectively and efficiently. For each probe at the test time, it learns a strictly positive semi-definite dedicated local metric. Comparing to offline global metric learning, its computational cost is negligible. The insight of this new method is that the local hard negative samples can actually provide tight constraints to fine tune the metric locally. This new local metric adaptation method is generally applicable, as it can be used on top of any global metric to enhance its performance. In addition, this paper gives in-depth theoretical analysis and justification of the new method. We prove that our new method guarantees the reduction of the classification error asymptotically, and prove that it actually learns the optimal local metric to best approximate the asymptotic case by a finite number of training data. Extensive experiments and comparative studies on almost all major benchmarks (VIPeR, QMUL GRID, CUHK Campus, CUHK03 and Market-1501) have confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of our method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Probes","Training","Visualization","Training data","Support vector machines","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global metric learning","local hard negative samples","local metric adaptation method","efficient online local metric adaptation","existing person re-identification methods","faithful global metric offline","enormous visual appearance variations","identity matching","online metric adaptation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.265","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237527.pdf","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Online Local Metric Adaptation via Negative Samples for Person Re-identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Online Local Metric Adaptation via Negative Samples for Person Re-identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237527/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237527/","accessionNumber":"17453301","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Online Local Metric Adaptation via Negative Samples for Person Re-identification","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091559S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237528,"authors":[{"name":"Zimo Liu","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Zimo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086310187"},{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37598468300"},{"name":"Huchuan Lu","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Huchuan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37401005700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237528","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Probes","Estimation","Training","Measurement","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised video person re-identification","cross-camera nearest neighbors","hard negative label matches","reciprocal nearest neighbor search","cross-camera training","cross-camera tracklet association","stepwise metric promotion approach","intensive annotation cost"]}],"abstract":"The intensive annotation cost and the rich but unlabeled data contained in videos motivate us to propose an unsupervised video-based person re-identification (re-ID) method.

Based on these assumptions, this paper propose a stepwise metric promotion approach to estimate the identities of training tracklets, which iterates between cross-camera tracklet association and feature learning. Specifically, We use each training tracklet as a query, and perform retrieval in the cross-camera training set. Our method is built on reciprocal nearest neighbor search and can eliminate the hard negative label matches, i.e., the cross-camera nearest neighbors of the false matches in the initial rank list. The tracklet that passes the reciprocal nearest neighbor check is considered to have the same ID with the query.

Although data-driven deep learning methods have been proposed to address this problem by seeking solutions from ample face data, this problem is still challenging because it is intrinsically ill-posed. This paper proposes a Two-Pathway Generative Adversarial Network (TP-GAN) for photorealistic frontal view synthesis by simultaneously perceiving global structures and local details. Four landmark located patch networks are proposed to attend to local textures in addition to the commonly used global encoder-decoder network. Except for the novel architecture, we make this ill-posed problem well constrained by introducing a combination of adversarial loss, symmetry loss and identity preserving loss. The combined loss function leverages both frontal face distribution and pre-trained discriminative deep face models to guide an identity preserving inference of frontal views from profiles. Different from previous deep learning methods that mainly rely on intermediate features for recognition, our method directly leverages the synthesized identity preserving image for downstream tasks like face recognition and attribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only presents compelling perceptual results but also outperforms state-of-the-art results on large pose face recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467986","htmlLink":"/document/8237529/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Beyond Face Rotation: Global and Local Perception GAN for Photorealistic and Identity Preserving Frontal View Synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Face Rotation: Global and Local Perception GAN for Photorealistic and Identity Preserving Frontal View Synthesis","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075823S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237533,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangxin Dong","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Jiangxin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086297684"},{"name":"Jinshan Pan","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jinshan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37070435400"},{"name":"Zhixun Su","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology","Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Zhixun","lastName":"Su","id":"37529847500"},{"name":"Ming-Hsuan Yang","affiliation":["UC Merced"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37277304600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237533","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Estimation","Image restoration","Robustness","Image edge detection","Optimization","Anomaly detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outlier handling","deblurring images","blur kernel estimation","blind deblurring methods","intermediate latent images","generic image deblurring","nonuniform deblurring","real-world images","blind image deblurring algorithm","function approximation","data fidelity"]}],"abstract":"Deblurring images with outliers has attracted considerable attention recently. However, existing algorithms usually involve complex operations which increase the difficulty of blur kernel estimation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective blind image deblurring algorithm to handle blurred images with outliers. The proposed method is motivated by the observation that outliers in the blurred images significantly affect the goodness-of-fit in function approximation. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to model the data fidelity term so that the outliers have little effect on kernel estimation. The proposed algorithm does not require any heuristic outlier detection step, which is critical to the state-of-the-art blind deblurring methods for images with outliers. We analyze the relationship between the proposed algorithm and other blind deblurring methods with outlier handling and show how to estimate intermediate latent images for blur kernel estimation principally. We show that the proposed method can be applied to generic image deblurring as well as non-uniform deblurring. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art blind image deblurring methods on both synthetic and real-world images.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.271","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237533.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.271","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","startPage":"2497","endPage":"2505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Image Deblurring with Outlier Handling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Blind Image Deblurring with Outlier Handling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237533/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237533/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467886","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Image Deblurring with Outlier Handling","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066051S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8237535,"authors":[{"name":"Qifeng Chen","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Qifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086281005"},{"name":"Jia Xu","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086237702"},{"name":"Vladlen Koltun","affiliation":["Intel Labs"],"firstName":"Vladlen","lastName":"Koltun","id":"37739465900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237535","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":502},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237535","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Image resolution","Computer architecture","Training","Network architecture","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast image processing","fully-convolutional network","input-output pairs","trained network","network architecture","approximation accuracy","advanced image processing operators","multiple variational models","multiscale tone","detail manipulation","prior approximation schemes"]}],"abstract":"We present an approach to accelerating a wide variety of image processing operators.

The trained network operates at full resolution and runs in constant time. We investigate the effect of network architecture on approximation accuracy, runtime, and memory footprint, and identify a specific architecture that balances these considerations. We evaluate the presented approach on ten advanced image processing operators, including multiple variational models, multiscale tone and detail manipulation, photographic style transfer, nonlocal dehazing, and nonphoto-realistic stylization. All operators are approximated by the same model. Experiments demonstrate that the presented approach is significantly more accurate than prior approximation schemes. It increases approximation accuracy as measured by PSNR across the evaluated operators by 8.5 dB on the MIT-Adobe dataset (from 27.5 to 36 dB) and reduces DSSIM by a multiplicative factor of 3 compared to the most accurate prior approximation scheme, while being the fastest. We show that our models generalize across datasets and across resolutions, and investigate a number of extensions of the presented approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.273","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237535.pdf","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Image Processing with Fully-Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fast Image Processing with Fully-Convolutional Networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237535/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467945","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237535/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Image Processing with Fully-Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145807S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237536,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Liu","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085650232"},{"name":"Zhaowen Wang","affiliation":["Adobe Research"],"firstName":"Zhaowen","lastName":"Wang","id":"38065879200"},{"name":"Yuchen Fan","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Yuchen","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086013222"},{"name":"Xianming Liu","affiliation":["Facebook"],"firstName":"Xianming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086136004"},{"name":"Zhangyang Wang","affiliation":["Texas A&M University"],"firstName":"Zhangyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085444759"},{"name":"Shiyu Chang","affiliation":["IBM Research"],"firstName":"Shiyu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37086140267"},{"name":"Thomas Huang","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Huang","id":"37275421800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237536","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237536","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Adaptation models","Adaptive systems","Modulation","Computational modeling","Optical imaging","Motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image resolution","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video super-resolution","motion complexity","high-resolution frame","spatial alignment modules","public video datasets","learned temporal dynamics","input LR sequence","temporal adaptive neural network","low-resolution frames"]}],"abstract":"Video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate a high-resolution (HR) frame from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames in a local temporal window. The inter-frame temporal relation is as crucial as the intra-frame spatial relation for tackling this problem. However, how to utilize temporal information efficiently and effectively remains challenging since complex motion is difficult to model and can introduce adverse effects if not handled properly. We address this problem from two aspects. First, we propose a temporal adaptive neural network that can adaptively determine the optimal scale of temporal dependency. Filters on various temporal scales are applied to the input LR sequence before their responses are adaptively aggregated. Second, we reduce the complexity of motion between neighboring frames using a spatial alignment network which is much more robust and efficient than competing alignment methods and can be jointly trained with the temporal adaptive network in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed models with learned temporal dynamics are systematically evaluated on public video datasets and achieve state-of-the-art SR results compared with other recent video SR approaches. Both of the temporal adaptation and the spatial alignment modules are demonstrated to considerably improve SR quality over their plain counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.274","startPage":"2526","endPage":"2534","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237536.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Video Super-Resolution with Learned Temporal Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237536/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Video Super-Resolution with Learned Temporal Dynamics","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453247","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237536/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Video Super-Resolution with Learned Temporal Dynamics","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091075S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237537,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086295669"},{"name":"Lixuan Yi","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Lixuan","lastName":"Yi","id":"37086298094"},{"name":"Qi Xie","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085676275"},{"name":"Qian Zhao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085539189"},{"name":"Deyu Meng","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Deyu","lastName":"Meng","id":"38080754300"},{"name":"Zongben Xu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Xi'an Jiaotong University"],"firstName":"Zongben","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086305291"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237537","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Correlation","Cameras","Feature extraction","Stochastic processes","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","Gaussian processes","mixture models","object detection","rain","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rain variations","rain configurations","spatiotemporal smoothness configuration","low-rank structure","background scene","rain streak layer","moving object","computer vision","deterministic message","stochastic manner","video processing tasks","rain streak removal in a video","RSRV methods","Gaussians mixture"]}],"abstract":"Videos taken in the wild sometimes contain unexpected rain streaks, which brings difficulty in subsequent video processing tasks. Rain streak removal in a video (RSRV) is thus an important issue and has been attracting much attention in computer vision. Different from previous RSRV methods formulating rain streaks as a deterministic message, this work first encodes the rains in a stochastic manner, i.e., a patch-based mixture of Gaussians. Such modification makes the proposed model capable of finely adapting a wider range of rain variations instead of certain types of rain configurations as traditional. By integrating with the spatiotemporal smoothness configuration of moving objects and low-rank structure of background scene, we propose a concise model for RSRV, containing one likelihood term imposed on the rain streak layer and two prior terms on the moving object and background scene layers of the video. Experiments implemented on videos with synthetic and real rains verify the superiority of the proposed method, as compared with the state-of-the-art methods, both visually and quantitatively in various performance metrics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Should We Encode Rain Streaks in Video as Deterministic or Stochastic?","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.275","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237537.pdf","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Should We Encode Rain Streaks in Video as Deterministic or Stochastic?","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237537/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453261","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Should We Encode Rain Streaks in Video as Deterministic or Stochastic?","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108194S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":8237538,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality and Human Interaction Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085479102"},{"name":"Chi-Wing Fu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality and Human Interaction Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Wing","lastName":"Fu","id":"37336329800"},{"name":"Dani Lischinski","affiliation":["The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"],"firstName":"Dani","lastName":"Lischinski","id":"37418740700"},{"name":"Pheng-Ann Heng","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality and Human Interaction Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Pheng-Ann","lastName":"Heng","id":"37283077400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237538","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":523},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Dictionaries","Visualization","Optimization methods","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image denoising","image reconstruction","image restoration","optimisation","rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rain streaks removal","rain-streak detail removal","nonstreak detail removal","image regions identification","rain direction estimation","rain patches extraction","dominant rain streak direction","rain image","image priors","joint optimization process","rain-streak layer R","rain-free background layer B","single input image","single-image rain streak removal","Joint Bi-layer Optimization"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel method for removing rain streaks from a single input image by decomposing it into a rain-free background layer B and a rain-streak layer R. A joint optimization process is used that alternates between removing rain-streak details from B and removing non-streak details from R. The process is assisted by three novel image priors. Observing that rain streaks typically span a narrow range of directions, we first analyze the local gradient statistics in the rain image to identify image regions that are dominated by rain streaks. From these regions, we estimate the dominant rain streak direction and extract a collection of rain-dominated patches. Next, we define two priors on the background layer B, one based on a centralized sparse representation and another based on the estimated rain direction. A third prior is defined on the rain-streak layer R, based on similarity of patches to the extracted rain patches.

They only need a small set of training samples from the initial frame to generate an appearance model. However, existing DCFs learn the filters separately from feature extraction, and update these filters using a moving average operation with an empirical weight. These DCF trackers hardly benefit from the end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose the CREST algorithm to reformulate DCFs as a one-layer convolutional neural network. Our method integrates feature extraction, response map generation as well as model update into the neural networks for an end-to-end training. To reduce model degradation during online update, we apply residual learning to take appearance changes into account. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CREST tracker performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.279","startPage":"2574","endPage":"2583","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237541.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CREST: Convolutional Residual Learning for Visual Tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237541/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"CREST: Convolutional Residual Learning for Visual Tracking","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453126","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237541/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CREST: Convolutional Residual Learning for Visual Tracking","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088235S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237545,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086278011"},{"name":"Feng Zhou","affiliation":["Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086282929"},{"name":"Shilei Wen","affiliation":["Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Shilei","lastName":"Wen","id":"37086282441"},{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086226382"},{"name":"Yuanqing Lin","affiliation":["Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086281305"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237545","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Training","Computer vision","Robustness","Training data","Fasteners","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triplet loss","deep metric learning","angular loss","modern image search system","impressive performance gains","image data","similarity metric","contrastive loss","image pairs","triplet triangles","objective loss function","similarity measurement","high level abstraction extraction","similarity optimization","relative similarity optimization","third-order geometric constraint","scale invariance"]}],"abstract":"The modern image search system requires semantic understanding of image, and a key yet under-addressed problem is to learn a good metric for measuring the similarity between images. While deep metric learning has yielded impressive performance gains by extracting high level abstractions from image data, a proper objective loss function becomes the central issue to boost the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel angular loss, which takes angle relationship into account, for learning better similarity metric. Whereas previous metric learning methods focus on optimizing the similarity (contrastive loss) or relative similarity (triplet loss) of image pairs, our proposed method aims at constraining the angle at the negative point of triplet triangles. Several favorable properties are observed when compared with conventional methods. First, scale invariance is introduced, improving the robustness of objective against feature variance. Second, a third-order geometric constraint is inherently imposed, capturing additional local structure of triplet triangles than contrastive loss or triplet loss. Third, better convergence has been demonstrated by experiments on three publicly available datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Metric Learning with Angular Loss","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.283","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237545.pdf","startPage":"2612","endPage":"2620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep Metric Learning with Angular Loss","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237545/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467862","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Metric Learning with Angular Loss","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097942S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237547,"authors":[{"name":"Hedi Ben-younes","affiliation":["Heuritech"],"firstName":"Hedi","lastName":"Ben-younes","id":"37086292111"},{"name":"Remi Cadene","affiliation":["Sorbonne University, LIP6"],"firstName":"Remi","lastName":"Cadene","id":"37086330065"},{"name":"Matthieu Cord","affiliation":["Sorbonne University, LIP6"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Cord","id":"37267018000"},{"name":"Nicolas Thome","affiliation":["CNAM"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Thome","id":"37295916700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Visualization","Matrix decomposition","Complexity theory","Merging","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","image representation","question answering (information retrieval)","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MUTAN","multimodal Tucker fusion","visual question answering","bilinear models","mixing merging information","(VQA) tasks","question meaning","visual concepts","huge dimensionality issues","multimodal tensor","bilinear interactions","visual representations","textual representations","Tucker framework","low-rank matrix","interaction rank","Tucker decomposition framework","latest VQA architectures"]}],"abstract":"Bilinear models provide an appealing framework for mixing and merging information in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks.

Much to our surprise, we have found that, with current technology, \u201clifting\u201d ground truth 2djoint locations to 3d space is a task that can be solved with a remarkably low error rate: a relatively simple deep feedforward network outperforms the best reported result by about 30% on Human3.6M, the largest publicly available 3d pose estimation benchmark. Furthermore, training our system on the output of an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art 2d detector (i.e., using images as input) yields state of the art results - this includes an array of systems that have been trained end-to-end specifically for this task.

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D shape representation learning approach, Directionally Convolutional Network (DCN), to solve the shape segmentation problem. DCN extends convolution operations from images to the surface mesh of 3D shapes. With DCN, we learn effective shape representations from raw geometric features, i.e., face normals and distances, to achieve robust segmentation. More specifically, a two-stream segmentation framework is proposed: one stream is made up by the proposed DCN with the face normals as the input, and the other stream is implemented by a neural network with the face distance histogram as the input. The learned shape representations from the two streams are fused by an element-wise product. Finally, Conditional Random Field (CRF) is applied to optimize the segmentation. Through extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-arts (both classic and deep learning-based) on a large variety of 3D shapes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.294","startPage":"2717","endPage":"2726","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237556.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directionally Convolutional Networks for 3D Shape Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Shape","Three-dimensional displays","Convolution","Neural networks","Image segmentation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust segmentation","two-stream segmentation framework","neural network","face distance histogram","learned shape representations","3D shape segmentation","shape segmentation problem","convolution operations","raw geometric features","directionally convolutional networks","3D shape representation learning approach","directionally convolutional network","shape representations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Directionally Convolutional Networks for 3D Shape Segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237556/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467899","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directionally Convolutional Networks for 3D Shape Segmentation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112221S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8237560,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuang Liu","affiliation":["CSAI, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Zhuang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086228678"},{"name":"Jianguo Li","affiliation":["Intel Labs, China"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Li","id":"37538142300"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Shen","affiliation":["Fudan University"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085759002"},{"name":"Gao Huang","affiliation":["Cornell University"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086214867"},{"name":"Shoumeng Yan","affiliation":["Intel Labs, China"],"firstName":"Shoumeng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086336078"},{"name":"Changshui Zhang","affiliation":["CSAI, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Changshui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086045689"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237560","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":321,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Sparse matrices","Neurons","Quantization (signal)","Network architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural networks","CNNs","novel learning scheme","run-time memory footprint","channel-level sparsity","modern CNN architectures","network slimming","image classification datasets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237560","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237560.pdf","startPage":"2755","endPage":"2763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.298","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming","abstract":"The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in many real world applications is largely hindered by their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1) reduce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint; and 3) lower the number of computing operations, without compromising accuracy. This is achieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but effective way. Different from many existing approaches, the proposed method directly applies to modern CNN architectures, introduces minimum overhead to the training process, and requires no special software/hardware accelerators for the resulting models. We call our approach network slimming, which takes wide and large networks as input models, but during training insignificant channels are automatically identified and pruned afterwards, yielding thin and compact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models, including VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet, on various image classification datasets. For VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a 20\u00d7 reduction in model size and a 5\u00d7 reduction in computing operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237560/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17453295","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237560/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099224S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"321","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237561,"authors":[{"name":"Jianmin Bao","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Bao","id":"37086306991"},{"name":"Dong Chen","firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Fang Wen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wen","id":"37928941600"},{"name":"Houqiang Li","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Houqiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085451940"},{"name":"Gang Hua","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Hua","id":"37085704806"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237561","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":822},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Training","Hidden Markov models","Data models","Generators","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image coding","image matching","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CVAE-GAN","fine-grained image generation","asymmetric training","variational generative adversarial networks","general learning framework","variational auto-encoder","fine-grained categories","probabilistic model","fine-grained category label","latent attribute vector","cross entropy loss","classifier network","mean discrepancy objective","generative network","asymmetric loss function","GAN training","encoder network","natural images","image inpainting","face recognition models"]}],"abstract":"We present variational generative adversarial networks, a general learning framework that combines a variational auto-encoder with a generative adversarial network, for synthesizing images in fine-grained categories, such as faces of a specific person or objects in a category. Our approach models an image as a composition of label and latent attributes in a probabilistic model. By varying the fine-grained category label fed into the resulting generative model, we can generate images in a specific category with randomly drawn values on a latent attribute vector. Our approach has two novel aspects. First, we adopt a cross entropy loss for the discriminative and classifier network, but a mean discrepancy objective for the generative network. This kind of asymmetric loss function makes the GAN training more stable. Second, we adopt an encoder network to learn the relationship between the latent space and the real image space, and use pairwise feature matching to keep the structure of generated images. We experiment with natural images of faces, flowers, and birds, and demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and diverse samples with fine-grained category labels. We further show that our models can be applied to other tasks, such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and data augmentation for training better face recognition models.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.299","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237561.pdf","startPage":"2764","endPage":"2773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CVAE-GAN: Fine-Grained Image Generation through Asymmetric Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237561/","displayDocTitle":"CVAE-GAN: Fine-Grained Image Generation through Asymmetric Training","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467800","htmlLink":"/document/8237561/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CVAE-GAN: Fine-Grained Image Generation through Asymmetric Training","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07746S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237562,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Hendrik Metzen","affiliation":["Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Robert Bosch GmbH"],"firstName":"Jan Hendrik","lastName":"Metzen","id":"37947162700"},{"name":"Mummadi Chaithanya Kumar","affiliation":["University of Freiburg"],"firstName":"Mummadi Chaithanya","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086292718"},{"name":"Thomas Brox","affiliation":["Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Robert Bosch GmbH"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brox","id":"37541664500"},{"name":"Volker Fischer","affiliation":["Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Robert Bosch GmbH"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37085533518"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237562","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237562","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Perturbation methods","Image segmentation","Semantics","Training","Machine learning","Network architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target segmentation","generating adversarial perturbations","image classification","universal perturbations","deep learning","semantic image segmentation","universal adversarial perturbations","arbitrary inputs","barely perceptible universal noise patterns"]}],"abstract":"While deep learning is remarkably successful on perceptual tasks, it was also shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of the input. These perturbations denote noise added to the input that was generated specifically to fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible for humans. More severely, there even exist universal perturbations that are input-agnostic but fool the network on the majority of inputs. While recent work has focused on image classification, this work proposes attacks against semantic image segmentation: we present an approach for generating (universal) adversarial perturbations that make the network yield a desired target segmentation as output. We show empirically that there exist barely perceptible universal noise patterns which result in nearly the same predicted segmentation for arbitrary inputs. Furthermore, we also show the existence of universal noise which removes a target class (e.g., all pedestrians) from the segmentation while leaving the segmentation mostly unchanged otherwise.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.300","startPage":"2774","endPage":"2783","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237562.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal Adversarial Perturbations Against Semantic Image Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237562/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Universal Adversarial Perturbations Against Semantic Image Segmentation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467810","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal Adversarial Perturbations Against Semantic Image Segmentation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119507S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237563,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Haeusser","affiliation":["Google, Inc.","Dept. of Informatics, TU Munich"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Haeusser","id":"37086217723"},{"name":"Thomas Frerix","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics, TU Munich"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Frerix","id":"37086289391"},{"name":"Alexander Mordvintsev","affiliation":["Google, Inc."],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Mordvintsev","id":"37086228020"},{"name":"Daniel Cremers","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics, TU Munich"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Cremers","id":"37282875300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237563","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237563","abstract":"We propose associative domain adaptation, a novel technique for end-to-end domain adaptation with neural networks, the task of inferring class labels for an unlabeled target domain based on the statistical properties of a labeled source domain.

We accomplish this by reinforcing associations between source and target data directly in embedding space. Our method can easily be added to any existing classification network with no structural and almost no computational overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results across the board with a generic convolutional neural network architecture not specifically tuned to the respective tasks.

Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss function for the discriminator. We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. Second, LSGANs perform more stable during the learning process. We evaluate LSGANs on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets and the experimental results show that the images generated by LSGANs are of better quality than the ones generated by regular GANs.

Re-parameterization is an effective way to relieve the problem by learning the curvature approximately or constraining the solutions of weights with good properties for optimization. This paper proposes to reparameterize the input weight of each neuron in deep neural networks by normalizing it with zero-mean and unit-norm, followed by a learnable scalar parameter to adjust the norm of the weight. This technique effectively stabilizes the distribution implicitly. Besides, it improves the conditioning of the optimization problem and thus accelerates the training of deep neural networks. It can be wrapped as a linear module in practice and plugged in any architecture to replace the standard linear module. We highlight the benefits of our method on both multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, and demonstrate its scalability and efficiency on SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237567/","accessionNumber":"17467828","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237567/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Centered Weight Normalization in Accelerating Training of Deep Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centered Weight Normalization in Accelerating Training of Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c822.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070827S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237571,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Yuan Wu","affiliation":["UT Austin"],"firstName":"Chao-Yuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086308819"},{"name":"R.

Depending on the task complexity, thousands to millions of labeled image pairs are needed to train a conditional GAN. However, human labeling is expensive, even impractical, and large quantities of data may not always be available. Inspired by dual learning from natural language translation [23], we develop a novel dual-GAN mechanism, which enables image translators to be trained from two sets of unlabeled images from two domains. In our architecture, the primal GAN learns to translate images from domain U to those in domain V, while the dual GAN learns to invert the task. The closed loop made by the primal and dual tasks allows images from either domain to be translated and then reconstructed. Hence a loss function that accounts for the reconstruction error of images can be used to train the translators. Experiments on multiple image translation tasks with unlabeled data show considerable performance gain of DualGAN over a single GAN. For some tasks, DualGAN can even achieve comparable or slightly better results than conditional GAN trained on fully labeled data.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.310","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237572.pdf","startPage":"2868","endPage":"2876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DualGAN: Unsupervised Dual Learning for Image-to-Image Translation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DualGAN: Unsupervised Dual Learning for Image-to-Image Translation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237572/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467901","htmlLink":"/document/8237572/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DualGAN: Unsupervised Dual Learning for Image-to-Image Translation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c868.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073196S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"343","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237577,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Tudor Ionescu","affiliation":["SecurifAI, Bucharest, Romania","University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu Tudor","lastName":"Ionescu","id":"38289350500"},{"name":"Sorina Smeureanu","affiliation":["SecurifAI, Bucharest, Romania","University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Sorina","lastName":"Smeureanu","id":"37086272722"},{"name":"Bogdan Alexe","affiliation":["SecurifAI, Bucharest, Romania","University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Alexe","id":"38482493600"},{"name":"Marius Popescu","affiliation":["SecurifAI, Bucharest, Romania","University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Popescu","id":"37085527341"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237577","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Event detection","Training data","Computer vision","Anomaly detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","document image processing","feature extraction","image sequences","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abnormal event detection framework","unsupervised methods","supervised methods","computer vision task","consecutive video sequences","binary classifier","text documents","authorship verification","abnormal events"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel framework for abnormal event detection in video that requires no training sequences.

Here we explore the use of visual explanations. These explanations take the form of real-time highlighted regions of an image that causally influence the network's output (steering control). Our approach is two-stage. In the first stage, we use a visual attention model to train a convolution network end-to- end from images to steering angle. The attention model highlights image regions that potentially influence the network's output. Some of these are true influences, but some are spurious. We then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions actually influence the output. This produces more succinct visual explanations and more accurately exposes the network's behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on three datasets totaling 16 hours of driving. We first show that training with attention does not degrade the performance of the end-to-end network. Then we show that the network causally cues on a variety of features that are used by humans while driving.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453108","htmlLink":"/document/8237582/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interpretable Learning for Self-Driving Cars by Visualizing Causal Attention","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpretable Learning for Self-Driving Cars by Visualizing Causal Attention","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060767S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237583,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Das","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Das","id":"37086240113"},{"name":"Satwik Kottur","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Satwik","lastName":"Kottur","id":"37085689444"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

Specifically, we pose a cooperative `image guessing' game between two agents - Q-BOT and A-BOT- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Q-BOT can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end - from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.,,We demonstrate two experimental results.,,First, as a `sanity check' demonstration of pure RL (from scratch), we show results on a synthetic world, where the agents communicate in ungrounded vocabularies, i.e., symbols with no pre-specified meanings (X, Y, Z). We find that two bots invent their own communication protocol and start using certain symbols to ask/answer about certain visual attributes (shape/color/style). Thus, we demonstrate the emergence of grounded language and communication among `visual' dialog agents with no human supervision.,,Second, we conduct large-scale real-image experiments on the VisDial dataset [5], where we pretrain on dialog data with supervised learning (SL) and show that the RL finetuned agents significantly outperform supervised pretraining. Interestingly, the RL Q-BOT learns to ask questions that A-BOT is good at, ultimately resulting in more informative dialog and a better team.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237583.pdf","startPage":"2970","endPage":"2979","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Visualization","Receivers","Training","Natural languages","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems","natural language interfaces","robot vision","software agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual dialog agents","deep reinforcement learning","goal-driven training","visual question answering","cooperative image guessing game","A-BOT","natural language dialog","unseen image","multiagent multiround dialog","bots","communication protocol","visual attributes","grounded language","real-image experiments","dialog data","supervised learning","RL finetuned agents","informative dialog","supervised pretraining","RL Q-BOT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237583/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453026","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Cooperative Visual Dialog Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089443S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8237584,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"He","id":"37085360867"},{"name":"Georgia Gkioxari","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Gkioxari","id":"37075681800"},{"name":"Piotr Doll\u00e1r","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Doll\u00e1r","id":"37547761500"},{"name":"Ross Girshick","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Ross","lastName":"Girshick","id":"37546866400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237584","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3434,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17538},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237584","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Object detection","Semantics","Quantization (signal)","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image segmentation","object detection","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conceptually simple framework","bounding-box object detection","object mask","Faster R-CNN","called Mask R-CNN","high-quality segmentation mask","object instance segmentation"]}],"abstract":"We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.

Sentences produced by existing methods, e.g. those based on RNNs, are often overly rigid and lacking in variability. This issue is related to a learning principle widely used in practice, that is, to maximize the likelihood of training samples. This principle encourages high resemblance to the \u201cground-truth\u201d captions, while suppressing other reasonable descriptions. Conventional evaluation metrics, e.g. BLEU and METEOR, also favor such restrictive methods. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach, with the aim to improve the naturalness and diversity - two essential properties of human expression. Specifically, we propose a new framework based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), which jointly learns a generator to produce descriptions conditioned on images and an evaluator to assess how well a description fits the visual content. It is noteworthy that training a sequence generator is nontrivial. We overcome the difficulty by Policy Gradient, a strategy stemming from Reinforcement Learning, which allows the generator to receive early feedback along the way. We tested our method on two large datasets, where it performed competitively against real people in our user study and outperformed other methods on various tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.323","startPage":"2989","endPage":"2998","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237585.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Diverse and Natural Image Descriptions via a Conditional GAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Buildings","Training","Cows","Gallium nitride","Generators","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image retrieval","image sequences","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","maximum likelihood estimation","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural image descriptions","image captioning techniques","RNNs","learning principle","training samples","ground-truth captions","human expression","conditional GAN","likelihood maximization","conditional generative adversarial networks","reinforcement learning","diverse image descriptions","sequence generator training","policy gradient"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards Diverse and Natural Image Descriptions via a Conditional GAN","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237585/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453088","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Diverse and Natural Image Descriptions via a Conditional GAN","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074083S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":8237586,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Yi Lin","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086290170"},{"name":"Priya Goyal","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Priya","lastName":"Goyal","id":"37086284782"},{"name":"Ross Girshick","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Ross","lastName":"Girshick","id":"37546866400"},{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Kaiming","lastName":"He","id":"37086294463"},{"name":"Piotr Doll\u00e1r","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research (FAIR)"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Doll\u00e1r","id":"37547761500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237586","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1999,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237586","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Training","Entropy","Object detection","Proposals","Robustness","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","entropy","image classification","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense object detection","two-stage approach","classifier","sparse set","candidate object locations","extreme foreground-background class imbalance","focal loss","object detectors","R-CNN","dense detectors training","cross entropy loss reshaping"]}],"abstract":"The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.324","startPage":"2999","endPage":"3007","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237586.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237586/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453171","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237586/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032c999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108898S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"1999","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237589,"authors":[{"name":"Shenlong Wang","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Shenlong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085699650"},{"name":"Min Bai","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Bai","id":"37086217232"},{"name":"Gellert Mattyus","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Gellert","lastName":"Mattyus","id":"37085564132"},{"name":"Hang Chu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Chu","id":"37086297233"},{"name":"Wenjie Luo","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086299738"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086305527"},{"name":"Justin Liang","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37088727922"},{"name":"Joel Cheverie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Cheverie","id":"37088735804"},{"name":"Sanja Fidler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Sanja","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37689726500"},{"name":"Raquel Urtasun","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Raquel","lastName":"Urtasun","id":"37269502900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237589","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Benchmark testing","Roads","Laser radar","Semantics","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","geophysical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TorontoCity benchmark","greater Toronto area","GTA","high-precision maps","road centerline","curb extraction","semantic labeling","data sources","building height estimation","building instance segmentation","building contour extraction","scene type classification","convolutional neural networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we introduce the TorontoCity benchmark, which covers the full greater Toronto area (GTA) with 712.5km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of land, 8439km of road and around 400, 000 buildings.

In this paper we propose a ConvNet architecture that jointly performs detection and tracking, solving the task in a simple and effective way. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we set up a ConvNet architecture for simultaneous detection and tracking, using a multi-task objective for frame-based object detection and across-frame track regression; (ii) we introduce correlation features that represent object co-occurrences across time to aid the ConvNet during tracking; and (iii) we link the frame level detections based on our across-frame tracklets to produce high accuracy detections at the video level. Our ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal object detection is evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Our approach provides better single model performance than the winning method of the last ImageNet challenge while being conceptually much simpler. Finally, we show that by increasing the temporal stride we can dramatically increase the tracker speed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.330","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237592.pdf","startPage":"3057","endPage":"3065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detect to Track and Track to Detect","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237592/","displayDocTitle":"Detect to Track and Track to Detect","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453136","htmlLink":"/document/8237592/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detect to Track and Track to Detect","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100641S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8237593,"authors":[{"name":"Pan He","affiliation":["National Science Foundation Center for Big Learning, University of Florida"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"He","id":"37086265002"},{"name":"Weilin Huang","affiliation":["National Science Foundation Center for Big Learning, University of Florida"],"firstName":"Weilin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085431440"},{"name":"Tong He","affiliation":["National Science Foundation Center for Big Learning, University of Florida"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"He","id":"37085384140"},{"name":"Qile Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and Virtual Reality Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Qile","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086264253"},{"name":"Yu Qiao","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and Virtual Reality Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37086071529"},{"name":"Xiaolin Li","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and Virtual Reality Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086264357"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237593","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237593","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Convolutional codes","Predictive models","Heating systems","Computer vision","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","natural scenes","neural nets","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single shot text detector","regional attention","word-level bounding boxes","natural image","attention mechanism","text regions","background interference","convolutional features","hierarchical inception module","single-scale images","attentional map","FCN-based text detectors","multiscale inception features","Fully Convolutional Network"]}],"abstract":"We present a novel single-shot text detector that directly outputs word-level bounding boxes in a natural image.

Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical inception module which efficiently aggregates multi-scale inception features.

A reliable and low-cost monocular solution is critical for pervasive usage in these areas. Noticing that a gaze vector is a composition of head pose and eyeball movement in a geometrically deterministic way, we propose a novel gaze transform layer to connect separate head pose and eyeball movement models. The proposed decomposition does not suffer from head-gaze correlation overfitting and makes it possible to use datasets existing for other tasks. To add stronger supervision for better network training, we propose a two-step training strategy, which first trains sub-tasks with rough labels and then jointly trains with accurate gaze labels. To enable good cross-subject performance under various conditions, we collect a large dataset which has full coverage of head poses and eyeball movements, contains 200 subjects, and has diverse illumination conditions. Our deep solution achieves state-of-the-art gaze tracking accuracy, reaching 5.6\u00b0 cross-subject prediction error using a small network running at 1000 fps on a single CPU (excluding face alignment time) and 4.3\u00b0 cross-subject error with a deeper network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237603/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467951","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Monocular Free-Head 3D Gaze Tracking with Deep Learning and Geometry Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monocular Free-Head 3D Gaze Tracking with Deep Learning and Geometry Constraints","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122702S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8237606,"authors":[{"name":"Kaipeng Zhang","affiliation":["Tencent AI Lab"],"firstName":"Kaipeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085861445"},{"name":"Zhanpeng Zhang","affiliation":["Tencent AI Lab"],"firstName":"Zhanpeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087904245"},{"name":"Hao Wang","affiliation":["Tencent AI Lab"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087905393"},{"name":"Zhifeng Li","affiliation":["Tencent AI Lab"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37086268380"},{"name":"Yu Qiao","affiliation":["Sense Time Group Limited"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37401299900"},{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Vision and Virtual Reality Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37087904118"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237606","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Faces Using Inside Cascaded Contextual CNN","abstract":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve substantial improvements in face detection in the wild. Classical CNN-based face detection methods simply stack successive layers of filters where an input sample should pass through all layers before reaching a face/non-face decision. Inspired by the fact that for face detection, filters in deeper layers can discriminate between difficult face/non-face samples while those in shallower layers can efficiently reject simple non-face samples, we propose Inside Cascaded Structure that introduces face/non-face classifiers at different layers within the same CNN. In the training phase, we propose data routing mechanism which enables different layers to be trained by different types of samples, and thus deeper layers can focus on handling more difficult samples compared with traditional architecture. In addition, we introduce a two-stream contextual CNN architecture that leverages body part information adaptively to enhance face detection. Extensive experiments on the challenging FD-DB and WIDER FACE benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art techniques while keeps real time performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face detection","Training","Integrated circuits","Feature extraction","Routing","Computer architecture","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","face recognition","image classification","image enhancement","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection methods","deeper layers","shallower layers","face samples","face decision","nonface decision","inside cascaded contextual CNN","nonface samples","face classifiers","nonface classifiers","deep convolutional neural networks","face detection enhancement","WIDER FACE benchmarks","two-stream contextual CNN architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237606","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.344","startPage":"3190","endPage":"3198","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237606.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237606/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Faces Using Inside Cascaded Contextual CNN","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453177","htmlLink":"/document/8237606/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Faces Using Inside Cascaded Contextual CNN","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092667S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237609,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Jourabloo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, MI"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Jourabloo","id":"37075747300"},{"name":"Mao Ye","affiliation":["Bosch Research North America, Palo Alto, CA"],"firstName":"Mao","lastName":"Ye","id":"37086056004"},{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, MI"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37076098000"},{"name":"Liu Ren","affiliation":["Bosch Research North America, Palo Alto, CA"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Ren","id":"37086278570"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237609","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Shape","Two dimensional displays","Training","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","optimisation","pose estimation","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["head poses","dense 3D face shape","single CNN","pose-invariant face alignment","multiple CNN architectures","typical cascade","training time","different loss functions","CNN architecture","named visualization layer","slow training speed","handcrafted features","end-to-end training","CNNs suffers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.347","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237609.pdf","startPage":"3219","endPage":"3228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pose-Invariant Face Alignment with a Single CNN","abstract":"Face alignment has witnessed substantial progress in the last decade.

Nonetheless, the cascade of CNNs suffers from several drawbacks, e.g., lack of end-to-end training, handcrafted features and slow training speed. To address these issues, we propose a new layer, named visualization layer, which can be integrated into the CNN architecture and enables joint optimization with different loss functions. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method on multiple datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, while reducing the training time by more than half compared to the typical cascade of CNNs.

Unlike most other deep learning strategies applied in this context, our approach tackles these challenging problems by estimating edges and reconstructing images using only cascaded convolutional layers arranged such that no handcrafted or application-specific image-processing components are required. We apply the resulting transferrable pipeline to two different problem domains that are both sensitive to edges, namely, single image reflection removal and image smoothing. For the former, using a mild reflection smoothness assumption and a novel synthetic data generation method that acts as a type of weak supervision, our network is able to solve much more difficult reflection cases that cannot be handled by previous methods. For the latter, we also exceed the state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative results by wide margins. In all cases, the proposed framework is simple, fast, and easy to transfer across disparate domains.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237613.pdf","startPage":"3258","endPage":"3267","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Deep Architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal and Image Smoothing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Smoothing methods","Image reconstruction","Image color analysis","Pipelines","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","edge detection","image reconstruction","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transferrable pipeline","weak supervision","image smoothing","single image reflection removal","handcrafted application-specific image-processing components","cascaded convolutional layers","reconstructing images","deep learning strategies","layer separation","low-level vision tasks","edge information","deep neural network structure","generic deep architecture","mild reflection smoothness assumption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Generic Deep Architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal and Image Smoothing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237613/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467879","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Deep Architecture for Single Image Reflection Removal and Image Smoothing","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081597S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237617,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Ignatov","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Ignatov","id":"37086295732"},{"name":"Nikolay Kobyshev","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Kobyshev","id":"37085336411"},{"name":"Radu Timofte","affiliation":["Comput.

In this work we present an end-to-end deep learning approach that bridges this gap by translating ordinary photos into DSLR-quality images. We propose learning the translation function using a residual convolutional neural network that improves both color rendition and image sharpness. Since the standard mean squared loss is not well suited for measuring perceptual image quality, we introduce a composite perceptual error function that combines content, color and texture losses. The first two losses are defined analytically, while the texture loss is learned in an adversarial fashion. We also present DPED, a large-scale dataset that consists of real photos captured from three different phones and one high-end reflex camera. Our quantitative and qualitative assessments reveal that the enhanced image quality is comparable to that of DSLR-taken photos, while the methodology is generalized to any type of digital camera.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.355","startPage":"3297","endPage":"3305","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237617.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSLR-Quality Photos on Mobile Devices with Deep Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237617/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DSLR-Quality Photos on Mobile Devices with Deep Convolutional Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453212","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237617/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSLR-Quality Photos on Mobile Devices with Deep Convolutional Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108956S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237618,"authors":[{"name":"Yuval Bahat","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Yuval","lastName":"Bahat","id":"37085770523"},{"name":"Netalee Efrat","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Netalee","lastName":"Efrat","id":"37086285695"},{"name":"Michal Irani","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Math, The Weizmann Institute of Science, ISRAEL"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Irani","id":"37282593100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237618","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":592},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Estimation","Image restoration","Training data","Convolution","Spectral analysis","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CNN-based blind-deblurring","reblurring","blind-deblurring algorithm","recovered sharp image","estimated blur-field","internal image-specific patch-recurrence","nonuniform deblurring algorithm","deep-learning methods","superior blur-field estimation results","blur sizes","training data","blurry image patches","nonuniform blur-field","unknown blur-field","nonuniform blurs","blind image deblurring","nonuniform blind deblurring"]}],"abstract":"We present an approach for blind image deblurring, which handles non-uniform blurs.

Our blur-field estimation is based on analyzing the spectral content of blurry image patches by Re-blurring them. Being unrestricted by any training data, it can handle a large variety of blur sizes, yielding superior blur-field estimation results compared to training-based deep-learning methods. Our non-uniform deblurring algorithm is based on the internal image-specific patch-recurrence prior. It attempts to recover a sharp image which, on one hand - results in the blurry image under our estimated blur-field, and on the other hand - maximizes the internal recurrence of patches within and across scales of the recovered sharp image.

However, since these approaches try to model all the structure and scene dynamics at once, in unconstrained settings they often generate uninterpretable results. Our insight is that forecasting needs to be done first at a higher level of abstraction. Specifically, we exploit human pose detectors as a free source of supervision and break the video forecasting problem into two discrete steps. First we explicitly model the high level structure of active objects in the scene (humans) and use a VAE to model the possible future movements of humans in the pose space. We then use the future poses generated as conditional information to a GAN to predict the future frames of the video in pixel space. By using the structured space of pose as an intermediate representation, we sidestep the problems that GANs have in generating video pixels directly. We show through quantitative and qualitative evaluation that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for video prediction.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237623","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237623.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.361","startPage":"3352","endPage":"3361","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Pose Knows: Video Forecasting by Generating Pose Futures","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237623/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467755","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Pose Knows: Video Forecasting by Generating Pose Futures","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089575S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":8237625,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Bahri","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bahri","id":"37086212291"},{"name":"Yannis Panagakis","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK","Middlesex University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yannis","lastName":"Panagakis","id":"37670940200"},{"name":"Stefanos Zafeiriou","affiliation":["Imperial College, London, UK","University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Zafeiriou","id":"37299691200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237625","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237625","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Dictionaries","Robustness","Machine learning","Sparse matrices","Matrix decomposition","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image denoising","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis","singular value decomposition","sparse matrices","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust Kronecker-decomposable Component analysis","unknown support","signal processing","SVD computations","tensor factorization","image denoising","background subtraction","novel Kronecker-decomposable component analysis","sparse dictionary learning","robust decomposition","unknown magnitude","sparse corruptions","low-rank matrix","PCP","Principal Component Pursuit","Singular Value Decomposition","sparse coding","K-SVD","statistical machine learning","computer vision","image processing","active research fields","low-rank modeling"]}],"abstract":"Dictionary learning and component analysis are part of one of the most well-studied and active research fields, at the intersection of signal and image processing, computer vision, and statistical machine learning. In dictionary learning, the current methods of choice are arguably K-SVD and its variants, which learn a dictionary (i.e., a decomposition) for sparse coding via Singular Value Decomposition. In robust component analysis, leading methods derive from Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), which recovers a low-rank matrix from sparse corruptions of unknown magnitude and support. However, K-SVD is sensitive to the presence of noise and outliers in the training set. Additionally, PCP does not provide a dictionary that respects the structure of the data (e.g., images), and requires expensive SVD computations when solved by convex relaxation. In this paper, we introduce a new robust decomposition of images by combining ideas from sparse dictionary learning and PCP. We propose a novel Kronecker-decomposable component analysis which is robust to gross corruption, can be used for low-rank modeling, and leverages separability to solve significantly smaller problems. We design an efficient learning algorithm by drawing links with a restricted form of tensor factorization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on real-world applications, namely background subtraction and image denoising, by performing a thorough comparison with the current state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.363","startPage":"3372","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.363","endPage":"3381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Kronecker-Decomposable Component Analysis for Low-Rank Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Kronecker-Decomposable Component Analysis for Low-Rank Modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237625/","accessionNumber":"17467852","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Kronecker-Decomposable Component Analysis for Low-Rank Modeling","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.149242S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237626,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodan Liang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086245334"},{"name":"Zhiting Hu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University","Petuum Inc"],"firstName":"Zhiting","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086284150"},{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University","Petuum Inc"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086279168"},{"name":"Chuang Gan","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Gan","id":"37085611353"},{"name":"Eric P.

Existing image description methods are largely restricted by small sets of biased visual paragraph annotations, and fail to cover rich underlying semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph generative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative results on telling diverse stories for an image verify the interpretability of RTT-GAN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Topic-Transition GAN for Visual Paragraph Generation","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.364","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237626.pdf","startPage":"3382","endPage":"3391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Topic-Transition GAN for Visual Paragraph Generation","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237626/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452986","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Topic-Transition GAN for Visual Paragraph Generation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112988S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237631,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Further improvements have been proposed to condition GANs to generate images matching a specific object category or a short text description. In this work, we build on the latter class of approaches and investigate the possibility of driving and conditioning the image generation process by means of brain signals recorded, through an electroencephalograph (EEG), while users look at images from a set of 40 ImageNet object categories with the objective of generating the seen images. To accomplish this task, we first demonstrate that brain activity EEG signals encode visually-related information that allows us to accurately discriminate between visual object categories and, accordingly, we extract a more compact class-dependent representation of EEG data using recurrent neural networks. Afterwards, we use the learned EEG manifold to condition image generation employing GANs, which, during inference, will read EEG signals and convert them into images. We tested our generative approach using EEG signals recorded from six subjects while looking at images of the aforementioned 40 visual classes. The results show that for classes represented by well-defined visual patterns (e.g., pandas, airplane, etc.), the generated images are realistic and highly resemble those evoking the EEG signals used for conditioning GANs, resulting in an actual reading-the-mind process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453147","htmlLink":"/document/8237631/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generative Adversarial Networks Conditioned by Brain Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generative Adversarial Networks Conditioned by Brain Signals","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085142S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237632,"authors":[{"name":"Yining Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yining","lastName":"Li","id":"37086069173"},{"name":"Chen Huang","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086276968"},{"name":"Xiaoou Tang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaoou","lastName":"Tang","id":"37280008500"},{"name":"Chen Change Loy","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chen Change","lastName":"Loy","id":"37411337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237632","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image color analysis","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Image resolution","Knowledge discovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","question answering (information retrieval)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual instances","image captioning","nondiscriminative questions","visual discriminative question generation","discriminative images-question tuples","visual question answering datasets","discriminative questions asking","annotated images-question tuples","positive samples","negative samples"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237632","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237632.pdf","startPage":"3439","endPage":"3448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Disambiguate by Asking Discriminative Questions","abstract":"The ability to ask questions is a powerful tool to gather information in order to learn about the world and resolve ambiguities.

Most approaches in industry focus on leveraging expensive sensors mounted on top of a fleet of cars. This results in very accurate estimates when exploiting a user in the loop. However, these solutions are very expensive and have small coverage. In contrast, in this paper we propose an approach that directly estimates road topology from aerial images. This provides us with an affordable solution with large coverage. Towards this goal, we take advantage of the latest developments in deep learning to have an initial segmentation of the aerial images. We then propose an algorithm that reasons about missing connections in the extracted road topology as a shortest path problem that can be solved efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the challenging TorontoCity dataset [23] and show very significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237634.pdf","startPage":"3458","endPage":"3466","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeepRoadMapper: Extracting Road Topology from Aerial Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Image segmentation","Topology","Network topology","Feature extraction","Image edge detection","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","road traffic","road vehicles","topology","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerial images","extracted road topology","DeepRoadMapper","creating road maps","autonomous driving","city planning","industry focus","expensive sensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DeepRoadMapper: Extracting Road Topology from Aerial Images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237634/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467747","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepRoadMapper: Extracting Road Topology from Aerial Images","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062385S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":8237636,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeonwoo Noh","affiliation":["POSTECH, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeonwoo","lastName":"Noh","id":"37085615948"},{"name":"Andre Araujo","affiliation":["POSTECH, Korea"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Araujo","id":"37086280080"},{"name":"Jack Sim","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Sim","id":"37086226074"},{"name":"Tobias Weyand","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Weyand","id":"38235026500"},{"name":"Bohyung Han","affiliation":["Google Inc."],"firstName":"Bohyung","lastName":"Han","id":"37279223700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237636","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":725},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image retrieval","Visualization","Clutter","Training","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image matching","image retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["landmark image dataset","attention mechanism","network layers","keypoint detectors","geometric verification","large-scale dataset","Google-Landmarks dataset","variable scales","global descriptors","local descriptors","large-scale image retrieval","attentive local feature descriptor","convolutional neural networks","image-level annotations","attentive deep local features","feature matching","DELE"]}],"abstract":"We propose an attentive local feature descriptor suitable for large-scale image retrieval, referred to as DELE (DEep Local Feature).

Following a commonly used framework of handling partial occlusions by part detection, we propose a multi-label learning approach to jointly learn part detectors to capture partial occlusion patterns. The part detectors share a set of decision trees via boosting to exploit part correlations and also reduce the computational cost of applying these part detectors. The learned decision trees capture the overall distribution of all the parts. When used as a pedestrian detector individually, our part detectors learned jointly show better performance than their counterparts learned separately in different occlusion situations. The learned part detectors can be further integrated to better detect partially occluded pedestrians. Experiments on the Caltech dataset show state-of-the-art performance of our approach for detecting heavily occluded pedestrians.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.377","startPage":"3506","endPage":"3515","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237639.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-label Learning of Part Detectors for Heavily Occluded Pedestrian Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Decision trees","Feature extraction","Boosting","Training","Correlation","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","pedestrians","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial occlusion patterns","multilabel learning approach","part correlations","learned decision trees","heavily occluded pedestrian detection","computational cost reduction","Caltech dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-label Learning of Part Detectors for Heavily Occluded Pedestrian Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237639/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467774","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-label Learning of Part Detectors for Heavily Occluded Pedestrian Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087095S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8237640,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Liu","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085680966"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["Youtu Lab, Tencent","The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"},{"name":"Sanja Fidler","affiliation":["University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Sanja","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37689726500"},{"name":"Raquel Urtasun","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Raquel","lastName":"Urtasun","id":"37269502900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237640","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Semantics","Neural networks","Complexity theory","Labeling","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SGN","sequential grouping networks","object instance segmentation","sub-grouping problem","horizontal object breakpoints","vertical object breakpoints","line segments","PASCAL VOC","neural network sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose Sequential Grouping Networks (SGN) to tackle the problem of object instance segmentation. SGNs employ a sequence of neural networks, each solving a sub-grouping problem of increasing semantic complexity in order to gradually compose objects out of pixels. In particular, the first network aims to group pixels along each image row and column by predicting horizontal and vertical object breakpoints. These breakpoints are then used to create line segments. By exploiting two-directional information, the second network groups horizontal and vertical lines into connected components. Finally, the third network groups the connected components into object instances. Our experiments show that our SGN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both, the Cityscapes dataset as well as PASCAL VOC.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.378","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237640.pdf","startPage":"3516","endPage":"3524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SGN: Sequential Grouping Networks for Instance Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"SGN: Sequential Grouping Networks for Instance Segmentation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237640/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17452990","htmlLink":"/document/8237640/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SGN: Sequential Grouping Networks for Instance Segmentation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093064S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237643,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Kumar Singh","affiliation":["University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Krishna Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085773028"},{"name":"Yong Jae Lee","affiliation":["University of California, Davis"],"firstName":"Yong Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086038489"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237643","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Videos","Testing","Dogs","Face","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weakly-supervised framework","weakly-supervised methods","discriminative part","training image","input image","weakly-supervised object localization","weakly-supervised action localization","hide-and-seek"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237643","abstract":"We propose `Hide-and-Seek', a weakly-supervised framework that aims to improve object localization in images and action localization in videos.

Our approach only needs to modify the input image and can work with any network designed for object localization. During testing, we do not need to hide any patches.

Recounting of abnormal events, i.e., explaining why they are judged to be abnormal, is an unexplored but critical task in video surveillance, because it helps human observers quickly judge if they are false alarms or not. To describe the events in the human-understandable form for event recounting, learning generic knowledge about visual concepts (e.g., object and action) is crucial. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved promising results in learning such concepts, it remains an open question as to how to effectively use CNNs for abnormal event detection, mainly due to the environment-dependent nature of the anomaly detection. In this paper, we tackle this problem by integrating a generic CNN model and environment-dependent anomaly detectors. Our approach first learns CNN with multiple visual tasks to exploit semantic information that is useful for detecting and recounting abnormal events. By appropriately plugging the model into anomaly detectors, we can detect and recount abnormal events while taking advantage of the discriminative power of CNNs. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on Avenue and UCSD Ped2 benchmarks for abnormal event detection and also produces promising results of abnormal event recounting.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237653.pdf","startPage":"3639","endPage":"3647","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Detection and Recounting of Abnormal Events by Learning Deep Generic Knowledge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Anomaly detection","Event detection","Visualization","Detectors","Videos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","video signal processing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep generic knowledge learning","video surveillance","convolutional neural networks","CNN","anomaly detection","abnormal event detection","joint detection","abnormal events","abnormal event recounting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Detection and Recounting of Abnormal Events by Learning Deep Generic Knowledge","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237653/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453284","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Detection and Recounting of Abnormal Events by Learning Deep Generic Knowledge","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082344S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237655,"authors":[{"name":"Gurkirt Singh","affiliation":["Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Gurkirt","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086322316"},{"name":"Suman Saha","affiliation":["Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Saha","id":"37086321114"},{"name":"Michael Sapienza","affiliation":["Oxford Brookes University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Sapienza","id":"37085828812"},{"name":"Philip Torr","affiliation":["And is currently with the Think Tank Team, Samsung Research America, University of Oxford, CA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Torr","id":"37371855600"},{"name":"Fabio Cuzzolin","affiliation":["University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Cuzzolin","id":"37418375200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237655","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Streaming media","Electron tubes","Proposals","Optical imaging","Detectors","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time SSD","Single Shot MultiBox Detector","video frame","action tubes","SSD frame level detections","S/T detection","online S/T action localisation","online real-time multiple spatiotemporal action localisation","deep-learning framework","online algorithm","multiple spatiotemporal action classification","detection boxes classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237655","abstract":"We present a deep-learning framework for real-time multiple spatio-temporal (S/T) action localisation and classification.

Citycam videos have low resolution, low frame rate, high occlusion and large perspective, making most existing methods lose their efficacy. To overcome limitations of existing methods and incorporate the temporal information of traffic video, we design a novel FCN-rLSTM network to jointly estimate vehicle density and vehicle count by connecting fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) with long short term memory networks (LSTM) in a residual learning fashion. Such design leverages the strengths of FCN for pixel-level prediction and the strengths of LSTM for learning complex temporal dynamics. The residual learning connection reformulates the vehicle count regression as learning residual functions with reference to the sum of densities in each frame, which significantly accelerates the training of networks. To preserve feature map resolution, we propose a Hyper-Atrous combination to integrate atrous convolution in FCN and combine feature maps of different convolution layers. FCN-rLSTM enables refined feature representation and a novel end-to-end trainable mapping from pixels to vehicle count. We extensively evaluated the proposed method on different counting tasks with three datasets, with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness and robustness. In particular, FCN-rLSTM reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) from 5.31 to 4.21 on TRANCOS; and reduces the MAE from 2.74 to 1.53 on WebCamT.

To perform this mapping, we use convolutional neural networks trained to capture the appearance of the target identity from an unstructured collection of his/her photographs. This approach is enabled by framing the face swapping problem in terms of style transfer, where the goal is to render an image in the style of another one. Building on recent advances in this area, we devise a new loss function that enables the network to produce highly photorealistic results. By combining neural networks with simple pre- and post-processing steps, we aim at making face swap work in real-time with no input from the user.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.397","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237659.pdf","startPage":"3697","endPage":"3705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Face-Swap Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fast Face-Swap Using Convolutional Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237659/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467756","htmlLink":"/document/8237659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Face-Swap Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d697.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081362S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237662,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Bulat","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, The University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bulat","id":"37086322545"},{"name":"Georgios Tzimiropoulos","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, The University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Tzimiropoulos","id":"37396761900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237662","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"abstract":"Our goal is to design architectures that retain the groundbreaking performance of CNNs for landmark localization and at the same time are lightweight, compact and suitable for applications with limited computational resources.

However, previous works mainly utilize video-level category as supervision to train RNNs, which may prohibit RNNs to learn complex motion structures along time. In this paper, we propose a recurrent pose-attention network (RPAN) to address this challenge, where we introduce a novel pose-attention mechanism to adaptively learn pose-related features at every time-step action prediction of RNNs. More specifically, we make three main contributions in this paper. Firstly, unlike previous works on pose-related action recognition, our RPAN is an end-to-end recurrent network which can exploit important spatial-temporal evolutions of human pose to assist action recognition in a unified framework. Secondly, instead of learning individual human-joint features separately, our pose-attention mechanism learns robust human-part features by sharing attention parameters partially on the semantically-related human joints. These human-part features are then fed into the human-part pooling layer to construct a highly-discriminative pose-related representation for temporal action modeling. Thirdly, one important byproduct of our RPAN is pose estimation in videos, which can be used for coarse pose annotation in action videos. We evaluate the proposed RPAN quantitatively and qualitatively on two popular benchmarks, i.e., Sub-JHMDB and PennAction. Experimental results show that RPAN outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on these challenging datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237664.pdf","startPage":"3745","endPage":"3754","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RPAN: An End-to-End Recurrent Pose-Attention Network for Action Recognition in Videos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Robustness","Heating systems","Computer vision","Recurrent neural networks","Pose estimation","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image motion analysis","pose estimation","recurrent neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RPAN","Recurrent Neural Networks","RNNs","video-level category","complex motion structures","pose-attention mechanism","time-step action prediction","pose-related action recognition","human-joint features","robust human-part features","attention parameters","human-part pooling layer","temporal action modeling","action videos","recurrent pose-attention network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"RPAN: An End-to-End Recurrent Pose-Attention Network for Action Recognition in Videos","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237664/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453291","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RPAN: An End-to-End Recurrent Pose-Attention Network for Action Recognition in Videos","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169671S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":8237665,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Nhan Duong","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Chi Nhan","lastName":"Duong","id":"38553221900"},{"name":"Kha Gia Quach","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Kha Gia","lastName":"Quach","id":"38556625700"},{"name":"Khoa Luu","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Khoa","lastName":"Luu","id":"37529698100"},{"name":"T.

In order to efficiently address the problem, this work first decomposes the aging process into multiple short-term stages. Then, a novel generative probabilistic model, named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving (TNVP) transformation, is presented to model the facial aging process at each stage. Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which requires an empirical balance threshold, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), an intractable model, our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function, exact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations between faces in consecutive stages. Our model shows its advantages not only in capturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing a smooth synthesis in age progression across faces. Our approach can model any face in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points. Moreover, the structure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping the advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density estimation. Our method is evaluated in both terms of synthesizing age-progressed faces and cross-age face verification and consistently shows the state-of-the-art results in various face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, MORPH, AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW), and Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD). A large-scale face verification on Megaface challenge 1 is also performed to further show the advantages of our proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Non-volume Preserving Approach to Facial Age-Progression and Age-Invariant Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.403","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237665.pdf","startPage":"3755","endPage":"3763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Non-volume Preserving Approach to Facial Age-Progression and Age-Invariant Face Recognition","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237665/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467976","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Non-volume Preserving Approach to Facial Age-Progression and Age-Invariant Face Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141508S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237667,"authors":[{"name":"Zhedong Zheng","affiliation":["Centre for Artificial Intelligence, University of Technology, Sydney"],"firstName":"Zhedong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086312838"},{"name":"Liang Zheng","affiliation":["Centre for Artificial Intelligence, University of Technology, Sydney"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38560564200"},{"name":"Yi Yang","affiliation":["Centre for Artificial Intelligence, University of Technology, Sydney"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085654000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237667","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":431,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Gallium nitride","Pipelines","Data models","Semisupervised learning","Generators","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image representation","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["person re-identification baseline","simple semisupervised pipeline","newly generated data","label smoothing regularization","uniform label distribution","unlabeled images","supervised model","deep convolutional generative adversarial network","baseline convolutional neural network","representation learning","learned CNN embeddings","Person-reID_GAN"]}],"abstract":"The main contribution of this paper is a simple semi-supervised pipeline that only uses the original training set without collecting extra data. It is challenging in 1) how to obtain more training data only from the training set and 2) how to use the newly generated data. In this work, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate unlabeled samples. We propose the label smoothing regularization for outliers (LSRO). This method assigns a uniform label distribution to the unlabeled images, which regularizes the supervised model and improves the baseline. We verify the proposed method on a practical problem: person re-identification (re-ID). This task aims to retrieve a query person from other cameras. We adopt the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for sample generation, and a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) for representation learning. Experiments show that adding the GAN-generated data effectively improves the discriminative ability of learned CNN embeddings. On three large-scale datasets, Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID, we obtain +4.37%, +1.6% and +2.46% improvement in rank-1 precision over the baseline CNN, respectively.

We specially design a spatiotemporal transformer module with recurrent connections between neighboring time slices which can actively transform a 3D feature map into a canonical view in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To validate our method, we introduce a new dataset with sufficient size, variation and reality, which contains 83 gestures designed for interaction with wearable devices, and more than 24,000 RGB-D gesture samples from 50 subjects captured in 6 scenes. On this dataset, we show that the proposed network outperforms competing state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GTEA egocentric action dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.406","startPage":"3783","endPage":"3791","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237668.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Egocentric Gesture Recognition Using Recurrent 3D Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Transformer Modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237668/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Egocentric Gesture Recognition Using Recurrent 3D Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Transformer Modules","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237668/","accessionNumber":"17467836","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Egocentric Gesture Recognition Using Recurrent 3D Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Transformer Modules","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1897S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8237670,"authors":[{"name":"Yongming Rao","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Beijing, China","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongming","lastName":"Rao","id":"37086274270"},{"name":"Ji Lin","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Beijing, China","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086218929"},{"name":"Jiwen Lu","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Beijing, China","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiwen","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404390100"},{"name":"Jie Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Beijing, China","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278266700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237670","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Face recognition","Measurement","Aggregates","Face","Convolution","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DAN method","raw video frame aggregation","aggregation methods","video face recognition","discriminative aggregation network method","recognition performance","video clips","discriminative images","aggregation process","misleading information","low-quality frames","recognition procedure","raw input frames","discriminative synthesized images","adversarial learning","metric learning","complex processing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a discriminative aggregation network (DAN) method for video face recognition, which aims to integrate information from video frames effectively and efficiently. Unlike existing aggregation methods, our method aggregates raw video frames directly instead of the features obtained by complex processing. By combining the idea of metric learning and adversarial learning, we learn an aggregation network that produces more discriminative synthesized images compared to raw input frames. Our framework reduces the number of frames to be processed and significantly speed up the recognition procedure. Furthermore, low-quality frames containing misleading information are filtered and denoised during the aggregation process, which makes our system more robust and discriminative. Experimental results show that our method can generate discriminative images from video clips and improve the overall recognition performance in both the speed and accuracy on three widely used datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.408","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237670.pdf","startPage":"3801","endPage":"3810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Discriminative Aggregation Network for Video-Based Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237670/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Discriminative Aggregation Network for Video-Based Face Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467772","htmlLink":"/document/8237670/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Discriminative Aggregation Network for Video-Based Face Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12156S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237671,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Haris Khan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, COMSATS Lahore Campus, Pakistan","Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad Haris","lastName":"Khan","id":"37085461649"},{"name":"John McDonagh","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"McDonagh","id":"37086334510"},{"name":"Georgios Tzimiropoulos","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Tzimiropoulos","id":"37396761900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237671","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237671","abstract":"An open question in facial landmark localization in video is whether one should perform tracking or tracking-by-detection (i.e. face alignment). Tracking produces fittings of high accuracy but is prone to drifting. Tracking-by-detection is drift-free but results in low accuracy fittings. To provide a solution to this problem, we describe the very first, to the best of our knowledge, synergistic approach between detection (face alignment) and tracking which completely eliminates drifting from face tracking, and does not merely perform tracking-by-detection. Our first main contribution is to show that one can achieve this synergy between detection and tracking using a principled optimization framework based on the theory of Global Variable Consensus Optimization using ADMM; Our second contribution is to show how the proposed analytic framework can be integrated within state-of-the-art discriminative methods for face alignment and tracking based on cascaded regression and deeply learned features. Overall, we call our method Discriminative Global Consensus Model (DGCM). Our third contribution is to show that DGCM achieves large performance improvement over the currently best performing face tracking methods on the most challenging category of the 300-VW dataset.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.409","startPage":"3811","endPage":"3819","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237671.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synergy between Face Alignment and Tracking via Discriminative Global Consensus Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Optimization","Shape","Deformable models","Training","Convex functions","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face alignment","tracking-by-detection","drift-free but results","face tracking","discriminative global consensus model","discriminative global consensus optimization","global variable consensus optimization","VW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Synergy between Face Alignment and Tracking via Discriminative Global Consensus Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237671/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467827","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergy between Face Alignment and Tracking via Discriminative Global Consensus Optimization","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068533S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8237672,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Sun","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086270081"},{"name":"Liang Zheng","affiliation":["Universiry of Technology Sydney"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38560564200"},{"name":"Weijian Deng","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Deng","id":"37086269166"},{"name":"Shengjin Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Shengjin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280458700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237672","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":247,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":470},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237672","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Matrix decomposition","Euclidean distance","Testing","Correlation","Rail to rail inputs","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image recognition","image representation","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","singular value decomposition","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative FC descriptors","projection vectors","DukeMTMC-reID datasets","CNN training","RRI","Singular Vector Decomposition","deep representation learning process","Euclidean distance","retrieval performance","FC descriptor","projection basis","convolutional neuron network","fully connected layer","weight vector","person re-identification","retrieval problems","pedestrian retrieval","SVDNet","Market-1501 dataset"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the SVDNet for retrieval problems, with focus on the application of person re-identification (reID).

This problem leads to correlations among entries of the FC descriptor, and compromises the retrieval performance based on the Euclidean distance. To address the problem, this paper proposes to optimize the deep representation learning process with Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD). Specifically, with the restraint and relaxation iteration (RRI) training scheme, we are able to iteratively integrate the orthogonality constraint in CNN training, yielding the so-called SVDNet. We conduct experiments on the Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-reID datasets, and show that RRI effectively reduces the correlation among the projection vectors, produces more discriminative FC descriptors, and significantly improves the re-ID accuracy.

We first use segmentation to detect the objects of interest in 2D even in presence of partial occlusions and cluttered background. By contrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a \u201cholistic\u201d approach: We apply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to predict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3D bounding boxes. This, however, is not sufficient for handling objects from the recent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an axis of rotational symmetry, and the similarity of two images of such an object under two different poses makes training the CNN challenging. We solve this problem by restricting the range of poses used for training, and by introducing a classifier to identify the range of a pose at run-time before estimating it. We also use an optional additional step that refines the predicted poses. We improve the state-of-the-art on the LINEMOD dataset from 73.7% [2] to 89.3% of correctly registered RGB frames. We are also the first to report results on the Occlusion dataset [1] using color images only. We obtain 54% of frames passing the Pose 6D criterion on average on several sequences of the T-LESS dataset, compared to the 67% of the state-of-the-art [10] on the same sequences which uses both color and depth. The full approach is also scalable, as a single network can be trained for multiple objects simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.413","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237675.pdf","startPage":"3848","endPage":"3856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BB8: A Scalable, Accurate, Robust to Partial Occlusion Method for Predicting the 3D Poses of Challenging Objects without Using Depth","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"BB8: A Scalable, Accurate, Robust to Partial Occlusion Method for Predicting the 3D Poses of Challenging Objects without Using Depth","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237675/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467975","htmlLink":"/document/8237675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BB8: A Scalable, Accurate, Robust to Partial Occlusion Method for Predicting the 3D Poses of Challenging Objects without Using Depth","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063493S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237685,"authors":[{"name":"Renjie Wan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Renjie","lastName":"Wan","id":"37086156430"},{"name":"Boxin Shi","affiliation":["Artificial intelligence Research Center, National Institute of AIST, Japan"],"firstName":"Boxin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37401831700"},{"name":"Ling-Yu Duan","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, Peking University, China"],"firstName":"Ling-Yu","lastName":"Duan","id":"37404722600"},{"name":"Ah-Hwee Tan","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Ah-Hwee","lastName":"Tan"},{"name":"Alex C.

We formulate the process of finding the attentions of videos as a Markov decision process and train the attention model through a deep reinforcement learning framework without using extra labels. Unlike existing attention models, our method takes information from both the image space and the feature space as the input to make better use of face information that is discarded in the feature learning process. Besides, our approach is attention-aware, which seeks different attentions of videos for the recognition of different pairs of videos. Our approach achieves very competitive video face recognition performance on three widely used video face datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237686.pdf","startPage":"3951","endPage":"3960","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attention-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Video Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Face","Manifolds","Feature extraction","Machine learning","Markov processes","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov decision process","deep reinforcement learning framework","face information","feature learning process","attention-aware deep reinforcement learning method","face videos","person recognition","video face recognition","ADRL method","video face datasets","image space","feature space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Attention-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Video Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237686/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453250","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attention-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Video Face Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032d951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096403S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237687,"authors":[{"name":"Bugra Tekin","affiliation":["CVLab, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bugra","lastName":"Tekin","id":"37076972000"},{"name":"Pablo M\u00e1rquez-Neila","affiliation":["CVLab, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"M\u00e1rquez-Neila","id":"38276064100"},{"name":"Mathieu Salzmann","affiliation":["CVLab, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Salzmann","id":"37397917300"},{"name":"Pascal Fua","affiliation":["CVLab, EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fua","id":"37281288800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237687","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237687","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Streaming media","Pose estimation","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Fuses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","learning (artificial intelligence)","motion estimation","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","2D joint locations","3D joint coordinates","monocular 3D human","monocular body pose estimation","fuse 2D","standard 3D human","trainable fusion scheme"]}],"abstract":"Most recent approaches to monocular 3D human pose estimation rely on Deep Learning.

Learning pose-invariant features is one solution, but needs expensively labeled large-scale data and carefully designed feature learning algorithms. In this work, we focus on frontalizing faces in the wild under various head poses, including extreme profile view's. We propose a novel deep 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) conditioned Face Frontalization Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), termed as FF-GAN, to generate neutral head pose face images. Our framework differs from both traditional GANs and 3DMM based modeling. Incorporating 3DMM into the GAN structure provides shape and appearance priors for fast convergence with less training data, while also supporting end-to-end training. The 3DMM-conditioned GAN employs not only the discriminator and generator loss but also a new masked symmetry loss to retain visual quality under occlusions, besides an identity loss to recover high frequency information. Experiments on face recognition, landmark localization and 3D reconstruction consistently show the advantage of our frontalization method on faces in the wild datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Large-Pose Face Frontalization in the Wild","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.430","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237692.pdf","startPage":"4010","endPage":"4019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards Large-Pose Face Frontalization in the Wild","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237692/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467785","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Large-Pose Face Frontalization in the Wild","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115671S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237693,"authors":[{"name":"Bolun Cai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Bolun","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085364820"},{"name":"Xianming Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xianming","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086043249"},{"name":"Kailing Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Kailing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086121329"},{"name":"Kui Jia","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Jia","id":"37683115500"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Awareness and Intelligent Solutions Lab, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37307887900"},{"name":"Dacheng Tao","affiliation":["UBTECH Sydney AI Centre, The University of Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37269935500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237693","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Shape","Smoothing methods","Image color analysis","Linear programming","Estimation","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subjective assessments","objective assessments","illumination prior","reflectance estimation","luminous source","shape prior","structure information","local variation deviation","structure-preserving measure","Retinex models","2D image","joint intrinsic-extrinsic prior model","intrinsic properties","extrinsic property"]}],"abstract":"We propose a joint intrinsic-extrinsic prior model to estimate both illumination and reflectance from an observed image.

To detect and segment salient objects accurately, it is necessary to extract and combine high-level semantic features with low-levelfine details simultaneously. This happens to be a challenge for CNNs as repeated subsampling operations such as pooling and convolution lead to a significant decrease in the initial image resolution, which results in loss of spatial details and finer structures. To remedy this problem, here we propose to augment feedforward neural networks with a novel pyramid pooling module and a multi-stage refinement mechanism for saliency detection. First, our deep feedward net is used to generate a coarse prediction map with much detailed structures lost. Then, refinement nets are integrated with local context information to refine the preceding saliency maps generated in the master branch in a stagewise manner. Further, a pyramid pooling module is applied for different-region-based global context aggregation. Empirical evaluations over six benchmark datasets show that our proposed method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.433","startPage":"4039","endPage":"4048","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237695.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stagewise Refinement Model for Detecting Salient Objects in Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237695/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Stagewise Refinement Model for Detecting Salient Objects in Images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467936","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237695/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stagewise Refinement Model for Detecting Salient Objects in Images","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145177S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237697,"authors":[{"name":"Tae Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Empirical Inference, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems"],"firstName":"Tae Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085403692"},{"name":"Kyoung Mu Lee","affiliation":["Department of ECE, ASRI, Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Kyoung Mu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407638800"},{"name":"Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf","affiliation":["Department of Empirical Inference, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sch\u00f6lkopf","id":"37265889200"},{"name":"Michael Hirsch","affiliation":["Department of Empirical Inference, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hirsch","id":"37543623000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237697","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Dynamics","Streaming media","Kernel","Network architecture","Decoding","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image motion analysis","image restoration","image sequences","motion estimation","recurrent neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online video deblurring method","network layer","consecutive frames","dynamic temporal blending network","camera shake","temporal consistency","spatiotemporal recurrent network"]}],"abstract":"State-of-the-art video deblurring methods are capable of removing non-uniform blur caused by unwanted camera shake and/or object motion in dynamic scenes. However, most existing methods are based on batch processing and thus need access to all recorded frames, rendering them computationally demanding and time-consuming and thus limiting their practical use. In contrast, we propose an online (sequential) video deblurring method based on a spatio-temporal recurrent network that allows for realtime performance. In particular, we introduce a novel architecture which extends the receptive field while keeping the overall size of the network small to enable fast execution. In doing so, our network is able to remove even large blur caused by strong camera shake and/or fast moving objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel network layer that enforces temporal consistency between consecutive frames by dynamic temporal blending which compares and adaptively (at test time) shares features obtained at different time steps. We show the superiority of the proposed method in an extensive experimental evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.435","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"4058","endPage":"4067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Video Deblurring via Dynamic Temporal Blending Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online Video Deblurring via Dynamic Temporal Blending Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237697/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453074","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Video Deblurring via Dynamic Temporal Blending Network","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065375S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237702,"authors":[{"name":"Xinlei Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Xinlei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085669132"},{"name":"Abhinav Gupta","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37291130800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237702","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognition","Object detection","Context modeling","Proposals","Layout","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","inference mechanisms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","object recognition","spatial reasoning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial pattern extraction","object detectors","image representation","instance-level context modeling","object detection systems","conditional distribution modeling","context reasoning","non-maximal suppression","NMS","sequential reasoning architecture","object-object context reasoning","Spatial Memory Network","image-level memory cells","instance-level spatial reasoning","object-object relationships"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237702","abstract":"Modeling instance-level context and object-object relationships is extremely challenging. It requires reasoning about bounding boxes of different classes, locations etc. Above all, instance-level spatial reasoning inherently requires modeling conditional distributions on previous detections. Unfortunately, our current object detection systems do not have any memory to remember what to condition on! The state-of-the-art object detectors still detect all object in parallel followed by non-maximal suppression (NMS). While memory has been used for tasks such as captioning, they mostly use image-level memory cells without capturing the spatial layout. On the other hand, modeling object-object relationships requires spatial reasoning - not only do we need a memory to store the spatial layout, but also a effective reasoning module to extract spatial patterns. This paper presents a conceptually simple yet powerful solution - Spatial Memory Network (SMN), to model the instance-level context efficiently and effectively. Our spatial memory essentially assembles object instances back into a pseudo \u201cimage\u201d representation that is easy to be fed into another ConvNet for object-object context reasoning. This leads to a new sequential reasoning architecture where image and memory are processed in parallel to obtain detections which update the memory again. We show our SMN direction is promising as it provides 2.2% improvement over baseline Faster RCNN on the COCO dataset with VGG161.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.440","startPage":"4106","endPage":"4116","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Memory for Context Reasoning in Object Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237702/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatial Memory for Context Reasoning in Object Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237702/","accessionNumber":"17453245","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Memory for Context Reasoning in Object Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161718S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":8237706,"authors":[{"name":"Yousong Zhu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yousong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086278287"},{"name":"Chaoyang Zhao","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Chaoyang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086281875"},{"name":"Jinqiao Wang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Jinqiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406485400"},{"name":"Xu Zhao","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085634606"},{"name":"Yi Wu","affiliation":["School of Technology, Nanjing Audit University, Nanjing, China","Department of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086130681"},{"name":"Hanqing Lu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085501462"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237706","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Proposals","Feature extraction","Couplings","Visualization","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image classification","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CoupleNet","object detection","Convolutional Neural Network detectors","region proposal subnetwork","classification subnetwork","global structure information","position-sensitive score maps","novel fully convolutional network","Region Proposal Network","position-sensitive RoI pooling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237706","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237706.pdf","startPage":"4146","endPage":"4154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.444","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CoupleNet: Coupling Global Structure with Local Parts for Object Detection","abstract":"The region-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detectors such as Faster R-CNN or R-FCN have already shown promising results for object detection by combining the region proposal subnetwork and the classification subnetwork together. Although R-FCN has achieved higher detection speed while keeping the detection performance, the global structure information is ignored by the position-sensitive score maps. To fully explore the local and global properties, in this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network, named as CoupleNet, to couple the global structure with local parts for object detection. Specifically, the object proposals obtained by the Region Proposal Network (RPN) are fed into the the coupling module which consists of two branches. One branch adopts the position-sensitive RoI (PSRoI) pooling to capture the local part information of the object, while the other employs the RoI pooling to encode the global and context information. Next, we design different coupling strategies and normalization ways to make full use of the complementary advantages between the global and local branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results on all three challenging datasets, i.e. a mAP of 82.7% on VOC07, 80.4% on VOC12, and 34.4% on COCO.

In addition, most of prior work mainly focus on counting objects in static environments with fixed cameras. Motivated by the advent of unmanned flying vehicles (i.e., drones), we are interested in detecting and counting objects in such dynamic environments. We propose Layout Proposal Networks (LPNs) and spatial kernels to simultaneously count and localize target objects (e.g., cars) in videos recorded by the drone. Different from the conventional region proposal methods, we leverage the spatial layout information (e.g., cars often park regularly) and introduce these spatially regularized constraints into our network to improve the localization accuracy. To evaluate our counting method, we present a new large-scale car parking lot dataset (CARPK) that contains nearly 90,000 cars captured from different parking lots. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first and the largest drone view dataset that supports object counting, and provides the bounding box annotations.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.446","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237708.pdf","startPage":"4165","endPage":"4173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drone-Based Object Counting by Spatially Regularized Regional Proposal Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237708/","displayDocTitle":"Drone-Based Object Counting by Spatially Regularized Regional Proposal Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453006","htmlLink":"/document/8237708/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drone-Based Object Counting by Spatially Regularized Regional Proposal Network","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092275S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8237710,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiyu Li","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Ruiyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085669976"},{"name":"Makarand Tapaswi","affiliation":["University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Makarand","lastName":"Tapaswi","id":"37660375500"},{"name":"Renjie Liao","affiliation":["University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Renjie","lastName":"Liao","id":"37086272063"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["Youtu Lab, Tencent","The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"},{"name":"Raquel Urtasun","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","Vector Institute","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Raquel","lastName":"Urtasun","id":"37269502900"},{"name":"Sanja Fidler","affiliation":["Vector Institute","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Sanja","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37689726500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237710","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Semantics","Visualization","Image edge detection","Tools","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image motion analysis","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["situation recognition","Graph Neural Networks","semantic roles","graph connectivities","most salient verb prediction","action source","action target"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237710","abstract":"We address the problem of recognizing situations in images.

However, few works study whether the human-designed semantic attributes are discriminative enough to recognize different classes. Moreover, attributes are often correlated with each other, which makes it less desirable to learn each attribute independently. In this paper, we propose to learn a latent attribute space, which is not only discriminative but also semantic-preserving, to perform the ZSL task. Specifically, a dictionary learning framework is exploited to connect the latent attribute space with attribute space and similarity space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237715.pdf","startPage":"4233","endPage":"4242","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Discriminative Latent Attributes for Zero-Shot Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Dictionaries","Machine learning","Visualization","Gold","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionary learning framework","ZSL task","human-designed semantic attributes","great popularity","common semantic space","zero-shot learning","zero-shot classification","discriminative latent attributes","latent attribute space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Discriminative Latent Attributes for Zero-Shot Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237715/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467821","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Discriminative Latent Attributes for Zero-Shot Classification","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080646S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237728,"authors":[{"name":"Feihu Zhang","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Feihu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085335182"},{"name":"Benjamin W.

However, learning in traditional neural networks (NNs) only tries to find a model with fixed parameters that optimize the average behavior over all inputs, without using data-specific properties. In this paper, we develop a meta-level NN (MLNN) model that learns meta-knowledge on data-specific properties of images during learning and that dynamically adapts its weights during application according to the properties of the images input. MLNN consists of two parts: the dynamic supplementary NN (SNN) that learns meta-information on each type of inputs, and the fixed base-level NN (BLNN) that incorporates the meta-information from SNN into its weights at run time to realize the generalization for each type of inputs. We verify our approach using over ten network architectures under various application scenarios and loss functions. In low-level vision applications on image super-resolution and demising, MLNN has 0.1~0.3 dB improvements on PSNR, whereas for high-level image classification, MLNN has accuracy improvement of 0.4~0.6% for Cifar10 and 1.2~2.1% for ImageNet when compared to convolutional NNs (CNNs). Improvements are more pronounced as the scale or diversity of data is increased.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237728.pdf","startPage":"4354","endPage":"4363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supplementary Meta-Learning: Towards a Dynamic Model for Deep Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.466","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Supplementary Meta-Learning: Towards a Dynamic Model for Deep Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453053","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237728/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supplementary Meta-Learning: Towards a Dynamic Model for Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080028S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237729,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Yu Fish Tung","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, US"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Yu Fish","lastName":"Tung"},{"name":"Adam W.

Learning such mappings from unlabelled data, or improving upon supervised models by exploiting unlabelled data, remains elusive. We argue that there are two important parts to learning without annotations: (i) matching the predictions to the input observations, and (ii) matching the predictions to known priors. We propose Adversarial Inverse Graphics networks (AIGNs): weakly supervised neural network models that combine feedback from rendering their predictions, with distribution matching between their predictions and a collection of ground-truth factors. We apply AIGNs to 3D human pose estimation and 3D structure and egomotion estimation, and outperform models supervised by only paired annotations. We further apply AIGNs to facial image transformation using super-resolution and inpainting renderers, while deliberately adding biases in the ground-truth datasets. Our model seamlessly incorporates such biases, rendering input faces towards young, old, feminine, masculine or Tom Cruiselike equivalents (depending on the chosen bias), or adding lip and nose augmentations while inpainting concealed lips and noses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237729/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237729/","accessionNumber":"17453199","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial Inverse Graphics Networks: Learning 2D-to-3D Lifting and Image-to-Image Translation from Unpaired Supervision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial Inverse Graphics Networks: Learning 2D-to-3D Lifting and Image-to-Image Translation from Unpaired Supervision","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093781S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237731,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Zhang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086279120"},{"name":"Guo-Jun Qi","affiliation":["University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Guo-Jun","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085376043"},{"name":"Bin Xiao","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086273308"},{"name":"Jingdong Wang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research"],"firstName":"Jingdong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086278583"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237731","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Computational complexity","Tensile stress","Redundancy","Network architecture","Computer architecture","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","filtering theory","group theory","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["named interleaved group convolutional neural networks","successive interleaved group convolutions","primary group convolution","secondary group convolution","spatial convolution","point-wise convolution","different primary partitions","regular convolution","modularized neural network architecture","simple network architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237731","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237731.pdf","startPage":"4383","endPage":"4392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.469","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interleaved Group Convolutions","abstract":"In this paper, we present a simple and modularized neural network architecture, named interleaved group convolutional neural networks (IGCNets).

We discuss one representative advantage: Wider than a regular convolution with the number of parameters and the computation complexity preserved. We also show that regular convolutions, group convolution with summation fusion, and the Xception block are special cases of interleaved group convolutions.

In this paper, we leverage the temporal continuity of videos instead of operating at the frame level.

The same way state-of-the-art object detectors rely on anchor boxes, our ACT-detector is based on anchor cuboids. We build upon the SSD framework [19]. Convolutional features are extracted for each frame, while scores and regressions are based on the temporal stacking of these features, thus exploiting information from a sequence. Our experimental results show that leveraging sequences offrantes significantly improves detection performance over using individual frames. The gain of our tubelet detector can be explained by both more accurate scores and more precise localization.

With this paper we radically depart from current practice, and take a first step towards the design and implementation of a deep network architecture able to classify and regress whole video subsets, so providing a truly optimal solution of the action detection problem. In this work, in particular, we propose a novel deep net framework able to regress and classify 3D region proposals spanning two successive video frames, whose core is an evolution of classical region proposal networks (RPNs). As such, our 3D-RPN net is able to effectively encode the temporal aspect of actions by purely exploiting appearance, as opposed to methods which heavily rely on expensive flow maps. The proposed model is end-to-end trainable and can be jointly optimised for action localisation and classification in a single step. At test time the network predicts `micro-tubes' encompassing two successive frames, which are linked up into complete action tubes via a new algorithm which exploits the temporal encoding learned by the network and cuts computation time by 50%. Promising results on the J-HMDB-21 and UCF-101 action detection datasets show that our model does outperform the state-of-the-art when relying purely on appearance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.473","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237735.pdf","startPage":"4424","endPage":"4433","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMTnet: Action-Micro-Tube Regression by End-to-end Trainable Deep Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"AMTnet: Action-Micro-Tube Regression by End-to-end Trainable Deep Architecture","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237735/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467850","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237735/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMTnet: Action-Micro-Tube Regression by End-to-end Trainable Deep Architecture","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11458S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8237737,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Wilkinson","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Wilkinson","id":"37086091251"},{"name":"Jonas Lindstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Department of History, Uppsala University"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Lindstr\u00f6m","id":"37086336570"},{"name":"Anders Brun","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Brun","id":"38548284400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237737","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Text recognition","Image segmentation","Information technology","History","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","document image processing","handwritten character recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","text analysis","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten word spotting","distributed word embedding space","manuscript page","Ctrl-F-Net","deep neural networks","end-to-end trainable model","historical handwritten texts","digitized manuscripts","machine learning","computer vision","handwritten documents","handwritten manuscript collections","segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting","neural Ctrl-F"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we approach the problem of segmentation-free query-by-string word spotting for handwritten documents. In other words, we use methods inspired from computer vision and machine learning to search for words in large collections of digitized manuscripts. In particular, we are interested in historical handwritten texts, which are often far more challenging than modern printed documents. This task is important, as it provides people with a way to quickly find what they are looking for in large collections that are tedious and difficult to read manually. To this end, we introduce an end-to-end trainable model based on deep neural networks that we call Ctrl-F-Net. Given a full manuscript page, the model simultaneously generates region proposals, and embeds these into a distributed word embedding space, where searches are performed. We evaluate the model on common benchmarks for handwritten word spotting, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art segmentation-free approaches by a large margin, and in some cases even segmentation-based approaches. One interesting real-life application of our approach is to help historians to find and count specific words in court records that are related to women's sustenance activities and division of labor. We provide promising preliminary experiments that validate our method on this task.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.475","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237737.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"4443","endPage":"4452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Ctrl-F: Segmentation-Free Query-by-String Word Spotting in Handwritten Manuscript Collections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural Ctrl-F: Segmentation-Free Query-by-String Word Spotting in Handwritten Manuscript Collections","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237737/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452959","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Ctrl-F: Segmentation-Free Query-by-String Word Spotting in Handwritten Manuscript Collections","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079186S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237739,"authors":[{"name":"Raghudeep Gadde","affiliation":["Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience"],"firstName":"Raghudeep","lastName":"Gadde","id":"37085405075"},{"name":"Varun Jampani","affiliation":["MPI for Intelligent Systems","NVIDIA"],"firstName":"Varun","lastName":"Jampani","id":"37085415670"},{"name":"Peter V.

This problem is challenging because video appearance and motion can be highly complex. Traditional optical-flow-based solutions often fail where flow estimation is challenging, while newer neural-network-based methods that hallucinate pixel values directly often produce blurry results. We combine the advantages of these two methods by training a deep network that learns to synthesize video frames by flowing pixel values from existing ones, which we call deep voxel flow. Our method requires no human supervision, and any video can be used as training data by dropping, and then learning to predict, existing frames. The technique is efficient, and can be applied at any video resolution. We demonstrate that our method produces results that both quantitatively and qualitatively improve upon the state-of-the-art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237740/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453100","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Video Frame Synthesis Using Deep Voxel Flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Frame Synthesis Using Deep Voxel Flow","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127969S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237741,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Tao","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Tao","id":"37085664157"},{"name":"Hongyun Gao","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hongyun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086265703"},{"name":"Renjie Liao","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Renjie","lastName":"Liao","id":"37086272063"},{"name":"Jue Wang","affiliation":["Megvii Inc."],"firstName":"Jue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086263218"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["Youtu Lab, Tencent","The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237741","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":116,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":482},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Image resolution","Motion estimation","Optical imaging","Fuses","Optical variables control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","motion compensation","neural nets","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proper frame alignment","sub-pixel motion compensation layer","video SR","scalable CNN framework","SPMC layer","detail-revealing deep video super-resolution","CNN-based video super-resolution approaches","multiple frame alignment","multiple frame fusion"]}],"abstract":"Previous CNN-based video super-resolution approaches need to align multiple frames to the reference.

The visual memory is implemented with convolutional gated recurrent units, which allows to propagate spatial information over time.

Traditionally, the performance of algorithms for this task is measured using pixel-wise reconstruction measures such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which have been shown to correlate poorly with the human perception of image quality. As a result, algorithms minimizing these metrics tend to produce over-smoothed images that lack highfrequency textures and do not look natural despite yielding high PSNR values.,,We propose a novel application of automated texture synthesis in combination with a perceptual loss focusing on creating realistic textures rather than optimizing for a pixelaccurate reproduction of ground truth images during training. By using feed-forward fully convolutional neural networks in an adversarial training setting, we achieve a significant boost in image quality at high magnification ratios. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets show the effectiveness of our approach, yielding state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.481","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237743.pdf","startPage":"4501","endPage":"4510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EnhanceNet: Single Image Super-Resolution Through Automated Texture Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"EnhanceNet: Single Image Super-Resolution Through Automated Texture Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237743/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467752","htmlLink":"/document/8237743/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EnhanceNet: Single Image Super-Resolution Through Automated Texture Synthesis","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107819S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237745,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Nguyen","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Vu","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086309247"},{"name":"Tomas F.

Previous methods for shadow detection focus on learning the local appearance of shadow regions, while using limited local context reasoning in the form of pairwise potentials in a Conditional Random Field. In contrast, the proposed adversarial approach is able to model higher level relationships and global scene characteristics. We train a shadow detector that corresponds to the generator of a conditional GAN, and augment its shadow accuracy by combining the typical GAN loss with a data loss term. Due to the unbalanced distribution of the shadow labels, we use weighted cross entropy. With the standard GAN architecture, properly setting the weight for the cross entropy would require training multiple GANs, a computationally expensive grid procedure. In scGAN, we introduce an additional sensitivity parameter w to the generator. The proposed approach effectively parameterizes the loss of the trained detector. The resulting shadow detector is a single network that can generate shadow maps corresponding to different sensitivity levels, obviating the need for multiple models and a costly training procedure. We evaluate our method on the large-scale SBU and UCF shadow datasets, and observe up to 17% error reduction with respect to the previous state-of-the-art method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453298","htmlLink":"/document/8237745/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Shadow Detection with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shadow Detection with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086959S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8237746,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsong Zhang","affiliation":["Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085437703"},{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lalonde","affiliation":["Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Lalonde","id":"37282914800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237746","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","Lighting","Sun","Cameras","Rendering (computer graphics)","Three-dimensional displays","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image capture","image reconstruction","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDR omnidirectional camera","lighting capture","outdoor light capture","low dynamic range panoramas","high dynamic range data","deep autoencoder framework","learning-based inverse tonemapping method","outdoor environment maps","outdoor lighting","outdoor panoramas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237746","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237746.pdf","startPage":"4529","endPage":"4538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning High Dynamic Range from Outdoor Panoramas","abstract":"Outdoor lighting has extremely high dynamic range.

However, as the depth grows, the longterm dependency problem is rarely realized for these very deep models, which results in the prior states/layers having little influence on the subsequent ones. Motivated by the fact that human thoughts have persistency, we propose a very deep persistent memory network (MemNet) that introduces a memory block, consisting of a recursive unit and a gate unit, to explicitly mine persistent memory through an adaptive learning process. The recursive unit learns multi-level representations of the current state under different receptive fields. The representations and the outputs from the previous memory blocks are concatenated and sent to the gate unit, which adaptively controls how much of the previous states should be reserved, and decides how much of the current state should be stored. We apply MemNet to three image restoration tasks, i.e., image denosing, super-resolution and JPEG deblocking. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the necessity of the MemNet and its unanimous superiority on all three tasks over the state of the arts.

Several widely-used measures such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), Average Precision (AP) and the recently proposed F W/B (Fbw) have been used to evaluate the similarity between a non-binary saliency map (SM) and a ground-truth (GT) map. These measures are based on pixel-wise errors and often ignore the structural similarities. Behavioral vision studies, however, have shown that the human visual system is highly sensitive to structures in scenes. Here, we propose a novel, efficient, and easy to calculate measure known as structural similarity measure (Structure-measure) to evaluate non-binary foreground maps. Our new measure simultaneously evaluates region-aware and object-aware structural similarity between a SM and a GT map.

In this paper, we propose a pioneering unified framework that solves four problems simultaneously, namely, dense depth reconstruction, camera pose estimation, super-resolution, and deblurring. By reflecting a physical imaging process, we formulate a cost minimization problem and solve it using an alternating optimization technique. The experimental results on both synthetic and real videos show high-quality depth maps derived from severely degraded images that contrast the failures of naive multi-view stereo methods.

We then use the 3D information to orient, place, and score bounding boxes around objects. We independently estimate the orientation for every object, using previous techniques that utilize normal information. Object locations and sizes in 3D are learned using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In the final step, we refine our detections based on object class relations within a scene. When compared to state-of-the-art detection methods that operate almost entirely in the sparse 3D domain, extensive experiments on the well-known SUN RGB-D dataset [29] show that our proposed method is much faster (4.1s per image) in detecting 3D objects in RGB-D images and performs better (3 mAP higher) than the state-of-the-art method that is 4.7 times slower and comparably to the method that is two orders of magnitude slower.

Current multi-exposure fusion (MEF) approaches use hand-crafted features to fuse input sequence. However, the weak hand-crafted representations are not robust to varying input conditions.

Thus, it is highly desirable to have a method that is robust to varying input conditions and capable of handling extreme exposure without artifacts. Deep representations have known to be robust to input conditions and have shown phenomenal performance in a supervised setting. However, the stumbling block in using deep learning for MEF was the lack of sufficient training data and an oracle to provide the ground-truth for supervision. To address the above issues, we have gathered a large dataset of multi-exposure image stacks for training and to circumvent the need for ground truth images, we propose an unsupervised deep learning framework for MEF utilizing a no-reference quality metric as loss function. The proposed approach uses a novel CNN architecture trained to learn the fusion operation without reference ground truth image. The model fuses a set of common low level features extracted from each image to generate artifact-free perceptually pleasing results. We perform extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for a variety of natural images.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.505","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237767.pdf","startPage":"4724","endPage":"4732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeepFuse: A Deep Unsupervised Approach for Exposure Fusion with Extreme Exposure Image Pairs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DeepFuse: A Deep Unsupervised Approach for Exposure Fusion with Extreme Exposure Image Pairs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237767/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453259","htmlLink":"/document/8237767/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepFuse: A Deep Unsupervised Approach for Exposure Fusion with Extreme Exposure Image Pairs","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e724.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072605S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237769,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangjie Xu","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Shuangjie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086328852"},{"name":"Yu Cheng","affiliation":["AI Foundations, IBM Research"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086227396"},{"name":"Kang Gu","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Gu","id":"37086329858"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

Their architectures have largely drawn inspiration by models of the primate visual system. However, while recent research results of neuroscience prove the existence of non-linear operations in the response of complex visual cells, little effort has been devoted to extend the convolution technique to non-linear forms. Typical convolutional layers are linear systems, hence their expressiveness is limited. To overcome this, various non-linearities have been used as activation functions inside CNNs, while also many pooling strategies have been applied. We address the issue of developing a convolution method in the context of a computational model of the visual cortex, exploring quadratic forms through the Volterra kernels. Such forms, constituting a more rich function space, are used as approximations of the response profile of visual cells. Our proposed second-order convolution is tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that a network which combines linear and non-linear filters in its convolutional layers, can outperform networks that use standard linear filters with the same architecture, yielding results competitive with the state-of-the-art on these datasets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Visualization","Kernel","Brain modeling","Computer architecture","Computational

Despite significant research, it remains unclear to what extent human fixations can be predicted by low-level (contrast) compared to highlevel (presence of objects) image features. Here we address this problem by introducing two novel models that use different feature spaces but the same readout architecture. The first model predicts human fixations based on deep neural network features trained on object recognition. This model sets a new state-of-the art in fixation prediction by achieving top performance in area under the curve metrics on the MIT300 hold-out benchmark (AUC = 88%, sAUC = 77%, NSS = 2.34). The second model uses purely low-level (isotropic contrast) features. This model achieves better performance than all models not using features pretrained on object recognition, making it a strong baseline to assess the utility of high-level features. We then evaluate and visualize which fixations are better explained by lowlevel compared to high-level image features. Surprisingly we find that a substantial proportion of fixations are better explained by the simple low-level model than the stateof- the-art model. Comparing different features within the same powerful readout architecture allows us to better understand the relevance of low- versus high-level features in predicting fixation locations, while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art saliency prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237775.pdf","startPage":"4799","endPage":"4808","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Low- and High-Level Contributions to Fixation Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Computational modeling","Object recognition","Measurement","Computer architecture","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image classification","neural nets","object detection","object recognition","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level features","fixation locations","high-level contributions","fixation prediction","computer vision","object recognition","low-level features","isotropic contrast","high-level image features","simple low-level model","saliency prediction","feature spaces","deep neural network","low-level contributions","human fixations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Low- and High-Level Contributions to Fixation Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237775/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453101","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Low- and High-Level Contributions to Fixation Prediction","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14499S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8237776,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Tong","affiliation":["Imperial Vision Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Tong","id":"37390990300"},{"name":"Gen Li","affiliation":["Imperial Vision Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086299386"},{"name":"Xiejie Liu","affiliation":["Imperial Vision Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiejie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086305389"},{"name":"Qinquan Gao","affiliation":["Imperial Vision Technology, Fuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qinquan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086301181"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237776","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":236,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1482},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Deconvolution","Convolution","Image resolution","Interpolation","Computational modeling","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense skip connections","single-image super-resolution methods","deep convolutional neural networks","deep network","feature maps","low-level features","high-level features","reconstruction performance","deconvolution layers","single-image super-resolution method"]}],"abstract":"Recent studies have shown that the performance of single-image super-resolution methods can be significantly boosted by using deep convolutional neural networks. In this study, we present a novel single-image super-resolution method by introducing dense skip connections in a very deep network. In the proposed network, the feature maps of each layer are propagated into all subsequent layers, providing an effective way to combine the low-level features and high-level features to boost the reconstruction performance. In addition, the dense skip connections in the network enable short paths to be built directly from the output to each layer, alleviating the vanishing-gradient problem of very deep networks. Moreover, deconvolution layers are integrated into the network to learn the upsampling filters and to speedup the reconstruction process. Further, the proposed method substantially reduces the number of parameters, enhancing the computational efficiency. We evaluate the proposed method using images from four benchmark datasets and set a new state of the art.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.514","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237776.pdf","startPage":"4809","endPage":"4817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Super-Resolution Using Dense Skip Connections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Image Super-Resolution Using Dense Skip Connections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237776/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453256","htmlLink":"/document/8237776/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Super-Resolution Using Dense Skip Connections","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08168S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"236","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237779,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Galteri","affiliation":["MICC, University of Florence"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Galteri","id":"37086110823"},{"name":"Lorenzo Seidenari","affiliation":["MICC, University of Florence"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Seidenari","id":"37393644800"},{"name":"Marco Bertini","affiliation":["MICC, University of Florence"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Bertini","id":"37267334200"},{"name":"Alberto Del Bimbo","affiliation":["MICC, University of Florence"],"firstName":"Alberto Del","lastName":"Bimbo","id":"37326231100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237779","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Image resolution","Gallium nitride","Discrete cosine transforms","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","data compression","image coding","mean square error methods","object detection","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mean Squared Error","image compression artifacts","GAN","Structural Similarity optimization","residual network model","disturbed version","object detectors","computer vision algorithms","human eye","lossy compression algorithm","deep generative adversarial compression artifact removal","SSIM trained networks","SSIM based networks","photorealistic details","MSE","generative adversarial framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237779","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237779.pdf","startPage":"4836","endPage":"4845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.517","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Generative Adversarial Compression Artifact Removal","abstract":"Compression artifacts arise in images whenever a lossy compression algorithm is applied. These artifacts eliminate details present in the original image, or add noise and small structures; because of these effects they make images less pleasant for the human eye, and may also lead to decreased performance of computer vision algorithms such as object detectors. To eliminate such artifacts, when decompressing an image, it is required to recover the original image from a disturbed version. To this end, we present a feed-forward fully convolutional residual network model trained using a generative adversarial framework. To provide a baseline, we show that our model can be also trained optimizing the Structural Similarity (SSIM), which is a better loss with respect to the simpler Mean Squared Error (MSE). Our GAN is able to produce images with more photorealistic details than MSE or SSIM based networks. Moreover we show that our approach can be used as a pre-processing step for object detection in case images are degraded by compression to a point that state-of-the art detectors fail. In this task, our GAN method obtains better performance than MSE or SSIM trained networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237779/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17453127","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237779/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep Generative Adversarial Compression Artifact Removal","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Generative Adversarial Compression Artifact Removal","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130701S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237780,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Chu","id":"37086280668"},{"name":"Wanli Ouyang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","University of Sydney"],"firstName":"Wanli","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37392356500"},{"name":"Hongsheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hongsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37067578200"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085438971"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085563184"},{"name":"Nenghai Yu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Nenghai","lastName":"Yu","id":"37394112700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237780","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":673},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Object tracking","Training","Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","image motion analysis","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","object tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online multiobject tracking","single object tracker","spatial-temporal attention mechanism","online MOT","appearance model","computational efficiency","occlusion","target-specific CNN layers","visibility map","spatial attention map","STAM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a CNN-based framework for online MOT. This framework utilizes the merits of single object trackers in adapting appearance models and searching for target in the next frame. Simply applying single object tracker for MOT will encounter the problem in computational efficiency and drifted results caused by occlusion. Our framework achieves computational efficiency by sharing features and using ROI-Pooling to obtain individual features for each target. Some online learned target-specific CNN layers are used for adapting the appearance model for each target. In the framework, we introduce spatial-temporal attention mechanism (STAM) to handle the drift caused by occlusion and interaction among targets. The visibility map of the target is learned and used for inferring the spatial attention map. The spatial attention map is then applied to weight the features. Besides, the occlusion status can be estimated from the visibility map, which controls the online updating process via weighted loss on training samples with different occlusion statuses in different frames. It can be considered as temporal attention mechanism. The proposed algorithm achieves 34.3% and 46.0% in MOTA on challenging MOT15 and MOT16 benchmark dataset respectively.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237780.pdf","startPage":"4846","endPage":"4855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Multi-object Tracking Using CNN-Based Single Object Tracker with Spatial-Temporal Attention Mechanism","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Online Multi-object Tracking Using CNN-Based Single Object Tracker with Spatial-Temporal Attention Mechanism","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452957","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237780/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Multi-object Tracking Using CNN-Based Single Object Tracker with Spatial-Temporal Attention Mechanism","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096698S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237784,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Najibi","affiliation":["University of Maryland"],"firstName":"Mahyar","lastName":"Najibi","id":"37085684515"},{"name":"Pouya Samangouei","affiliation":["University of Maryland"],"firstName":"Pouya","lastName":"Samangouei","id":"37085699594"},{"name":"Rama Chellappa","affiliation":["University of Maryland"],"firstName":"Rama","lastName":"Chellappa","id":"37274537000"},{"name":"Larry S.

Unlike two stage proposal-classification detectors, SSH detects faces in a single stage directly from the early convolutional layers in a classification network. SSH is headless. That is, it is able to achieve state-of-the-art results while removing the \u201chead\u201d of its underlying classification network - i.e. all fully connected layers in the VGG-16 which contains a large number of parameters. Additionally, instead of relying on an image pyramid to detect faces with various scales, SSH is scale-invariant by design. We simultaneously detect faces with different scales in a single forward pass of the network, but from different layers. These properties make SSH fast and light-weight. Surprisingly, with a headless VGG-16, SSH beats the ResNet-101-based state-of-the-art on the WIDER dataset. Even though, unlike the current state-of-the-art, SSH does not use an image pyramid and is 5X faster. Moreover, if an image pyramid is deployed, our light-weight network achieves state-of-the-art on all subsets of the WIDER dataset, improving the AP by 2.5%. SSH also reaches state-of-the-art results on the FDDB and Pascal-Faces datasets while using a small input size, leading to a speed of 50 frames/second on a GPU.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.522","startPage":"4885","endPage":"4894","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237784.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SSH: Single Stage Headless Face Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237784/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SSH: Single Stage Headless Face Detector","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237784/","accessionNumber":"17467941","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SSH: Single Stage Headless Face Detector","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118254S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":8237786,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Yao","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Yao","id":"38548222400"},{"name":"Yingwei Pan","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yingwei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085662646"},{"name":"Yehao Li","affiliation":["Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yehao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086218917"},{"name":"Zhaofan Qiu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhaofan","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086213052"},{"name":"Tao Mei","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Mei","id":"37894131700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237786","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Image representation","Hidden Markov models","Semantics","Detectors","Neural networks","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Short-Term Memory","Multiple Instance Learning","image representations","COCO image captioning dataset","natural language processing","RNN","Convolutional Neural Networks","Recurrent Neural Networks","CNN","computer vision"]}],"abstract":"Automatically describing an image with a natural language has been an emerging challenge in both fields of computer vision and natural language processing.

Recent research shows that the combination of Fisher vector (FV) encoding and convolutional neural network (CNN) provides significant improvement in texture classification over the previous feature representation methods. However, by truncating the CNN model at the last convolutional layer, the CNN-based FV descriptors would not incorporate the full capability of neural networks in feature learning. In this study, we propose that we can further transform the CNN-based FV descriptors in a neural network model to obtain more discriminative feature representations. In particular, we design a locally-transferred Fisher vector (LFV) method, which involves a multi-layer neural network model containing locally connected layers to transform the input FV descriptors with filters of locally shared weights.

It involves clicking on imaginary comers of a tight box around the object. This is difficult as these comers are often outside the actual object and several adjustments are required to obtain a tight box. We propose extreme clicking instead: we ask the annotator to click on four physical points on the object: the top, bottom, left- and right-most points. This task is more natural and these points are easy to find. We crowd-source extreme point annotations for PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and show that (1) annotation time is only 7s per box, 5 \u00d7 faster than the traditional way of drawing boxes [62]: (2) the quality of the boxes is as good as the original ground-truth drawn the traditional way: (3) detectors trained on our annotations are as accurate as those trained on the original ground-truth. Moreover, our extreme clicking strategy not only yields box coordinates, but also four accurate boundary points. We show (4) how to incorporate them into GrabCut to obtain more accurate segmentations than those delivered when initializing it from bounding boxes: (5) semantic segmentations models trained on these segmentations outperform those trained on segmentations derived from bounding boxes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.528","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237790.pdf","startPage":"4940","endPage":"4949","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme Clicking for Efficient Object Annotation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Extreme Clicking for Efficient Object Annotation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237790/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453146","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237790/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extreme Clicking for Efficient Object Annotation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e940.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117744S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":8237791,"authors":[{"name":"Han Hu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086147888"},{"name":"Chengquan Zhang","affiliation":["IDL, Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Chengquan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086292939"},{"name":"Yuxuan Luo","affiliation":["IDL, Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Yuxuan","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086143840"},{"name":"Yuzhuo Wang","affiliation":["IDL, Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Yuzhuo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086295157"},{"name":"Junyu Han","affiliation":["IDL, Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Junyu","lastName":"Han","id":"37086142613"},{"name":"Errui Ding","affiliation":["IDL, Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Errui","lastName":"Ding","id":"37086146980"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237791","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237791","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Detectors","Pipelines","Visualization","Computational modeling","Engines","Text recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","feature extraction","text analysis","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["math expression recognition","text detection engine","text detection benchmarks","rich large-scale real scene text datasets","robust character detector","character detector training","word annotations","location annotated characters","training character detectors","mathematical expression","Japanese expression","Chinese expression","text blocks","text lines","imagery texts","character based text detection"]}],"abstract":"Imagery texts are usually organized as a hierarchy of several visual elements, i.e. characters, words, text lines and text blocks. Among these elements, character is the most basic one for various languages such as Western, Chinese, Japanese, mathematical expression and etc. It is natural and convenient to construct a common text detection engine based on character detectors. However, training character detectors requires a vast of location annotated characters, which are expensive to obtain. Actually, the existing real text datasets are mostly annotated in word or line level. To remedy this dilemma, we propose a weakly supervised framework that can utilize word annotations, either in tight quadrangles or the more loose bounding boxes, for character detector training. When applied in scene text detection, we are thus able to train a robust character detector by exploiting word annotations in the rich large-scale real scene text datasets, e.g. ICDAR15 [19] and COCO-text [39]. The character detector acts as a key role in the pipeline of our text detection engine. It achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several challenging scene text detection benchmarks. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our pipeline by various scenarios, including deformed text detection and math expression recognition.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.529","startPage":"4950","endPage":"4959","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237791.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WordSup: Exploiting Word Annotations for Character Based Text Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237791/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"WordSup: Exploiting Word Annotations for Character Based Text Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467944","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WordSup: Exploiting Word Annotations for Character Based Text Detection","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126726S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237792,"authors":[{"name":"Garrick Brazil","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Garrick","lastName":"Brazil","id":"37086294431"},{"name":"Xi Yin","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085547874"},{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37076098000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237792","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Semantics","Object detection","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image segmentation","object detection","pedestrians","road safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmentation supervision","Caltech pedestrian dataset","illuminating pedestrians","computer vision","pedestrian detection accuracy","segmentation infusion network","semantic segmentation","additional supervision","urban autonomous driving safety"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237792","abstract":"Pedestrian detection is a critical problem in computer vision with significant impact on safety in urban autonomous driving. In this work, we explore how semantic segmentation can be used to boost pedestrian detection accuracy while having little to no impact on network efficiency. We propose a segmentation infusion network to enable joint supervision on semantic segmentation and pedestrian detection. When placed properly, the additional supervision helps guide features in shared layers to become more sophisticated and helpful for the downstream pedestrian detector. Using this approach, we find weakly annotated boxes to be sufficient for considerable performance gains. We provide an in-depth analysis to demonstrate how shared layers are shaped by the segmentation supervision. In doing so, we show that the resulting feature maps become more semantically meaningful and robust to shape and occlusion. Overall, our simultaneous detection and segmentation framework achieves a considerable gain over the state-of-the-art on the Caltech pedestrian dataset, competitive performance on KITTI, and executes 2 \u00d7 faster than competitive methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.530","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237792.pdf","startPage":"4960","endPage":"4969","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illuminating Pedestrians via Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Illuminating Pedestrians via Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453188","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237792/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illuminating Pedestrians via Simultaneous Detection and Segmentation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061147S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":8237794,"authors":[{"name":"Jawadul H.

The recent success of the deep learning approaches in different recognition tasks inspires us to develop a high confidence detection framework which can localize manipulated regions in an image. Unlike semantic object segmentation where all meaningful regions (objects) are segmented, the localization of image manipulation focuses only the possible tampered region which makes the problem even more challenging. In order to formulate the framework, we employ a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to capture discriminative features between manipulated and non-manipulated regions. One of the key properties of manipulated regions is that they exhibit discriminative features in boundaries shared with neighboring non-manipulated pixels. Our motivation is to learn the boundary discrepancy, i.e., the spatial structure, between manipulated and non-manipulated regions with the combination of LSTM and convolution layers. We perform end-to-end training of the network to learn the parameters through back-propagation given ground-truth mask information. The overall framework is capable of detecting different types of image manipulations, including copy-move, removal and splicing. Our model shows promising results in localizing manipulated regions, which is demonstrated through rigorous experimentation on three diverse datasets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Spatial Structure for Localizing Manipulated Image Regions","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.532","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237794.pdf","startPage":"4980","endPage":"4989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Spatial Structure for Localizing Manipulated Image Regions","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237794/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467965","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Spatial Structure for Localizing Manipulated Image Regions","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136783S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237795,"authors":[{"name":"Seungyong Lee","affiliation":["POSTECH"],"firstName":"Seungyong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086072087"},{"name":"Seong-Jin Park","affiliation":["POSTECH"],"firstName":"Seong-Jin","lastName":"Park","id":"37086271485"},{"name":"Ki-Sang Hong","affiliation":["POSTECH"],"firstName":"Ki-Sang","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086074489"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237795","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"abstract":"In multi-class indoor semantic segmentation using RGB-D data, it has been shown that incorporating depth feature into RGB feature is helpful to improve segmentation accuracy. However, previous studies have not fully exploited the potentials of multi-modal feature fusion, e.g., simply concatenating RGB and depth features or averaging RGB and depth score maps. To learn the optimal fusion of multimodal features, this paper presents a novel network that extends the core idea of residual learning to RGB-D semantic segmentation. Our network effectively captures multilevel RGB-D CNN features by including multi-modal feature fusion blocks and multi-level feature refinement blocks. Feature fusion blocks learn residual RGB and depth features and their combinations to fully exploit the complementary characteristics of RGB and depth data. Feature refinement blocks learn the combination of fused features from multiple levels to enable high-resolution prediction. Our network can efficiently train discriminative multi-level features from each modality end-to-end by taking full advantage of skip-connections. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on two challenging RGB-D indoor datasets, NYUDv2 and SUN RGB-D.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237795.pdf","startPage":"4990","endPage":"4999","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RDFNet: RGB-D Multi-level Residual Feature Fusion for Indoor Semantic Segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Fuses","Convolution","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image colour analysis","image fusion","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth score maps","optimal fusion","multimodal features","residual learning","RGB-D semantic segmentation","multilevel RGB-D CNN features","multilevel feature refinement blocks","depth features","depth data","multilevel features","modality end-to-end","SUN RGB-D","RGB-D multilevel","residual feature fusion","multiclass indoor semantic segmentation","RGB-D data","RGB feature","multimodal feature fusion blocks","RGB-D indoor datasets","SUN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"RDFNet: RGB-D Multi-level Residual Feature Fusion for Indoor Semantic Segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237795/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467963","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RDFNet: RGB-D Multi-level Residual Feature Fusion for Indoor Semantic Segmentation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032e990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105615S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8237796,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Neuhold","affiliation":["Mapillary Research"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Neuhold","id":"37086238927"},{"name":"Tobias Ollmann","affiliation":["Mapillary Research"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Ollmann","id":"37086312607"},{"name":"Samuel Rota Bul\u00f2","affiliation":["Mapillary Research"],"firstName":"Samuel Rota","lastName":"Bul\u00f2","id":"37391883700"},{"name":"Peter Kontschieder","affiliation":["Mapillary Research"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kontschieder","id":"38193452500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237796","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1049},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Cameras","Image segmentation","Visualization","Protocols","Quality assurance","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","data visualisation","image annotation","image resolution","image segmentation","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mapillary Vistas Dataset","large-scale street-level image dataset","semantic image segmentation","instance-specific image segmentation","visual road-scene understanding","image resolution","street scene understanding","image annotation"]}],"abstract":"The Mapillary Vistas Dataset is a novel, large-scale street-level image dataset containing 25000 high-resolution images annotated into 66 object categories with additional, instance-specific labels for 37 classes.

As default benchmark tasks, we define semantic image segmentation and instance-specific image segmentation, aiming to significantly further the development of state-of-the-art methods for visual road-scene understanding.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.534","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237796.pdf","startPage":"5000","endPage":"5009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Mapillary Vistas Dataset for Semantic Understanding of Street Scenes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Mapillary Vistas Dataset for Semantic Understanding of Street Scenes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237796/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453303","htmlLink":"/document/8237796/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Mapillary Vistas Dataset for Semantic Understanding of Street Scenes","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136224S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237801,"authors":[{"name":"Adam W.

This counter-acts the tendency of CNNs to smooth information across regions and increases their spatial precision. To obtain segmentation information, we set up a CNN to provide an embedding space where region co-membership can be estimated based on Euclidean distance. We use these embeddings to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron position. We incorporate such masks in CNNs and replace the convolution operation with a \u201csegmentation-aware\u201d variant that allows a neuron to selectively attend to inputs coming from its own region. We call the resulting network a segmentation-aware CNN because it adapts its filters at each image point according to local segmentation cues, while at the same time remaining fully-convolutional. We demonstrate the merit of our method on two widely different dense prediction tasks, that involve classification (semantic segmentation) and regression (optical flow). Our results show that in semantic segmentation we can replace DenseCRF inference with a cascade of segmentation-aware filters, and in optical flow we obtain clearly sharper responses than the ones obtained with comparable networks that do not use segmentation. In both cases segmentation-aware convolution yields systematic improvements over strong baselines.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237801","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Image segmentation","Neurons","Semantics","Optical filters","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","filtering theory","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmentation-aware convolutional networks","local attention mask","segmentation information","convolutional neural network","CNN","neuron position","convolution operation","segmentation-aware variant","resulting network","local segmentation cues","widely different dense prediction tasks","semantic segmentation","optical flow","segmentation-aware filters","comparable networks","cases segmentation-aware convolution yields systematic improvements"]}],"publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237801.pdf","startPage":"5048","endPage":"5057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.539","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation-Aware Convolutional Networks Using Local Attention Masks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237801/","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation-Aware Convolutional Networks Using Local Attention Masks","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467964","htmlLink":"/document/8237801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation-Aware Convolutional Networks Using Local Attention Masks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141968S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237802,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Marcos","affiliation":["University of Zurich"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Marcos","id":"37085905897"},{"name":"Michele Volpi","affiliation":["University of Zurich"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Volpi","id":"37586980300"},{"name":"Nikos Komodakis","affiliation":["Ecole des Ponts, Paris Tech"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Komodakis","id":"37281808800"},{"name":"Devis Tuia","affiliation":["University of Zurich"],"firstName":"Devis","lastName":"Tuia","id":"37395181300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237802","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Automobiles","Training","Encoding","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","convolution","filtering theory","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotation equivariant vector field networks","convolutional neural network architecture encoding rotation equivariance","RotEqNet","convolutional filter","computer vision tasks"]}],"abstract":"In many computer vision tasks, we expect a particular behavior of the output with respect to rotations of the input image.

In this paper, we propose the Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks (RotEqNet), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture encoding rotation equivariance, invariance and covariance. Each convolutional filter is applied at multiple orientations and returns a vector field representing magnitude and angle of the highest scoring orientation at every spatial location. We develop a modified convolution operator relying on this representation to obtain deep architectures. We test RotEqNet on several problems requiring different responses with respect to the inputs' rotation: image classification, biomedical image segmentation, orientation estimation and patch matching. In all cases, we show that RotEqNet offers extremely compact models in terms of number of parameters and provides results in line to those of networks orders of magnitude larger.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.540","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237802.pdf","startPage":"5058","endPage":"5067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237802/","displayDocTitle":"Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467874","htmlLink":"/document/8237802/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107316S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237803,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Hao Luo","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Hao","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086195480"},{"name":"Jianxin Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404821400"},{"name":"Weiyao Lin","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weiyao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085611243"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237803","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":297,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":764},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Training","Acceleration","Libraries","Optimization","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image filtering","inference mechanisms","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ThiNet","AlexNet level accuracy","filter level pruning method","deep learning libraries","VGG-16 model","CNN models","optimization problem","ILSVRC-12 benchmark","inference stages","deep neural network compression"]}],"abstract":"We propose an efficient and unified framework, namely ThiNet, to simultaneously accelerate and compress CNN models in both training and inference stages. We focus on the filter level pruning, i.e., the whole filter would be discarded if it is less important. Our method does not change the original network structure, thus it can be perfectly supported by any off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. We formally establish filter pruning as an optimization problem, and reveal that we need to prune filters based on statistics information computed from its next layer, not the current layer, which differentiates ThiNet from existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, which has advanced the state-of-the-art. We also show the performance of ThiNet on ILSVRC-12 benchmark. ThiNet achieves 3.31 x FLOPs reduction and 16.63\u00d7 compression on VGG-16, with only 0.52% top-5 accuracy drop. Similar experiments with ResNet-50 reveal that even for a compact network, ThiNet can also reduce more than half of the parameters and FLOPs, at the cost of roughly 1% top-5 accuracy drop.

The state of the art is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns the mapping between input images and output sequences in a purely data-driven way. However, we observe that existing attention-based methods perform poorly on complicated and/or low-quality images. One major reason is that existing methods cannot get accurate alignments between feature areas and targets for such images. We call this phenomenon \u201cattention drift\u201d. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose the FAN (the abbreviation of Focusing Attention Network) method that employs a focusing attention mechanism to automatically draw back the drifted attention. FAN consists of two major components: an attention network (AN) that is responsible for recognizing character targets as in the existing methods, and a focusing network (FN) that is responsible for adjusting attention by evaluating whether AN pays attention properly on the target areas in the images. Furthermore, different from the existing methods, we adopt a ResNet-based network to enrich deep representations of scene text images. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR datasets, show that the FAN method substantially outperforms the existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.543","startPage":"5086","endPage":"5094","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237805.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focusing Attention: Towards Accurate Text Recognition in Natural Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Focusing Attention: Towards Accurate Text Recognition in Natural Images","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237805/","accessionNumber":"17467893","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237805/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Focusing Attention: Towards Accurate Text Recognition in Natural Images","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08412S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-03"},{"_id":8237808,"authors":[{"name":"Siddhartha Chandra","affiliation":["INRIA GALEN, CentraleSup\u00e9lec"],"firstName":"Siddhartha","lastName":"Chandra","id":"37085608878"},{"name":"Nicolas Usunier","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research, Paris"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Usunier","id":"37992809100"},{"name":"Iasonas Kokkinos","affiliation":["Facebook AI Research, Paris"],"firstName":"Iasonas","lastName":"Kokkinos","id":"37330875100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237808","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Mathematical model","Linear systems","Semantics","Sparse matrices","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Gaussian processes","gradient methods","graph theory","image capture","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unary terms","pairwise terms","analytic expressions","Potts-type variants","pixel-to-pixel affinities","Deep embeddings","structured prediction model","computational complexity","pairwise interactions","low-dimensional embeddings","learnable embeddings","G-CRF system matrix","conjugate gradient","dense Gaussian CRFs","Deep Gaussian Conditional Random Field","gradient methods","connected graph structure"]}],"abstract":"In this work we introduce a structured prediction model that endows the Deep Gaussian Conditional Random Field (G-CRF) with a densely connected graph structure.

This paper focuses on cross-camera label estimation, which can be subsequently used in feature learning to learn robust re-ID models. Specifically, we propose to construct a graph for samples in each camera, and then graph matching scheme is introduced for cross-camera labeling association. While labels directly output from existing graph matching methods may be noisy and inaccurate due to significant cross-camera variations, this paper propose a dynamic graph matching (DGM) method. DGM iteratively updates the image graph and the label estimation process by learning a better feature space with intermediate estimated labels. DGM is advantageous in two aspects: 1) the accuracy of estimated labels is improved significantly with the iterations; 2) DGM is robust to noisy initial training data. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks including the large-scale MARS dataset show that DGM yields competitive performance to fully supervised baselines, and outperforms competing unsupervised learning methods.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237812.pdf","startPage":"5152","endPage":"5160","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Label Graph Matching for Unsupervised Video Re-identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Estimation","Noise measurement","Robustness","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","image matching","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","unsupervised learning","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy initial training data","DGM yields competitive performance","unsupervised learning methods","dynamic label graph matching","Unsupervised Video Re-identification","unsupervised person re-identification","cross-camera label estimation","robust re-ID models","graph matching scheme","cross-camera labeling association","graph matching methods","significant cross-camera variations","dynamic graph matching method","image graph","label estimation process","feature space","Re"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Label Graph Matching for Unsupervised Video Re-identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237812/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467854","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Label Graph Matching for Unsupervised Video Re-identification","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091928S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237813,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37086313009"},{"name":"Xingjian Shi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Xingjian","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086315097"},{"name":"Dit-Yan Yeung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Dit-Yan","lastName":"Yeung","id":"37270592100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237813","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"abstract":"Region of Interest (ROI) crowd counting can be formulated as a regression problem of learning a mapping from an image or a video frame to a crowd density map. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) models have achieved promising results for crowd counting. However, even when dealing with video data, CNN-based methods still consider each video frame independently, ignoring the strong temporal correlation between neighboring frames. To exploit the otherwise very useful temporal information in video sequences, we propose a variant of a recent deep learning model called convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for crowd counting. Unlike the previous CNN-based methods, our method fully captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we extend the ConvLSTM model to a bidirectional ConvLSTM model which can access long-range information in both directions. Extensive experiments using four publicly available datasets demonstrate the reliability of our approach and the effectiveness of incorporating temporal information to boost the accuracy of crowd counting. In addition, we also conduct some transfer learning experiments to show that once our model is trained on one dataset, its learning experience can be transferred easily to a new dataset which consists of only very few video frames for model adaptation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237813.pdf","startPage":"5161","endPage":"5169","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Modeling for Crowd Counting in Videos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Computational modeling","Correlation","Video sequences","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","regression analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowd counting","CNN","temporal correlation","model adaptation","bidirectional ConvLSTM model","recent deep learning model","video sequences","video data","convolutional neural network models","crowd density map","video frame","videos","spatiotemporal modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Modeling for Crowd Counting in Videos","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237813/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452991","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Modeling for Crowd Counting in Videos","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11113S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237818,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojuan Qi","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Xiaojuan","lastName":"Qi"},{"name":"Renjie Liao","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Renjie","lastName":"Liao","id":"37086272063"},{"name":"Jiaya Jia","affiliation":["Youtu Lab Tencent","The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiaya","lastName":"Jia","id":"37275642500"},{"name":"Sanja Fidler","affiliation":["University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Sanja","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37689726500"},{"name":"Raquel Urtasun","affiliation":["Uber Advanced Technologies Group","University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Raquel","lastName":"Urtasun","id":"37269502900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237818","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Neural networks","Semantics","Feature extraction","Image segmentation","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","graph theory","image classification","image representation","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D graph neural network","3DGNN","k-nearest neighbor graph","3D point cloud","hidden representation vector","per-node representation","semantic class","RGBD semantic segmentation","3D geometric information"]}],"abstract":"RGBD semantic segmentation requires joint reasoning about 2D appearance and 3D geometric information.

Existing approaches predominantly solve these challenges independently, while neglecting the fact that part localization (e.g., head of a bird) and fine-grained feature learning (e.g., head shape) are mutually correlated. In this paper, we propose a novel part learning approach by a multi-attention convolutional neural network (MA-CNN), where part generation and feature learning can reinforce each other. MA-CNN consists of convolution, channel grouping and part classification sub-networks. The channel grouping network takes as input feature channels from convolutional layers, and generates multiple parts by clustering, weighting and pooling from spatially-correlated channels. The part classification network further classifies an image by each individual part, through which more discriminative fine-grained features can be learned. Two losses are proposed to guide the multi-task learning of channel grouping and part classification, which encourages MA-CNN to generate more discriminative parts from feature channels and learn better fine-grained features from parts in a mutual reinforced way. MA-CNN does not need bounding box/part annotation and can be trained end-to-end. We incorporate the learned parts from MA-CNN with part-CNN for recognition, and show the best performances on three challenging published fine-grained datasets, e.g., CUB-Birds, FGVC-Aircraft and Stanford-Cars.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.557","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237819.pdf","startPage":"5219","endPage":"5227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Multi-attention Convolutional Neural Network for Fine-Grained Image Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Multi-attention Convolutional Neural Network for Fine-Grained Image Recognition","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237819/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453144","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237819/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Multi-attention Convolutional Neural Network for Fine-Grained Image Recognition","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097697S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237820,"authors":[{"name":"David Novotny","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group Naver Labs Europe","Visual Geometry Group Dept. of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Novotny","id":"37085616744"},{"name":"Diane Larlus","affiliation":["Computer Vision Group Naver Labs Europe"],"firstName":"Diane","lastName":"Larlus","id":"37860201700"},{"name":"Andrea Vedaldi","affiliation":["Visual Geometry Group Dept. of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Vedaldi","id":"37398040100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237820","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Videos","Solid modeling","Geometry","Video sequences","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","image motion analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","probability","solid modelling","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry-aware data augmentation schemes","video alignment","3D object category learning","3D shape completion network","object shape extraction","3D geometry","Siamese viewpoint factorization network","moving vantage point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237820","abstract":"Traditional approaches for learning 3D object categories use either synthetic data or manual supervision.

The whole framework can be trained end-to-end, requiring only images, ground-truth bounding boxes and text labels.

This is important because the output of many computer vision tasks, including image tagging and object detection, are naturally expressed as sets of entities rather than vectors. As opposed to a vector, the size of a set is not fixed in advance, and it is invariant to the ordering of entities within it. We define a likelihood for a set distribution and learn its parameters using a deep neural network. We also derive a loss for predicting a discrete distribution corresponding to set cardinality. Set prediction is demonstrated on the problem of multi-class image classification. Moreover, we show that the proposed cardinality loss can also trivially be applied to the tasks of object counting and pedestrian detection. Our approach outperforms existing methods in all three cases on standard datasets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability density function","Machine learning","Random variables","Radio frequency","Computer vision","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclass image classification","deep neural network","deep learning","computer vision tasks","image tagging","object detection","set distribution","set cardinality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237823","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.561","startPage":"5257","endPage":"5266","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237823.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237823/","displayDocTitle":"DeepSetNet: Predicting Sets with Deep Neural Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467979","htmlLink":"/document/8237823/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeepSetNet: Predicting Sets with Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143577S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237837,"authors":[{"name":"Ancong Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Ancong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085747981"},{"name":"Wei-Shi Zheng","affiliation":["NUDT, Collaborative Innovation Center of High Performance Computing, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Machine Intelligence and Advanced Computing, China","School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Shi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37399449200"},{"name":"Hong-Xing Yu","affiliation":["School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Xing","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086286121"},{"name":"Shaogang Gong","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shaogang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269431700"},{"name":"Jianhuang Lai","affiliation":["Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Information Security, China","School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, China"],"firstName":"Jianhuang","lastName":"Lai","id":"37274695700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237837","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":885},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Probes","Image color analysis","Training","Feature extraction","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","image classification","image colour analysis","image matching","infrared imaging","neural nets","pedestrians"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pedestrian images","camera views","infrared imaging","visual systems","person Re-ID","challenging cross-modality problem","RGB-IR cross-modality Re-ID problem","RGB-IR cross-modality matching","visual characteristics","RGB images","RGB-infrared cross-modality person Re-identification","video surveillance","multiple modality Re-ID dataset","neural network structures","deep zero-padding","domain-specific nodes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237837","abstract":"Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important problem in video surveillance, aiming to match pedestrian images across camera views. Currently, most works focus on RGB-based Re-ID. However, in some applications, RGB images are not suitable, e.g. in a dark environment or at night. Infrared (IR) imaging becomes necessary in many visual systems. To that end, matching RGB images with infrared images is required, which are heterogeneous with very different visual characteristics. For person Re-ID, this is a very challenging cross-modality problem that has not been studied so far. In this work, we address the RGB-IR cross-modality Re-ID problem and contribute a new multiple modality Re-ID dataset named SYSU-MM01, including RGB and IR images of 491 identities from 6 cameras, giving in total 287,628 RGB images and 15,792 IR images. To explore the RGB-IR Re-ID problem, we evaluate existing popular cross-domain models, including three commonly used neural network structures (one-stream, two-stream and asymmetric FC layer) and analyse the relation between them. We further propose deep zero-padding for training one-stream network towards automatically evolving domain-specific nodes in the network for cross-modality matching. Our experiments show that RGB-IR cross-modality matching is very challenging but still feasible using the proposed model with deep zero-padding, giving the best performance.

It is a challenging problem because many people captured in surveillance videos wear similar clothes.

Existing re-id models, particularly the recently proposed deep learning based ones match people at a single scale. In contrast, in this paper, a novel multi-scale deep learning model is proposed. Our model is able to learn deep discriminative feature representations at different scales and automatically determine the most suitable scales for matching. The importance of different spatial locations for extracting discriminative features is also learned explicitly.

Many large scale face datasets exhibit long-tail distribution where a small number of entities (persons) have large number of face images while a large number of persons only have very few face samples (long tail). Most of the existing works alleviate this problem by simply cutting the tailed data and only keep identities with enough number of examples. Unlike these work, this paper investigated how long-tailed data impact the training of face CNNs and develop a novel loss function, called range loss, to effectively utilize the tailed data in training process. More specifically, range loss is designed to reduce overall intrapersonal variations while enlarge interpersonal differences simultaneously. Extensive experiments on two face recognition benchmarks, Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) [11] and YouTube Faces (YTF) [33], demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed range loss in overcoming the long tail effect, and show the good generalization ability of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.578","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237840.pdf","startPage":"5419","endPage":"5428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range Loss for Deep Face Recognition with Long-Tailed Training Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237840/","displayDocTitle":"Range Loss for Deep Face Recognition with Long-Tailed Training Data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453213","htmlLink":"/document/8237840/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range Loss for Deep Face Recognition with Long-Tailed Training Data","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117588S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237843,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Dahl","affiliation":["Google Brain"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Dahl","id":"37086312358"},{"name":"Mohammad Norouzi","affiliation":["Google Brain"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Norouzi","id":"37400665500"},{"name":"Jonathon Shlens","affiliation":["Google Brain"],"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Shlens","id":"37086118500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237843","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Predictive models","Probabilistic logic","Training","Buildings","Signal resolution","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low resolution photograph","plausible high resolution version","high magnification factors","given low resolution image","particular resolution techniques","traditional super resolution techniques","image synthesis","plausible high resolution images","pixel recursive super resolution model"]}],"abstract":"Super resolution is the problem of artificially enlarging a low resolution photograph to recover a plausible high resolution version. In the regime of high magnification factors, the problem is dramatically underspecified and many plausible, high resolution images may match a given low resolution image. In particular, traditional super resolution techniques fail in this regime due to the multimodality of the problem and strong prior information that must be imposed on image synthesis to produce plausible high resolution images. In this work we propose a new probabilistic deep network architecture, a pixel recursive super resolution model, that is an extension of PixelCNNs to address this problem. We demonstrate that this model produces a diversity of plausible high resolution images at large magnification factors. Furthermore, in human evaluation studies we demonstrate how previous methods fail to fool human observers. However, high resolution images sampled from this probabilistic deep network do fool a naive human observer a significant fraction of the time.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.581","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"5449","endPage":"5458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixel Recursive Super Resolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pixel Recursive Super Resolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237843/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467918","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237843/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixel Recursive Super Resolution","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f449.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087946S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237846,"authors":[{"name":"Yousef Atoum","affiliation":["Michigan State University"],"firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Atoum","id":"37085345692"},{"name":"Joseph Roth","affiliation":["Michigan State University"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Roth","id":"37075920800"},{"name":"Michael Bliss","affiliation":["General Motors"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bliss","id":"37086264433"},{"name":"Wende Zhang","affiliation":["General Motors"],"firstName":"Wende","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291405500"},{"name":"Xiaoming Liu","affiliation":["Michigan State University"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37076098000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237846","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplers","Three-dimensional displays","Cameras","Two dimensional displays","Multiplexing","Estimation","Radar tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer vision","convolution","intelligent transportation systems","neural nets","object detection","road vehicles","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monocular video","trailer coupler detection","automated monocular-camera","computer vision system","vehicle control system","trailers coupler","Multiplexer-CNN method","CNN detector","presence confidence score","2D target detection","trailer database","estimation error","multiplexer convolutional neural network","autonomous self-backing-up","tow hitch alignment","coupler-to-vehicle distance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237846","abstract":"This paper presents an automated monocular-camera-based computer vision system for autonomous self-backing-up a vehicle towards a trailer, by continuously estimating the 3D trailer coupler position and feeding it to the vehicle control system, until the alignment of the tow hitch with the trailers coupler.

Our PTAV framework typically consists of two components, a tracker T and a verifier V, working in parallel on two separate threads. The tracker T aims to provide a super real-time tracking inference and is expected to perform well most of the time; by contrast, the verifier V checks the tracking results and corrects T when needed. The key innovation is that, V does not work on every frame but only upon the requests from T; on the other end, T may adjust the tracking according to the feedback from V. With such collaboration, PTAV enjoys both the high efficiency provided by T and the strong discriminative power by V. In our extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including OTB2013, OTB2015, TC128 and UAV20L, PTAV achieves the best tracking accuracy among all real-time trackers, and in fact performs even better than many deep learning based solutions. Moreover, as a general framework, PTAV is very flexible and has great rooms for improvement and generalization.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.585","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237847.pdf","startPage":"5487","endPage":"5495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Tracking and Verifying: A Framework for Real-Time and High Accuracy Visual Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Tracking and Verifying: A Framework for Real-Time and High Accuracy Visual Tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237847/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453258","htmlLink":"/document/8237847/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Tracking and Verifying: A Framework for Real-Time and High Accuracy Visual Tracking","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.186083S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237851,"authors":[{"name":"Huseyin Coskun","affiliation":["Technischc Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"],"firstName":"Huseyin","lastName":"Coskun","id":"37086126454"},{"name":"Felix Achilles","affiliation":["Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Achilles","id":"37085799690"},{"name":"Robert DiPietro","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"DiPietro","id":"37086304397"},{"name":"Nassir Navab","affiliation":["Technischc Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen","Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Nassir","lastName":"Navab","id":"37282965500"},{"name":"Federico Tombari","affiliation":["Technischc Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Tombari","id":"37593332100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237851","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237851","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Noise measurement","Pose estimation","Data models","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image filtering","image motion analysis","image representation","Kalman filters","pose estimation","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long short-term memory Kalman filters","recurrent neural estimators","pose regularization","Kalman filter","motion model","constant velocity","dynamic representations","noise models","One-shot pose estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.589","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237851.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","startPage":"5525","endPage":"5533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long Short-Term Memory Kalman Filters: Recurrent Neural Estimators for Pose Regularization","abstract":"One-shot pose estimation for tasks such as body joint localization, camera pose estimation, and object tracking are generally noisy, and temporal filters have been extensively used for regularization. One of the most widely-used methods is the Kalman filter, which is both extremely simple and general. However, Kalman filters require a motion model and measurement model to be specified a priori, which burdens the modeler and simultaneously demands that we use explicit models that are often only crude approximations of reality. For example, in the pose-estimation tasks mentioned above, it is common to use motion models that assume constant velocity or constant acceleration, and we believe that these simplified representations are severely inhibitive. In this work, we propose to instead learn rich, dynamic representations of the motion and noise models. In particular, we propose learning these models from data using long shortterm memory, which allows representations that depend on all previous observations and all previous states. We evaluate our method using three of the most popular pose estimation tasks in computer vision, and in all cases we obtain state-of-the-art performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237851/","accessionNumber":"17453028","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237851/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Long Short-Term Memory Kalman Filters: Recurrent Neural Estimators for Pose Regularization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long Short-Term Memory Kalman Filters: Recurrent Neural Estimators for Pose Regularization","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131221S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8237852,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaofan Qiu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhaofan","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086213052"},{"name":"Ting Yao","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Yao","id":"38548222400"},{"name":"Tao Mei","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Mei","id":"37085828375"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237852","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":226,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1060},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Visualization","Kernel","Solid modeling","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","image classification","image recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","spatiotemporal phenomena","stereo image processing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pseudo3D Residual Networks","Convolutional Neural Networks","image recognition problems","spatial dimensions","temporal dimensions","off-the-shelf 2D networks","residual learning framework","1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional filters","temporal connections","P3D ResNet","Sports-1M video classification dataset","3D CNN","spatio-temporal representation learning","spatio-temporal video representation learning","3D convolutions","3 x 3 x 3 convolutions","Pseudo3D Residual Net","frame-based 2D CNN","adjacent feature maps"]}],"abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been regarded as a powerful class of models for image recognition problems. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when utilizing a CNN for learning spatio-temporal video representation. A few studies have shown that performing 3D convolutions is a rewarding approach to capture both spatial and temporal dimensions in videos. However, the development of a very deep 3D CNN from scratch results in expensive computational cost and memory demand. A valid question is why not recycle off-the-shelf 2D networks for a 3D CNN. In this paper, we devise multiple variants of bottleneck building blocks in a residual learning framework by simulating 3 x 3 x 3 convolutions with 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 convolutional filters on spatial domain (equivalent to 2D CNN) plus 3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 convolutions to construct temporal connections on adjacent feature maps in time. Furthermore, we propose a new architecture, named Pseudo-3D Residual Net (P3D ResNet), that exploits all the variants of blocks but composes each in different placement of ResNet, following the philosophy that enhancing structural diversity with going deep could improve the power of neural networks. Our P3D ResNet achieves clear improvements on Sports-1M video classification dataset against 3D CNN and frame-based 2D CNN by 5.3% and 1.8%, respectively. We further examine the generalization performance of video representation produced by our pre-trained P3D ResNet on five different benchmarks and three different tasks, demonstrating superior performances over several state-of-the-art techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.590","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237852.pdf","startPage":"5534","endPage":"5542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Spatio-Temporal Representation with Pseudo-3D Residual Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning Spatio-Temporal Representation with Pseudo-3D Residual Networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237852/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Spatio-Temporal Representation with Pseudo-3D Residual Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082893S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237853,"authors":[{"name":"Da Li","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Da","lastName":"Li","id":"37086309440"},{"name":"Yongxin Yang","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085614840"},{"name":"Yi-Zhe Song","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Yi-Zhe","lastName":"Song","id":"37600648900"},{"name":"Timothy M.

Domain generalization (DG) has a clear motivation in contexts where there are target domains with distinct characteristics, yet sparse data for training. For example recognition in sketch images, which are distinctly more abstract and rarer than photos. Nevertheless, DG methods have primarily been evaluated on photo-only benchmarks focusing on alleviating the dataset bias where both problems of domain distinctiveness and data sparsity can be minimal. We argue that these benchmarks are overly straightforward, and show that simple deep learning baselines perform surprisingly well on them. In this paper, we make two main contributions: Firstly, we build upon the favorable domain shift-robust properties of deep learning methods, and develop a low-rank parameterized CNN model for end-to-end DG learning. Secondly, we develop a DG benchmark dataset covering photo, sketch, cartoon and painting domains. This is both more practically relevant, and harder (bigger domain shift) than existing benchmarks. The results show that our method outperforms existing DG alternatives, and our dataset provides a more significant DG challenge to drive future research.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.591","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237853.pdf","startPage":"5543","endPage":"5551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deeper, Broader and Artier Domain Generalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237853/","displayDocTitle":"Deeper, Broader and Artier Domain Generalization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467817","htmlLink":"/document/8237853/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deeper, Broader and Artier Domain Generalization","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093897S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":8237854,"authors":[{"name":"Jifei Song","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Jifei","lastName":"Song","id":"37086292690"},{"name":"Qian Yu","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086067407"},{"name":"Yi-Zhe Song","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Yi-Zhe","lastName":"Song","id":"37600648900"},{"name":"Tao Xiang","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37398590900"},{"name":"Timothy M.

Fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) importantly leverages on such fine-grained characteristics of sketches to conduct instance-level retrieval of photos. Nevertheless, human sketches are often highly abstract and iconic, resulting in severe misalignments with candidate photos which in turn make subtle visual detail matching difficult. Existing FG-SBIR approaches focus only on coarse holistic matching via deep cross-domain representation learning, yet ignore explicitly accounting for fine-grained details and their spatial context. In this paper, a novel deep FG-SBIR model is proposed which differs significantly from the existing models in that: (1) It is spatially aware, achieved by introducing an attention module that is sensitive to the spatial position of visual details: (2) It combines coarse and fine semantic information via a shortcut connection fusion block: and (3) It models feature correlation and is robust to misalignments between the extracted features across the two domains by introducing a novel higher-order learnable energy function (HOLEF) based loss.

First, it sorts all detection boxes on the basis of their scores. The detection box M with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a significant overlap (using a pre-defined threshold) with M are suppressed. This process is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the algorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leads to a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-NMS, an algorithm which decays the detection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap with M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-NMS obtains consistent improvements for the coco-style mAP metric on standard datasets like PASCAL VOC2007 (1.7% for both R-FCN and Faster-RCNN) and MS-COCO (1.3% for R-FCN and 1.1% for Faster-RCNN) by just changing the NMS algorithm without any additional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-RFCN, Soft-NMS improves state-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8% to 40.9% with a single model. Further, the computational complexity of Soft-NMS is the same as traditional NMS and hence it can be efficiently implemented. Since Soft-NMS does not require any extra training and is simple to implement, it can be easily integrated into any object detection pipeline.

The predictive feature learning is carried out in two predictive tasks: frame prediction and predictive parsing. It is experimentally proved that the learned predictive features in our model are able to significantly enhance the video parsing performance by combining with the standard image parsing network. Interestingly, the performance gain brought by the predictive learning is almost costless as the features are learned from a large amount of unlabeled video data in an unsupervised way. Extensive experiments over two challenging datasets, Cityscapes and Camvid, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model by showing remarkable improvement over well-established baselines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Scene Parsing with Predictive Feature Learning","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.595","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237857.pdf","startPage":"5581","endPage":"5589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Video Scene Parsing with Predictive Feature Learning","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237857/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453218","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Scene Parsing with Predictive Feature Learning","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107236S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237860,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangjie Cao","affiliation":["KLiss, MOE; NEL-BDS; TNList, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Zhangjie","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086323688"},{"name":"Mingsheng Long","affiliation":["KLiss, MOE; NEL-BDS; TNList, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Mingsheng","lastName":"Long","id":"38003407600"},{"name":"Jianmin Wang","affiliation":["KLiss, MOE; NEL-BDS; TNList, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37076153400"},{"name":"Philip S.

Deep learning to hash, which improves retrieval quality by end-to-end representation learning and hash encoding, has received increasing attention recently. Subject to the ill-posed gradient difficulty in the optimization with sign activations, existing deep learning to hash methods need to first learn continuous representations and then generate binary hash codes in a separated binarization step, which suffer from substantial loss of retrieval quality. This work presents HashNet, a novel deep architecture for deep learning to hash by continuation method with convergence guarantees, which learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data. The key idea is to attack the ill-posed gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with non-smooth binary activations by continuation method, in which we begin from learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve during the training, until it eventually goes back to being the original, difficult to optimize, deep network with the sign activation function. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that HashNet can generate exactly binary hash codes and yield state-of-the-art multimedia retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453157","htmlLink":"/document/8237860/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HashNet: Deep Learning to Hash by Continuation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HashNet: Deep Learning to Hash by Continuation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107177S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237861,"authors":[{"name":"Edouard Oyallon","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement Informatique, ENS/PSL Research University, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Edouard","lastName":"Oyallon","id":"37085632558"},{"name":"Eugene Belilovsky","affiliation":["KU Leuven and INRIA University of Paris-Saclay"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Belilovsky","id":"37681020400"},{"name":"Sergey Zagoruyko","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Ecole des Ponts ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Zagoruyko","id":"37085692147"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237861","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Pipelines","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image coding","neural nets","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervised hybrid deep network","Deep CNNs","shallow cascade","scattering coefficients","imagenet ILSVRC2012","local encoding","scattering network","Resnet-18 architecture","scattering transform","Deep hybrid networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.599","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237861.pdf","startPage":"5619","endPage":"5628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling the Scattering Transform: Deep Hybrid Networks","abstract":"We use the scattering network as a generic and fixed initialization of the first layers of a supervised hybrid deep network.

We propose a paradigm shift and design a structured prediction model in the space of functional maps, linear operators that provide a compact representation of the correspondence. We model the learning process via a deep residual network which takes dense descriptor fields defined on two shapes as input, and outputs a soft map between the two given objects.

Most existing approaches utilize hand-crafted features for each modality independently and combine them in a heuristic manner. They often fail to consider the consistency and complementary information among features adequately, which makes them difficult to capture high-level semantic structures. The features learned by most of the current deep learning methods can obtain high-quality image classification results. However, these methods are hard to be applied to recognize 3D point clouds due to unorganized distribution and various point density of data. In this paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural network (RNN)for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds. In our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize and segment the points of the object's class efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual RNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye window, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point clouds. Our method provides an automatic process that maps the raw data to the classification results. It also integrates object localization, segmentation and classification into one framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud classification methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453289","htmlLink":"/document/8237867/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"3DCNN-DQN-RNN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale 3D Point Clouds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3DCNN-DQN-RNN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale 3D Point Clouds","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086456S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237868,"authors":[{"name":"Nasim Souly","affiliation":["Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Nasim","lastName":"Souly","id":"37086124340"},{"name":"Concetto Spampinato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering, University of Catania"],"firstName":"Concetto","lastName":"Spampinato","id":"37547440100"},{"name":"Mubarak Shah","affiliation":["Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida"],"firstName":"Mubarak","lastName":"Shah","id":"37275509600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237868","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1578},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237868","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Semantics","Image segmentation","Generators","Visualization","Semisupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","semantic networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pixel classification","semantic segmentation methods","Semi supervised semantic segmentation","generated images","multiclass pixel classification","GAN framework","multiclass classifier","generator network","semisupervised framework","Generative Adversarial Networks","weakly labeled data","pixel-level annotated data","image pixel","generative adversarial network","class level information","weakly annotated data","GANs"]}],"abstract":"Semantic segmentation has been a long standing challenging task in computer vision. It aims at assigning a label to each image pixel and needs a significant number of pixel-level annotated data, which is often unavailable. To address this lack of annotations, in this paper, we leverage, on one hand, a massive amount of available unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and on the other hand, non-real images created through Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we propose a semi-supervised framework - based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) - which consists of a generator network to provide extra training examples to a multi-class classifier, acting as discriminator in the GAN framework, that assigns sample a label y from the K possible classes or marks it as a fake sample (extra class). The underlying idea is that adding large fake visual data forces real samples to be close in the feature space, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification. To ensure a higher quality of generated images by GANs with consequently improved pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated data, i.e., we provide class level information to the generator. We test our approaches on several challenging benchmarking visual datasets, i.e. PASCAL, SiftFLow, Stanford and CamVid, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.606","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237868.pdf","startPage":"5689","endPage":"5697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Generative Adversarial Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Semi Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Generative Adversarial Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467863","htmlLink":"/document/8237868/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092719S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8237870,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Dong","affiliation":["Imperial College London"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085877430"},{"name":"Simiao Yu","affiliation":["Imperial College London"],"firstName":"Simiao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086291441"},{"name":"Chao Wu","affiliation":["Imperial College London"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wu","id":"38238398700"},{"name":"Yike Guo","affiliation":["Imperial College London"],"firstName":"Yike","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085533972"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237870","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Gallium nitride","Image generation","Semantics","Training","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target text description","image features","semantic information","end-to-end neural architecture","adversarial learning","semantic image synthesis","natural language description","intelligent image manipulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a way of synthesizing realistic images directly with natural language description, which has many useful applications, e.g. intelligent image manipulation. We attempt to accomplish such synthesis: given a source image and a target text description, our model synthesizes images to meet two requirements: 1) being realistic while matching the target text description; 2) maintaining other image features that are irrelevant to the text description. The model should be able to disentangle the semantic information from the two modalities (image and text), and generate new images from the combined semantics. To achieve this, we proposed an end-to-end neural architecture that leverages adversarial learning to automatically learn implicit loss functions, which are optimized to fulfill the aforementioned two requirements. We have evaluated our model by conducting experiments on Caltech-200 bird dataset and Oxford-102 flower dataset, and have demonstrated that our model is capable of synthesizing realistic images that match the given descriptions, while still maintain other features of original images.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.608","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","startPage":"5707","endPage":"5715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Image Synthesis via Adversarial Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Image Synthesis via Adversarial Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237870/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453271","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237870/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Image Synthesis via Adversarial Learning","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f707.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066764S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237871,"authors":[{"name":"Saeid Motiian","affiliation":["West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Motiian","id":"37085557119"},{"name":"Marco Piccirilli","affiliation":["West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Piccirilli","id":"37864060800"},{"name":"Donald A.

The main idea is to exploit the Siamese architecture to learn an embedding subspace that is discriminative, and where mapped visual domains are semantically aligned and yet maximally separated. The supervised setting becomes attractive especially when only few target data samples need to be labeled. In this scenario, alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is difficult because of the lack of data. We found that by reverting to point-wise surrogates of distribution distances and similarities provides an effective solution. In addition, the approach has a high \u201cspeed\u201d of adaptation, which requires an extremely low number of labeled target training samples, even one per category can be effective. The approach is extended to domain generalization.

We define a clustering objective function using relative entropy (KL divergence) minimization, regularized by a prior for the frequency of cluster assignments.

In contrast to other global pooling operators and CNN compression techniques the proposed method utilizes a trainable pooling layer that it is end-to-end differentiable, allowing the network to be trained using regular back-propagation and to achieve greater distribution shift invariance than competitive methods.

However, recent research has shown that there exist many adversarial examples that can negatively impact the performance of such an architecture. This paper focuses on detecting those adversarial examples by analyzing whether they come from the same distribution as the normal examples. Instead of directly training a deep neural network to detect adversarials, a much simpler approach was proposed based on statistics on outputs from convolutional layers. A cascade classifier was designed to efficiently detect adversarials. Furthermore, trained from one particular adversarial generating mechanism, the resulting classifier can successfully detect adversarials from a completely different mechanism as well. The resulting classifier is non-subdifferentiable, hence creates a difficulty for adversaries to attack by using the gradient of the classifier. After detecting adversarial examples, we show that many of them can be recovered by simply performing a small average filter on the image.

We introduce a new model, Region Convolutional 3D Network (R-C3D), which encodes the video streams using a three-dimensional fully convolutional network, then generates candidate temporal regions containing activities, and finally classifies selected regions into specific activities. Computation is saved due to the sharing of convolutional features between the proposal and the classification pipelines. The entire model is trained end-to-end with jointly optimized localization and classification losses. R-C3D is faster than existing methods (569 frames per second on a single Titan X Maxwell GPU) and achieves state-of-the-art results on THUMOS'14. We further demonstrate that our model is a general activity detection framework that does not rely on assumptions about particular dataset properties by evaluating our approach on ActivityNet and Charades.

However, the impact of deep learning on video analysis has been limited due to complexity of video data and lack of annotations. Previous convolutional neural networks (CNN) based video action detection approaches usually consist of two major steps: frame-level action proposal generation and association of proposals across frames. Also, most of these methods employ two-stream CNN framework to handle spatial and temporal feature separately. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep network called Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for action detection in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified deep network that is able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features. A video is first divided into equal length clips and next for each clip a set of tube proposals are generated based on 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features. Finally, the tube proposals of different clips are linked together employing network flow and spatio-temporal action detection is performed using these linked video proposals. Extensive experiments on several video datasets demonstrate the superior performance of T-CNN for classifying and localizing actions in both trimmed and untrimmed videos compared to state-of-the-arts.","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237882.pdf","startPage":"5823","endPage":"5832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for Action Detection in Videos","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for Action Detection in Videos","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467869","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237882/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for Action Detection in Videos","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078167S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8237884,"authors":[{"name":"Raghav Goyal","affiliation":["Interfaculty Department of Remote Sensing and GIS, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Raghav","lastName":"Goyal","id":"37086330755"},{"name":"Samira Ebrahimi Kahou","firstName":"Samira Ebrahimi","lastName":"Kahou","id":"37547689800"},{"name":"Vincent Michalski","firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Michalski","id":"37086154678"},{"name":"Joanna Materzynska","firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"Materzynska","id":"37086184324"},{"name":"Susanne Westphal","firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Westphal","id":"37088730315"},{"name":"Heuna Kim","firstName":"Heuna","lastName":"Kim","id":"37088741984"},{"name":"Valentin Haenel","firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Haenel","id":"37088746307"},{"name":"Ingo Fruend","firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Fruend","id":"37088745618"},{"name":"Peter Yianilos","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Yianilos","id":"37088736165"},{"name":"Moritz Mueller-Freitag","firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Mueller-Freitag","id":"37088745363"},{"name":"Florian Hoppe","firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Hoppe","id":"37861625100"},{"name":"Christian Thurau","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Thurau","id":"37671378400"},{"name":"Ingo Bax","firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Bax","id":"37087793297"},{"name":"Roland Memisevic","firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Memisevic","id":"37426334900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237884","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Physics","Natural languages","Neural networks","Databases","Poles and towers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowdsourcing","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","video databases","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual common sense learning","video prediction tasks","crowdsourcing","something something video database","common sense understanding","high-level concepts","labelled video datasets","detailed information","physical world","common sense knowledge","natural language","visual knowledge","complex scenes","visual object classification","ImageNet","neural networks"]}],"abstract":"Neural networks trained on datasets such as ImageNet have led to major advances in visual object classification.

Under this approach, each inverse problem requires its own dedicated network. In scenarios where we need to solve a wide variety of problems, e.g., on a mobile camera, it is inefficient and expensive to use these problem-specific networks. On the other hand, traditional methods using analytic signal priors can be used to solve any linear inverse problem; this often comes with a performance that is worse than learning-based methods. In this work, we provide a middle ground between the two kinds of methods - we propose a general framework to train a single deep neural network that solves arbitrary linear inverse problems. We achieve this by training a network that acts as a quasi-projection operator for the set of natural images and show that any linear inverse problem involving natural images can be solved using iterative methods. We empirically show that the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods using wavelet sparsity prior while achieving performance comparable to specially-trained networks on tasks including compressive sensing and pixel-wise inpainting.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.627","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237889.pdf","startPage":"5889","endPage":"5898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One Network to Solve Them All \u2014 Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using Deep Projection Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"One Network to Solve Them All \u2014 Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using Deep Projection Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237889/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17453102","htmlLink":"/document/8237889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One Network to Solve Them All \u2014 Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using Deep Projection Models","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117822S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237890,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Noroozi","affiliation":["University of Bern"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Noroozi","id":"37086295851"},{"name":"Hamed Pirsiavash","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore County"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Pirsiavash","id":"37418417800"},{"name":"Paolo Favaro","affiliation":["University of Bern"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Favaro","id":"37282918600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237890","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"We introduce a novel method for representation learning that uses an artificial supervision signal based on counting visual primitives.

In this paper, we use two image transformations in the context of counting: scaling and tiling. The first transformation exploits the fact that the number of visual primitives should be invariant to scale. The second transformation allows us to equate the total number of visual primitives in each tile to that in the whole image. These two transformations are combined in one constraint and used to train a neural network with a contrastive loss. The proposed task produces representations that perform on par or exceed the state of the art in transfer learning benchmarks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237890.pdf","startPage":"5899","endPage":"5907","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representation Learning by Learning to Count","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image color analysis","Nose","Training","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["representation learning","artificial supervision signal","visual primitives","equivariance relation","manual annotation","image transformations","transfer learning benchmarks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Representation Learning by Learning to Count","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8237890/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453262","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation Learning by Learning to Count","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f899.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103013S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8237891,"authors":[{"name":"Han Zhang","affiliation":["Rutgers University"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085472192"},{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Lehigh University"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085413559"},{"name":"Hongsheng Li","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hongsheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37539766300"},{"name":"Shaoting Zhang","affiliation":["Baidu Research"],"firstName":"Shaoting","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086262892"},{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086269902"},{"name":"Xiaolei Huang","affiliation":["Lehigh University"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086004564"},{"name":"Dimitris Metaxas","affiliation":["Rutgers University"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Metaxas","id":"37270535700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237891","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":438,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2088},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237891","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Training","Generators","Manifolds","Image resolution","Shape","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","image representation","image resolution","object recognition","realistic images","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sketch-refinement process","sketches the primitive shape","colors","given text description","low-resolution images","Stage-II GAN","Stage-I results","text descriptions","high-resolution images","photo-realistic details","synthesized images","StackGAN","photo-realistic image synthesis","stacked generative adversarial networks","existing textto- image approaches","vivid object parts"]}],"abstract":"Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing textto- image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256.256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.629","startPage":"5908","endPage":"5916","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237891.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"StackGAN: Text to Photo-Realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237891/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"StackGAN: Text to Photo-Realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467824","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8237891/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"StackGAN: Text to Photo-Realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118119S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"438","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8237892,"authors":[{"name":"Kihyuk Sohn","affiliation":["NEC Labs America"],"firstName":"Kihyuk","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37086272258"},{"name":"Sifei Liu","affiliation":["UC Merced"],"firstName":"Sifei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085716631"},{"name":"Guangyu Zhong","affiliation":["Dalian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Guangyu","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085570058"},{"name":"Xiang Yu","affiliation":["NEC Labs America"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085811163"},{"name":"Ming-Hsuan Yang","affiliation":["UC Merced"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085519912"},{"name":"Manmohan Chandraker","affiliation":["UC San Diego","NEC Labs America"],"firstName":"Manmohan","lastName":"Chandraker","id":"37397476800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1032-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1033-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-7504"}],"articleNumber":"8237892","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Face recognition","Face","Knowledge engineering","Image restoration","Kernel","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image matching","image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative knowledge transfer","domain-invariant feature learning","video face recognition performance","feature-level domain adaptation framework","YouTube Faces","video domain-specific factors","boosts high-quality frames","discriminator-guided feature fusion","domain adversarial discriminator","feature restoration","feature matching","video adaptation network","face recognition network","large-scale unlabeled video data","discriminative video frame representations","video feature-level domain adaptation approach","diverse large-scale video datasets","video-based face recognition","unlabeled videos","unsupervised domain adaptation"]}],"abstract":"Despite rapid advances in face recognition, there remains a clear gap between the performance of still image-based face recognition and video-based face recognition, due to the vast difference in visual quality between the domains and the difficulty of curating diverse large-scale video datasets. This paper addresses both of those challenges, through an image to video feature-level domain adaptation approach, to learn discriminative video frame representations. The framework utilizes large-scale unlabeled video data to reduce the gap between different domains while transferring discriminative knowledge from large-scale labeled still images. Given a face recognition network that is pretrained in the image domain, the adaptation is achieved by (i) distilling knowledge from the network to a video adaptation network through feature matching, (ii) performing feature restoration through synthetic data augmentation and (iii) learning a domain-invariant feature through a domain adversarial discriminator. We further improve performance through a discriminator-guided feature fusion that boosts high-quality frames while eliminating those degraded by video domain-specific factors. Experiments on the YouTube Faces and IJB-A datasets demonstrate that each module contributes to our feature-level domain adaptation framework and substantially improves video face recognition performance to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. We demonstrate qualitatively that the network learns to suppress diverse artifacts in videos such as pose, illumination or occlusion without being explicitly trained for them.","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.2017.630","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8234942/8237262/08237892.pdf","startPage":"5917","endPage":"5925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8237262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Face Recognition in Unlabeled Videos","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8237892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8237892/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Face Recognition in Unlabeled Videos","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17453220","htmlLink":"/document/8237892/","conferenceDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Face Recognition in Unlabeled Videos","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"1032f917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078893S","chronDate":"22-29 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8234942","isNumber":"8237262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8234942","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8237262","articleId":"8237892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8238075,"authors":[{"name":"Ayse Betul Oktay","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ayse","lastName":"Betul Oktay","id":"37657897000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0633-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0634-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8238075","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":732},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8238075","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Machine learning","Dentistry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dentistry","diagnostic radiography","image classification","medical image processing","neural nets","X-ray imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerized dental applications","tooth detection","Convolutional Neural Networks","dental panoramic X-ray images","computerized tooth applications","multi-class classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural networks","deep learning","dental image"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIPTEKNO.2017.8238075","pdfPath":"/iel7/8210982/8238022/08238075.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 Medical Technologies National Congress (TIPTEKNO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Medical Technologies National Congress (TIPTEKNO)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8238022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIPTEKNO.2017.8238075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tooth detection with Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Detection of teeth from dental panoramic X-ray images is the a crucial step for the computerized tooth applications.

In a multipath environment, bit error rate (BER) is dominated by few subcarriers with small amplitudes because of the deep fades. This requires employing forward error correction (FEC) method on the data transferred in order to compensate for the burst errors that occur in physical channel. To this end, we adopt polar codes which are the latest breakthrough in coding theory. We propose polar coded OFDM (PCOFDM) system to improve the bit error rate (BER) of OFDM. The simulation results on an AWGN channel using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) show that PCOFDM system exhibits better bit error rate (BER) performance than the low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded OFDM (LDPC-COFDM) system under similar channel conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8238148/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17467550","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8238148/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the polar coded OFDM system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the polar coded OFDM system","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1570366745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043277S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8200356","isNumber":"8238017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8200356","xplore-issue":"8238017","articleId":"8238148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8238160,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Nouasria","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, INPT, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Nouasria","id":"37086112617"},{"name":"Mohamed Et-tolba","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, INPT, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Et-tolba","id":"38277366300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2123-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2122-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2124-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8238160","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"abstract":"Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new methodology to reconstruct sparse signals from a few number of measurements.

over Nakagami-m fading channel","abstract":"In order to keep up with countless emerging applications requirements, cellular systems have to embed new flexible aspects, with the aim of satisfying future wireless environments expectations. In this context, we consider a cellular system based a full-duplex amplify-and-forward cooperative communication over Nakagami-m channel. We assume the direct link between the source and the destination is non-negligible and we propose a combining scheme, at the destination side, that captures the joint benefit of relay and direct links. In order to meet with mission-critical applications requirements namely, low latency and reliability, the paper investigates the latency impact on the system performance and highlights the system diversity through the use of a combining scheme. First, we derive a new closedform expression of the studied system outage probability. Then, we confirm the theoretical results with Monte-carlo simulations. Furthermore, for more consistent analysis, we compare our combining scheme to Selective Decode-and-forward (SDF) scheme, recently proposed for full-duplex relaying as well as to some classical schemes. Simulation results show that they outperform each other depending on the relay processing delay, packet length, and the direct link gain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8238163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8238163/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467553","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis for amplify and forward full-duplex relaying with direct link over Nakagami-m fading channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis for amplify and forward full-duplex relaying with direct link over Nakagami-m fading channel","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1570374388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063115S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8200356","isNumber":"8238017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8200356","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8238017","articleId":"8238163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8238167,"authors":[{"name":"Elmehdi Illi","affiliation":["ENSIAS, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Elmehdi","lastName":"Illi","id":"37086072204"},{"name":"Faissal El Bouanani","affiliation":["ENSIAS, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Faissal El","lastName":"Bouanani","id":"37085583135"},{"name":"Fouad Ayoub","affiliation":["ENSIAS, Mohammed V University in Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Fouad","lastName":"Ayoub","id":"37086069210"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2123-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2122-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2124-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8238167","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Atmospheric modeling","Signal to noise ratio","5G mobile communication","Receivers","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","atmospheric optics","atmospheric turbulence","diversity reception","fading channels","modulation","optical links","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moment generating function","free space optical technology","maximal ratio combining technique","hybrid 5G RF-FSO transmission system","hybrid 5G RF-FSO communication system","Malaga-M turbulence model","total signal-to-noise ratio","bivariate Fox H-Function","moment generating function","Weibull fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid 5G RF/FSO transmission system","RadioFrequency (RF)","free-space optics (FSO)","Weibull fading channel","M\u00e1laga-M turbulence","MRC","pointing error impairment","MGF","ASER","Fox's H-Function"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a study on the performance of a hybrid 5G RF/FSO communication system.

The TR method exploits the null sub-carriers for generating a corrective signal, in the Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T) to reduce the PAPR.

It is much simpler than the probabilistic methods like Sum Product Algorithm (SPA), and can be efficiently implemented by electronic circuits.

Compared to the Gallager Bit-Flipping algorithm, the proposed algorithm employs criteria of flipping single bit chosen carefully. This method eliminates the risk for flipping more than one bit at a time that can induce additional error bits and propagate the errors to the later iterations. We present some results obtained by applying this new method that provides a gain in performance in comparison to the standard Gallager Bit-Flipping with low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/WINCOM.2017.8238191","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8200356/8238017/08238191.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8238017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WINCOM.2017.8238191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New hard decision decoder of LDPC codes using single Bit Flipping algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8238191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"New hard decision decoder of LDPC codes using single Bit Flipping algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8238191/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17467540","htmlLink":"/document/8238191/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New hard decision decoder of LDPC codes using single Bit Flipping algorithm","confLoc":"Rabat, Morocco","sourcePdf":"1570377522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091257S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8200356","isNumber":"8238017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8200356","xplore-issue":"8238017","articleId":"8238191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8238193,"authors":[{"name":"Mokhtar Bouteggui","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, LISIC Laboratory Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mokhtar","lastName":"Bouteggui","id":"37086272121"},{"name":"Fatiha Merazka","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, LISIC Laboratory Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Fatiha","lastName":"Merazka","id":"37564894500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2123-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2122-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2124-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8238193","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","protocols","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol error rate","diversity order","Space Time Block Coding","M-ary phase shift keying","Rayleigh fading distribution","decode and forward relaying protocol","single relay multiple input multiple output","MIMO cooperative communication system based DF protocol","transmit antenna selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Cooperative Communication","Antenna Selection","Space Time block Coding"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we study the performance of a single relay Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) cooperative communication system based on Decode and Forward (DF) relaying protocol for two strategies using transmit antenna selection at the source.

Here, it is assumed that the system dynamics contains bounded unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances. Also, it is assumed that all the states in the system can be measured using a set of sensors, but there is a source of noise on each of the sensors with a white noise model. The design procedure is proposed using online solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The algorithm includes two separate robust adaptive laws for estimating the unknown nonlinear and linear terms. The adaptive law for estimation of the nonlinear terms is a model-free estimation algorithm, since it does not require any regressor parameters. In addition, a Kalman-filter is used to observe the values of the states free of the measurement noises. Moreover, a technique is presented to update the values for controller gain in an online manner. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied on simulation of the Duffing-Holmes chaotic system with tracking objective.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CACIS.2017.8239033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239002","startPage":"56","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems (I2CACIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171442/8239002/08239033.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimal adaptive model-free control with a Kalman-filter-based observer for a generic nonlinear MIMO system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239033/","displayDocTitle":"An optimal adaptive model-free control with a Kalman-filter-based observer for a generic nonlinear MIMO system","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452506","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal adaptive model-free control with a Kalman-filter-based observer for a generic nonlinear MIMO system","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"011ID23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064902S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171442","isNumber":"8239002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171442","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8239002","articleId":"8239033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8239034,"authors":[{"name":"Min Keng Tan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min Keng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37853110000"},{"name":"Helen Sin Ee Chuo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Helen Sin Ee","lastName":"Chuo","id":"38667323500"},{"name":"Renee Ka Yin Chin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Renee Ka Yin","lastName":"Chin","id":"37085404129"},{"name":"Kiam Beng Yeo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kiam","lastName":"Beng Yeo","id":"37085350100"},{"name":"Kenneth Tze Kin Teo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kenneth Tze Kin","lastName":"Teo","id":"37404084600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0846-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-0845-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0847-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8239034","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Delays","Heuristic algorithms","Conferences","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","genetic algorithms","minimisation","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DGA","decentralized genetic algorithm","signalized traffic network","historical traffic data","comprehensive traffic model","traffic network signal timing optimization","network delay reduction","average delay minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","traffic signal optimization","decentralized control system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239034","abstract":"This work aims to minimize average delay for signalized traffic network along Jalan UMS under oversaturated condition using decentralized genetic algorithm (DGA).

VANET shows a promising technology as it could enhance the traffic efficiency and promote traffic safety on the road systems. The conventional store-and-forward transmission protocol used in the intermediate node(s) simply stores the received packet and then send at a later time to the destination. However, the rapid changing in VANET topology has made the conventional store-and-forward approach inefficient to meet the throughput and reliability demand posed by VANET. Hence, NC is proposed to perform additional functions on the packet in the source or intermediate node(s). However, the chances to perform NC in wireless network is highly unlikely if the packet is not transmit to the potential NC node. Therefore, GA based network routing (GANeR) is embedded into network to search for shortest path from the source to the destination. It showed that the developed GANER in this work provides a better route with coding opportunities and reduces energy consumption in the network. The total energy consumed by GANER is 5.6% fewer than NC in wireless network transmission and forwarding structure (COPE).","doi":"10.1109/I2CACIS.2017.8239037","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems (I2CACIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171442/8239002/08239037.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems (I2CACIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CACIS.2017.8239037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for management of coding resources in VANET","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Vehicular ad hoc networks","Wireless networks","Encoding","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","network coding","power consumption","protocols","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["store-and-forward approach","coding resource management","VANET","road systems","store-and-forward transmission protocol","forwarding structure","VANET topology","received packet","traffic safety","traffic efficiency","network coding","vehicular ad hoc network","genetic algorithm","wireless network transmission","energy consumption","GA based network routing","intermediate node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VANET","intelligent transportation system","network coding","genetic algorithm","evolutionary algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for management of coding resources in VANET","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239037/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467405","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for management of coding resources in VANET","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"015ID27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058307S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171442","isNumber":"8239002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171442","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8239002","articleId":"8239037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8239039,"authors":[{"name":"Helen Sin Ee Chuo","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Helen Sin Ee","lastName":"Chuo","id":"38667323500"},{"name":"Min Keng Tan","affiliation":["Modelling, Simulation & Computing Laboratory Faculty of Engineering, University Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Min Keng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37853110000"},{"name":"Alex Chee Hoe Chong","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Alex Chee Hoe","lastName":"Chong","id":"37087340826"},{"name":"Renee Ka Yin Chin","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Renee Ka Yin","lastName":"Chin","id":"37085404129"},{"name":"Kenneth Tze Kin Teo","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, MY"],"firstName":"Kenneth Tze Kin","lastName":"Teo","id":"37404084600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0846-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-0845-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0847-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8239039","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239039","abstract":"Urban congestion in major cities of Malaysia is getting severe over decades with increasing active vehicles and travelling time on the road.

A multiple-intersection traffic system has been developed using probability and statistical model based on the real case traffic data collected from local traffic intersection. Enhanced particle swarm optimisation algorithm is developed to ensure result consistency with smaller variation. As a result, the algorithm suggested signal timing increases the average waiting time of non-congested directions by approximately 4.17% but reduces the queue length at congested junction

important role in transfer energy in the technology world. These storage batteries have nonlinear behaviors against increasing their temperature. Therefore, thermal effect as one of important parameters is considered for modeling these accumulators. An artificial neural network is subset of computational intelligence approaches method that can identify a wide range of complex systems with the highest accuracy. In addition, this approach does not require much knowledge from the systems and is used as a black box model. In this paper, a dynamic artificial neural network approach based on Nonlinear Autoregressive eXogenous (NARX) model to analyze thermal behaviors of a Li-ion battery is presented. The proposed network is trained by Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. In this method, discharge-load voltage and discharge-measured temperature of a li-ion is considered as input and output of the network respectively. The input and output data are provided from an experimental test that was carried out by one of the research centers of NASA.

The system can be used to detect misplaced and missing components of printed circuit boards during the manufacturing process. Jigsaw puzzle pieces can be used to simulate the scenario of misplaced and missing components. The developed system consists of image processing and neural network phases. During image processing, the captured image is split into regions and the red-green-blue (RGB) value of the regions is obtained. The back-propagation neural network is used and is trained by the scaled conjugate gradient training algorithm. The neural network uses the RGB value obtained from image processing and analyzes regions to determine if a jigsaw puzzle piece is missing or misplaced. Two experiments on time performance have been conducted to analyze regions and the ability of the system to detect misplaced and missing jigsaw puzzle pieces. Results showed that the system requires approximately 89 s to process 20 pieces of the image. The system exhibits almost 100% accuracy in detecting missing or misplaced regions of a jigsaw puzzle image.","doi":"10.1109/I2CACIS.2017.8239046","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171442/8239002/08239046.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"139","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems (I2CACIS)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Automatic Control and Intelligent Systems (I2CACIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CACIS.2017.8239046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network for the detection of misplaced and missing regions in images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Neural network for the detection of misplaced and missing regions in images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17452505","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239046/","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network for the detection of misplaced and missing regions in images","confLoc":"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"024ID45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069931S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171442","isNumber":"8239002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171442","xplore-issue":"8239002","articleId":"8239046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8239052,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Y.

To overcome this limitation, the AUV can home into a docking station to recharge its battery. Several research has been conducted on the docking of AUV using vision. In some literatures, docking would fail if the target placed at the docking station is missing or disoriented from the camera view. This study proposes a deep learning system to detect the target markers to solve the disoriented view issues. The proposed system comprises of two phases which are training and testing. In training phase, there are region proposal, labeling data, developing convolutional neural network architecture, and network training.

The objective is to reach a destination goal by the mean of an autonomous computed optimal path calculated through optimal control sequence. Solving such complex systems often requires a great amount of computation. However, the approach considered herein is based on the Decomposition Coordination principle, which allows the nonlinearity to be treated at a local level, thus offering a low computing time. The stability of the method is discussed with sufficient conditions for convergence.

One of the protocols that are already standardized by ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory consumption. Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol only provides authentication for the security mechanism which, by default, does not encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy, authentication, and data integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate security mechanism. Next, it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally, after the vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined, we can improve our security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack.","doi":"10.1109/EECSI.2017.8239179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EECSI.2017.8239179","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8215807/8239062/08239179.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attack scenarios and security analysis of MQTT communication protocol in IoT system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Attack scenarios and security analysis of MQTT communication protocol in IoT system","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239179/","accessionNumber":"17467636","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239179/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attack scenarios and security analysis of MQTT communication protocol in IoT system","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p571andy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079178S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8215807","isNumber":"8239062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8215807","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8239062","articleId":"8239179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8239181,"authors":[{"name":"Teguh Prakoso","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Teguh","lastName":"Prakoso","id":"37596574100"},{"name":"Munawar Agus Riyadi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Munawar Agus","lastName":"Riyadi","id":"37303941900"},{"name":"Razali Ngah","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Centre, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Razali","lastName":"Ngah","id":"37398327200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0549-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-0547-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0550-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8239181","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"abstract":"Radio-over-fiber (RoF) technologies address wireless communication's need for high data rate, protocol-transparency, and flexibility. One of challenge in RoF access point design is RF amplifier requirement that match to microwave-photonic link chosen and service range needed. This paper proposes a graphical approach as systematic method to solve the challenge. The method identifies two regions, i.e. (a) scalable region where amplifiers' output 1-dB compression point (OP1dB) improvement can enhance system's maximum input and output power, and (b) saturation region where any improvement on amplifiers' OP1dB cannot improve AP's maximum input and output power. The methods have been verified by system simulations. The errors at scalable and saturation regions are less than 1 dB and the standard deviation is no more than 0.6 dB. The error values around the breakpoint between scalable and saturation regions are around 1 dB. Therefore, the proposed graphical approach can be used in the specification tradeoff between RoF access point input and output power, amplifier's gain and OP1dB.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Optical fiber amplifiers","Gain","Downlink","Mathematical model","Power generation","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","microwave photonics","MMIC amplifiers","protocols","radiofrequency amplifiers","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphical approach","systematic method","amplifiers","output power","saturation region","system simulations","RoF access point input","RF amplifier specification","fiber system","wireless communication","protocol-transparency","RoF access point design","RF amplifier requirement","microwave-photonic link","input power","Radio-over-fiber technologies","maximum power issues","noise figure 1.0 dB","noise figure 0.6 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["graphical approach","radio-over-fiber","RF amplifier","microwave photonics","access point"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EECSI.2017.8239181","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Informatics (EECSI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8215807/8239062/08239181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EECSI.2017.8239181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphical approach for RF amplifier specification in radio over fiber system: Maximum power issues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Graphical approach for RF amplifier specification in radio over fiber system: Maximum power issues","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239181/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239181/","accessionNumber":"17467652","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphical approach for RF amplifier specification in radio over fiber system: Maximum power issues","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p580prakoso.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054238S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8215807","isNumber":"8239062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8215807","xplore-issue":"8239062","articleId":"8239181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8239186,"authors":[{"name":"Arief Marwanto","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical Engineering-Post Graduated Studies, Univ.

Moreover, a complexity of signal processing library in a SDR platform has contributed to the hard implementation in real applications. In this works, the development of SDR platform with low cost expenditure is proposed. Arduino UNO and X Bee uses for the OFDM based spectrum exchange information. In a case of spectrum sensing scenario, the objective of the local spectrum sensing is to detect the PU's signal detection. The performance of SN ability to sense the PU's signal is crucial. It was shown that from the previous works as the detected power is quantized into information bit is simulated. In order to implemented the spectrum exchange information during sensing, Arduino UNO and X Bee is implemented to sense the presence of PU activity channels of wifi terminals based on the energy of the signals. The detected power (RSSI) of wifi terminals is exchanged into an OFDM subcarrier tone signal such as orthogonal sub-channel that being equally divided from the licensed band. The results shows that using proposed software defined radio (SDR) based on Arduino and X Bee, the cognitive radio spectrum sensing is applied. The received power from the PU's channels such as wifi networks can be detected as well.

Through a number of focus groups, and interviews with presently active non-governmental organizations (NGOs), a working set of needs, and technical specifications to meet them, was produced. In February of 2016, our prototype vehicle, MOVE (Mobile Outreach VEhicle) was completed. At that point we had only supposition as to how well our design would address the needs at a disaster location. We needed to validate the performance of our design, and its usefulness as an adjunct to existing disaster response technologies. Secondarily, it was important to determine how we could mobilize IEEE member volunteers to complete this relief package. This paper reviews our experience at six disaster sites at which the MOVE was deployed in the last year. A great deal has been learned about the problem domain from interacting with victims, NGOs, and governmental agencies. All of these have found the MOVE to be of value in a disaster situation. This paper should prove valuable in developing future plans for our organization, and for others who may wish to replicate this work to some degree.","doi":"10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GHTC.2017.8239332","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8215842/8239217/08239332.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference (GHTC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The IEEE MOVE disaster relief vehicle: Lessons learned from one year of operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"The IEEE MOVE disaster relief vehicle: Lessons learned from one year of operation","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239332/","accessionNumber":"17467725","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239332/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The IEEE MOVE disaster relief vehicle: Lessons learned from one year of operation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1570362389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053101S","chronDate":"19-22 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8215842","isNumber":"8239217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8215842","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8239217","articleId":"8239332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239445,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Both the search for the latest technical solutions and the improvement of known devices remain relevant. These trends are also true for permanent magnet motors used as a propulsion system for an unmanned aerial vehicle. The purpose of the research is to calculate and model an electric motor for an unmanned aerial vehicle by the finite element method using the ELCUT package. The principle research tasks are to choose an appropriate representation method for permanent magnets on the electric motor rotor and stator winding as well as to evaluate the results of modeling in the ELCUT software complex. Methods of computer modeling using applied software complexes, methods of magnetic field analysis in the air gap, methods of equivalent circuits were applied. The analysis results show that permanent magnet electric motors are commonly used as propulsion systems for unmanned aerial vehicles. The major challenges with electric motor modeling arising from the representation methods for the rotor magnets and stator winding were defined. The model of a permanent magnet motor for an unmanned aerial vehicle was created. The results of the permanent magnet electric motor modeling for an unmanned aerial vehicle were represented, proving the robustness of calculations and solution of posed problems. The research results can be applied in calculation and modeling of electric motors with surface distribution of magnets on a rotor and distributed winding on a stator, and under the uniform distribution of different number of magnets to poles relative to slots.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling permanent magnet electric motor for unmanned aerial vehicle","publicationTitle":"2017 Dynamics of Systems, Mechanisms and Machines (Dynamics)","doi":"10.1109/Dynamics.2017.8239484","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Dynamics of Systems, Mechanisms and Machines (Dynamics)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8215808/8239422/08239484.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Dynamics.2017.8239484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239422","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Modeling permanent magnet electric motor for unmanned aerial vehicle","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239484/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17467680","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling permanent magnet electric motor for unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Omsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"Lyutarevich.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044488S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8215808","isNumber":"8239422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8215808","xplore-issue":"8239422","articleId":"8239484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8239494,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

By phase-locking the receiver comb to the transmitted pilot tone, carrier offsets are suppressed while both the overhead and complexity associated with the pilot tone are reduced. We form a 55 carrier superchannel using a 25-GHz spaced electro-optic frequency comb seeded by a 100-kHz linewidth laser. At a pilot tone overhead of <;2%, the reduction in carrier offsets is shown to facilitate blind DSP-based carrier recovery of all 54 \u00d7 24 Gbaud PM-128QAM data channels. The resulting superchannel spectral efficiency is 10.3 bits/s/Hz assuming a 28% overhead for forward error correction. Our results show the potential for optical pilot tones to reduce both overhead and complexity in systems using comb-based superchannels together with high-order modulation formats.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2786750","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8299502/08239584.pdf","startPage":"1318","endPage":"1325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2786750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Spectral Efficiency PM-128QAM Comb-Based Superchannel Transmission Enabled by a Single Shared Optical Pilot Tone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239584/","displayDocTitle":"High Spectral Efficiency PM-128QAM Comb-Based Superchannel Transmission Enabled by a Single Shared Optical Pilot Tone","volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17596315","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239584/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish research council","grantNumber":"2014-06138"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"High Spectral Efficiency PM-128QAM Comb-Based Superchannel Transmission Enabled by a Single Shared Optical Pilot Tone","sourcePdf":"jlt-mazur-2786750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093215S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8299502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8299502","articleId":"8239584","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239591,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanwei Hou","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in Telecommunications, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8430490/8239591/hou-2786705-small.gif","p":["Zhanwei Hou received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2014.

To enable this, in future IoT system, besides the traditional data access points (DAPs) for collecting data, energy access points (EAPs) should be deployed to charge IoT devices to maintain their sustainable operations. Practically, the DAPs and EAPs may be operated by different operators, and the DAPs thus need to provide effective incentives to motivate the surrounding EAPs to charge their associated IoT devices. Different from existing incentive schemes, we consider a practical scenario with asymmetric information, where the DAP is not aware of the channel conditions and energy costs of the EAPs. We first extend the existing Stackelberg game-based approach with complete information to the asymmetric information scenario, where the expected utility of the DAP is defined and maximized. To deal with asymmetric information more efficiently, we then develop a contract theory-based framework, where the optimal contract is derived to maximize the DAP's expected utility as well as the social welfare. Simulations show that information asymmetry leads to severe performance degradation for the Stackelberg game-based framework, while the proposed contract theory-based approach using asymmetric information outperforms the Stackelberg game-based method with complete information. This reveals that the performance of the considered system depends largely on the market structure (i.e., whether the EAPs are allowed to optimize their received power at the IoT devices with full freedom or not) than on the information availability (i.e., the complete or asymmetric information).","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2786705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2786705","startPage":"2620","endPage":"2632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8430490/08239591.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive Mechanism Design for Wireless Energy Harvesting-Based Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Incentive Mechanism Design for Wireless Energy Harvesting-Based Internet of Things","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2018","accessionNumber":"18025507","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239591/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FL160100032 and DP150104019"},{"fundingName":"International Postgraduate Research Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"Australian Postgraduate Award"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP150104019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61531006 and 61772233"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive Mechanism Design for Wireless Energy Harvesting-Based Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-chen-2786705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092887S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8430490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8430490","articleId":"8239591","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239592,"authors":[{"name":"Ruki Harwahyu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8239592/harwa-2786680-small.gif","p":["Ruki Harwahyu received the B.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia (UI), Depok, Indonesia, in 2011, and the master\u2019s degree from UI and the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering.","His current research interests include communication networks and Internet of Things."]},"firstName":"Ruki","lastName":"Harwahyu","orcid":"0000-0003-3580-9128","id":"38235181100"},{"name":"Ray-Guang Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8239592/cheng-2786680-small.gif","p":["Ray-Guang Cheng (S\u201994\u2013M\u201997\u2013SM\u201907) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1991, 1993, and 1996, respectively, all in communication engineering.","From 1997 to 2000, he was a Researcher and a Project Leader with the Advance Technology Center, Computer and Communication Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Hsinchu.

Few-mode fibers offer the potential of transmitting several signals at the same wavelength over different modes of a fiber with one single core. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using few-mode fiber-based SDM systems for long-haul transmission. We analyze system limitations such as mode-dependent loss and Kerr-effect-based nonlinear signal distortions for different modulation formats and distances up to 3500 km. We find that mode-dependent loss poses the major limitation in the analyzed transmission system, masking most intermodal nonlinear interactions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-Haul Transmission Over Few-Mode Fibers With Space-Division Multiplexing","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2786671","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8299502/08239603.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2786671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8299502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Long-Haul Transmission Over Few-Mode Fibers With Space-Division Multiplexing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8239603/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2018","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17596309","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-Haul Transmission Over Few-Mode Fibers With Space-Division Multiplexing","sourcePdf":"jlt-rademacher-2786671-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077852S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8299502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8299502","articleId":"8239603","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8239604,"authors":[{"name":"Sithara Kanakaraj","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kozhikode, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8291076/8239604/kanak-2779795-small.gif","p":["Sithara Kanakaraj (S\u201917) received the M.Tech. degree in\n computer science (information security) from the National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kozhikode, India, where she\n is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in super resolution.","Her research interests include image enhancement, image super resolution, and image registration."]},"firstName":"Sithara","lastName":"Kanakaraj","orcid":"0000-0002-3529-9132","id":"37086275487"},{"name":"Madhu S.

The precision of the application degrades with the presence of inherent speckle and poor resolution of images from the SAR image acquisition devices. Thus, the objective of the proposed method is to develop a technique to enhance the resolution while despeckling the inherent noise, simultaneously, since the conventional super resolution methods have failed to do the same. Moreover, the works from the literature that super resolve SAR images have also neglected the signal-dependent noise model. The work proposed in this paper significantly reduces the speckle and super resolves the SAR image using an Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter framework that best models the non-linearity of the system. The technique has been assessed quantitatively and qualitatively on synthetic images as well as on real SAR images. The performance evaluation based on peak signal-to-noise-ratio, structural similarity index measure, feature similarity index measure, edge preservation factor, and equivalent number of looks values throw light on the superiority of the proposed method over the standard and other recent techniques. This can serve to generate images with a better reconstructive quality that would aid various applications in multidisciplinary domains.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8291076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2779795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8291076/08239604.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"571","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2779795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Image Super Resolution using Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"SAR Image Super Resolution using Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8239604/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17578110","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Image Super Resolution using Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter","sourcePdf":"jstars-nair-2779795-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072876S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8291076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8291076","articleId":"8239604","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239605,"authors":[{"name":"Iria Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8271882/8239605/lopez-2782080-small.gif","p":["Iria Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez (S\u201916) received the M.Sc. degree in industrial engineering with a specialization in electronics and automation from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2012.","She is currently a Researcher with the Broadband Mixed-Signal Group, Circuit Design Department, IHP Microelectronics, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany.

The technology role in the key performance metrics is also discussed and verified by means of two analogous TIA designs implemented in two different 130-nm SiGe:C BiCMOS processes from IHP, SG13S with fT/fmax = 250/340 GHz and SG13G2 with fT/fmax = 300/500 GHz. Both TIAs adopt a fully differential linear architecture with three stages: an input shunt-feedback TI stage followed by a variable gain amplifier which provides post-amplification with 15-dB gain control range and an output 50-\u03a9 buffer. The TIA in SG13S features 68.5 dBQ differential TI \u221a gain, 42-GHz 3-dB BW, and 8 pA/ Hz averaged input-referred current noise density while the second TIA in SG13G2 provides 65 dBQ differential TI gain, 66-GHz 3-dB BW, and 7.6 pA/\u221aHz. Measured total harmonic distortion in both TIAs in the maximum gain condition is better than 5% for ~800 mVppd output swing and input currents of ~300 \u03bcApp. Both circuits dissipate 150 mW of power and are shown to operate at up to 100 Gb/s data rate with clean PRBS31 non-return to zero and PAM-4 eye diagrams. To the author's best knowledge, the reported TIAs exhibit the lowest averaged input-referred current noise density shown to date at a BW sufficient to support 100 Gb/s net data rate, surpassing other silicon-based and InP implementations toward the next-generation 400 Gb/s optical links.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2017.2782080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2017.2782080","startPage":"458","endPage":"469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/8271882/08239605.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"100 Gb/s Differential Linear TIAs With Less Than 10 pA/ $\\sqrt {\\mathrm {Hz}}$ in 130-nm SiGe:C BiCMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"100 Gb/s Differential Linear TIAs With Less Than 10 pA/ $\\sqrt {\\mathrm {Hz}}$ in 130-nm SiGe:C BiCMOS","volume":"53","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17524288","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239605/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"100 Gb/s Differential Linear TIAs With Less Than 10 pA/ $\\sqrt {\\mathrm {Hz}}$ in 130-nm SiGe:C BiCMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-garcialopez-2782080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100525S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"8271882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8271882","articleId":"8239605","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239608,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8239608/liu-2786662-small.gif","p":["Ming Liu received the B.Eng. degree from Zhengzhou University.

A main issue of MEC is the coordination of communication, computation, and storage. In this paper, we propose a novel MEC framework with a user virtualization scheme in the software-defined network virtualization cellular network, in which radio resources are virtualized along with computation and storage resources to cooperatively finish MEC services. Besides, we introduce the user virtualization assisted by the full-duplex communication which can extend the radio resource of wireless networks and provide the potential to increase system performance. Moreover, enabled by user virtualization, users can offload the edge computation tasks directly to the MEC server implemented at infrastructure providers or via the virtualized mobile device attributed to different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). Under this MEC framework, we formulate the virtual resource allocation as ajoint optimization problem. A distributed resource allocation algorithm based on an alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed which can reduce computational complexity and signaling overhead. We evaluate the proposed algorithm through extensive simulations, and the results show that the total utility of MVNOs can be improved significantly which benefited from user virtualization.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2786662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08239608.pdf","startPage":"2996","endPage":"3007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2786662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Duplex Aided User Virtualization for Mobile Edge Computing in 5G Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239608","topic":"Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex Aided User Virtualization for Mobile Edge Computing in 5G Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239608/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17542760","htmlLink":"/document/8239608/","volume":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016Z011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374189"},{"fundingName":"Joint Fund of the Ministry of Education of China and China Mobile","grantNumber":"MCM20160304"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Full-Duplex Aided User Virtualization for Mobile Edge Computing in 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"access-leng-2786662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123518S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Mobile Edge Computing"],"articleId":"8239608","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239622,"authors":[{"name":"Gilwon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8239622/lee-2786670-small.gif","p":["Gilwon Lee (S\u201910\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2010, 2012, and 2016, respectively.","He is currently with Prof. R.

significantly reduced amount of required channel information which is even less than that required by random beamforming.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

standards when it comes to data exchange between engineering tools in the production system automation domain. This is also reflected by the current emergence of AutomationML (AML), which uses CAEX as its core representation language. However, with the increasing use of CAEX, important language engineering challenges arise. One of these challenges is the customization of CAEX for its usage in superior standards, such as AML, which requires the precise specification of the language including the formalization and validation of additional usage rules. Another highly topical challenge is the ongoing evolution of CAEX as has recently happened with the transition from version 2.15 to version 3.0. Further challenges include the provisioning of editing facilities and visualizations of CAEX documents such that they can be inspected and modified by engineers, and the development of transformations from and to CAEX such that different engineering artifacts can be exchanged via CAEX. In this paper, we take a language engineering point of view and present a model-driven engineering (MDE) workbench for CAEX that allows to address these and other challenges.

Different approximate closed-form expressions for the stability boundary are derived revealing the effect of the parameters of the system on its dynamical behavior and showing that the stability boundary is different from the ones corresponding to single edge modulation strategies such as trailing edge and leading edge modulations. The theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations using a system-level switched model. Also, a prototype is implemented to validate he theoretical derivations and the numerical simulations getting a good matching.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2780318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8369410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2780318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8369410/08239628.pdf","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Analytical-Numerical Methodology for Predicting Subharmonic Oscillation in H-Bridge Inverters Under Double Edge Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Analytical-Numerical Methodology for Predicting Subharmonic Oscillation in H-Bridge Inverters Under Double Edge Modulation","volume":"65","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239628/","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17801685","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239628/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"DPI2013-47293-R"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002383","fundingName":"International Scientific Partnership Program ISPP, King Saud University, through ISPP","grantNumber":"00102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Analytical-Numerical Methodology for Predicting Subharmonic Oscillation in H-Bridge Inverters Under Double Edge Modulation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-aroudi-2780318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085393S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8239628","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239633,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Xu","affiliation":["School of Software, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8612980/8239633/xu-2779450-small.gif","p":["Hang Xu (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in software engineering from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology with the School of Software.","His current research interests include computational intelligence and the Internet of Things\u2019 technology and application."]},"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-3376-9487","id":"37086211564"},{"name":"Wenhua Zeng","affiliation":["School of Software, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8612980/8239633/wzeng-2779450-small.gif","p":["Wenhua Zeng received the B.S. degree in automatic control from the Nanjing Institute of Chemical Engineering, Nanjing, China, in 1983, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in automatic control from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1986 and 1989, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Software, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.

One of the most widely studied MOEAs is that based on decomposition (MOEA/D), which decomposes an MOP into a series of scalar optimization subproblems, via a set of uniformly distributed weight vectors. MOEA/D shows excellent performance on most mild MOPs, but may face difficulties on ill MOPs, with complex Pareto fronts, which are pointed, long tailed, disconnected, or degenerate. That is because the weight vectors used in decomposition are all preset and invariant. To overcome it, a new MOEA based on hierarchical decomposition (MOEA/HD) is proposed in this paper. In MOEA/HD, subproblems are layered into different hierarchies, and the search directions of lower-hierarchy subproblems are adaptively adjusted, according to the higher-hierarchy search results. In the experiments, MOEA/HD is compared with four state-of-the-art MOEAs, in terms of two widely used performance metrics. According to the empirical results, MOEA/HD shows promising performance on all the test problems.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2779450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8612980/08239633.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2779450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOEA/HD: A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Hierarchical Decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"MOEA/HD: A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Hierarchical Decomposition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239633/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18379393","pubMedId":"29990272","htmlLink":"/document/8239633/","volume":"49","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61202011 and 61272152"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"JZ160400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008865","fundingName":"Xiamen University","grantNumber":"20720170054"},{"fundingName":"European Project","grantNumber":"FP7 CFET 612146"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOEA/HD: A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Hierarchical Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zeng-2779450-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18254S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8612980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"8612980","articleId":"8239633","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239636,"authors":[{"name":"Onel L.

The numerical results corroborate the existence and uniqueness of an optimum target error probability, while showing that a relatively small battery could be a limiting factor for some setups, especially when using the energy accumulation strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08239636.pdf","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Powered Communications With Finite Battery and Finite Blocklength","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Powered Communications With Finite Battery and Finite Blocklength","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239636/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17699090","htmlLink":"/document/8239636/","volume":"66","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"CNPq"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002322","fundingName":"CAPES"},{"fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Arauc\u00e1ria (Brazil)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"303532"},{"fundingName":"Program for Graduate Students from Cooperation Agreements (PEC-PG, of CAPES/CNPq Brazil)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Powered Communications With Finite Battery and Finite Blocklength","sourcePdf":"tcomm-alcarazlopez-2786673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166992S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8239636","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239641,"authors":[{"name":"Jiankun Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of CSE, Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8612980/8239641/sun-2780625-small.gif","p":["Jiankun Sun received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Automation.","His current research interests include nonlinear control theory, disturbance estimation and compensation theory, and event-triggered control and their applications."]},"firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0002-4842-6399","id":"37085566385"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of CSE, Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8612980/8239641/yang-2780625-small.gif","p":["Jun Yang (M\u201911) received the B.Sc. degree from the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the School of Automation, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2011.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Automation, Southeast University.

By using disturbance/uncertainty estimation and attenuation technique, an event-based sampled-data composite controller is proposed together with a discrete-time extended state observer. Under the presented new framework, the newest state and disturbance estimates as well as the control signals are not transmitted via the common sensor-controller network, but instead communicated and calculated until a discrete-time event-triggering condition is violated. Compared with the periodic updates in the traditional time-triggered active disturbance rejection control, the proposed ET-ADRC scheme can remarkably reduce the communication frequency while maintaining a satisfactory closed-loop system performance. The proposed discrete-time control scheme provides the engineers with a manner of direct and easier implementation via networked digital computers. It is shown that the bounded stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. Finally, an application design example of a dc-dc buck converter with experimental results is conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed control scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2780625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8612980/08239641.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"566","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2780625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled-Data-Based Event-Triggered Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Disturbed Systems in Networked Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Sampled-Data-Based Event-Triggered Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Disturbed Systems in Networked Environment","volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8239641/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18379384","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","pubMedId":"29990275","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473080, 61573099 and 61633003"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2242016R30011 and 2242016K41067"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYLX16-0229"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Southeast University","grantNumber":"3208007702"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-Data-Based Event-Triggered Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Disturbed Systems in Networked Environment","sourcePdf":"tcyb-yang-2780625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102727S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8612980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8612980","articleId":"8239641","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239643,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Chadha","affiliation":["Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8635405/8239643/chadh-2786999-small.gif","p":["Aaron Chadha received the M.A. and M.Eng. degrees (Hons.) in information and computer engineering from the University of Cambridge.

Our approach begins with the observation that all modern video codecs divide the input frames into macroblocks (MBs). We demonstrate that selective access to MB motion vector (MV) information within compressed video bitstreams can also provide for selective, motion-adaptive, MB pixel decoding (a.k.a., MB texture decoding). This in turn allows for the derivation of spatio-temporal video activity regions at extremely high speed in comparison to conventional full-frame decoding followed by optical flow estimation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of a video classification framework based on such activity data, we independently train two CNN architectures on MB texture and MV correspondences and then fuse their scores to derive the final classification of each test video. Evaluation on two standard data sets shows that the proposed approach is competitive with the best two-stream video classification approaches found in the literature. At the same time: 1) a CPU-based realization of our MV extraction is over 977 times faster than GPU-based optical flow methods; 2) selective decoding is up to 12 times faster than full-frame decoding; and 3) our proposed spatial and temporal CNNs perform inference at 5 to 49 times lower cloud computing cost than the fastest methods from the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18433571","htmlLink":"/document/8239643/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Video Classification With CNNs: Using the Codec as a Spatio-Temporal Activity Sensor","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P02243X/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006041","fundingName":"Innovate UK","grantNumber":"132739"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000275","fundingName":"Leverhulme Trust"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000700","fundingName":"Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Classification With CNNs: Using the Codec as a Spatio-Temporal Activity Sensor","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-andreopoulos-2786999-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112281S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8635405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8635405","articleId":"8239643","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239644,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8369410/8239644/tchen-2775632-small.gif","p":["Tao Chen (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Iowa State University, Ames, USA, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","In 2014, he joined Freescale Semiconductor as an Intern focusing on ADC built-in self-test.

This paper introduces a novel method for ADC static linearity testing, allowing the stimulus linearity requirement to be significantly relaxed and the test time to be significantly reduced compared to the state-of-art histogram method. Two nonlinear but functionally related input signals are used as the ADC's excitation and a stimulus error removal technique is used to recover test accuracy. With a segmented non-parametric integral nonlinearity model, this method requires much fewer parameters to accurately represent the nonlinearity. The proposed algorithm has been extensively verified and correlated in simulations. This method not only enables low-cost production testing but can also be used for low-cost on-chip built-in self-test. This method is limited to ADCs with segmented architecture such as SAR ADCs, pipeline ADCs, and cyclic ADCs.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2775632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2775632","startPage":"2059","endPage":"2069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8369410/08239644.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8369410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"USER-SMILE: Ultrafast Stimulus Error Removal and Segmented Model Identification of Linearity Errors for ADC Built-in Self-Test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"USER-SMILE: Ultrafast Stimulus Error Removal and Segmented Model Identification of Linearity Errors for ADC Built-in Self-Test","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17801691","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239644/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"USER-SMILE: Ultrafast Stimulus Error Removal and Segmented Model Identification of Linearity Errors for ADC Built-in Self-Test","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2775632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087737S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8239644","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239646,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8906188/8239646/liu-2779564-small.gif","p":["Dong Liu received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in operational research and cybernetics from Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

However, recognizing similar actions remains challenging since previous literature fails to capture motion and shape cues effectively from noisy depth data. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, which suppresses the noise disturbances and jointly encodes both motion and shape cues. First, background clutter is removed by a background modeling method that is designed for depth data. Then, motion and shape cues are jointly used to generate robust and distinctive spatial-temporal interest points (STIPs): motion-based STIPs and shape-based STIPs. In the first layer of our model, a multiscale 3-D local steering kernel descriptor is proposed to describe local appearances of cuboids around motion-based STIPs. In the second layer, a spatial-temporal vector descriptor is proposed to describe the spatial-temporal distributions of shape-based STIPs. Using the BoVW model, motion and shape cues are combined to form a fused action representation. Our model performs favorably compared with common STIP detection and description methods. Thorough experiments verify that our model is effective in distinguishing similar actions and robust to background clutter, partial occlusions and pepper noise.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2017.2786868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2017.2786868","startPage":"1932","endPage":"1947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8411794/08239649.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8411794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust 3D Action Recognition Through Sampling Local Appearances and Global Distributions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Robust 3D Action Recognition Through Sampling Local Appearances and Global Distributions","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","volume":"20","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239649/","accessionNumber":"17954494","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239649/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61340046, 61673030 and U1613209"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015A030311034"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015B010919004"},{"fundingName":"Strategic and Prospective Industrial Development of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"ZLZBCXLJZI20160729020003"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Project of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170306164738129"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Intelligent Multimedia and Virtual Reality","grantNumber":"ZDSYS201703031405467"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust 3D Action Recognition Through Sampling Local Appearances and Global Distributions","sourcePdf":"tmm-liu-2786868-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135731S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8411794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8411794","articleId":"8239649","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239652,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Horak","affiliation":["School of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Peter Horak has receied his Ph.D. (1979) and Dr.Sc.

However, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the Beckmann random variable (RV) does not have a closed-form expression, which makes it challenging to derive analytical solutions for the outage probability of systems involving Beckmann RVs. In this paper, we study the generalized Beckmann distribution, which includes the Beckmann, Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, Hoyt, \u03ba-\u03bc, \u03b7-\u03bc, single-sided Gaussian, and the Beaulieu-Xie distributions as special cases. Three approaches are proposed to estimate the cdf of the generalized Beckmann distribution, including closed-form upper and lower cdf bounds, single-fold integration based on the closed-form characteristic function, and a left-tail cdf approximation. We compare the three approaches in terms of the ranges of applications and the computation time complexity. Based on the new cdf estimation techniques, one can efficiently evaluate the outage probabilities of pointing-error-limited FSO systems, UWOC systems, and maximum-ratio combining over arbitrarily correlated generalized Beckmann channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786665","startPage":"2235","endPage":"2250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8359223/08239659.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Distribution Function of the Generalized Beckmann Random Variable and Its Applications in Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Distribution Function of the Generalized Beckmann Random Variable and Its Applications in Communications","volume":"66","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17754506","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239659/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322112 and 61531166004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005374","fundingName":"NUPTSF","grantNumber":"NY216008"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST","grantNumber":"YESS20160042"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC Discovery Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Distribution Function of the Generalized Beckmann Random Variable and Its Applications in Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cheng-2786665-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134684S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8359223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8359223","articleId":"8239659","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239660,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xing","affiliation":["Qingdao Huituo Intelligent Machine Company, Qingdao, China","Advanced Vehicle Engineering Centre, Cranfield University, Bedford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570650/8302498/8239660/xing-2766884-small.gif","p":["Yang Xing received the B.S. degree in automatic control from the Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Shandong, China, in 2012, and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in control systems from the Department of Automatic Control and System Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2014.

It is important for an intelligent vehicle to understand driver behavior and assist in driving tasks according to their status. In this paper, the consumer range camera Kinect is used to monitor drivers and identify driving tasks in a real vehicle. Specifically, seven common tasks performed by multiple drivers during driving are identified in this paper. The tasks include normal driving, left-, right-, and rear-mirror checking, mobile phone answering, texting using a mobile phone with one or both hands, and the setup of in-vehicle video devices. The first four tasks are considered safe driving tasks, while the other three tasks are regarded as dangerous and distracting tasks. The driver behavior signals collected from the Kinect consist of a color and depth image of the driver inside the vehicle cabin. In addition, 3-D head rotation angles and the upper body (hand and arm at both sides) joint positions are recorded. Then, the importance of these features for behavior recognition is evaluated using random forests and maximal information coefficient methods. Next, a feedforward neural network (FFNN) is used to identify the seven tasks. Finally, the model performance for task recognition is evaluated with different features (body only, head only, and combined). The final detection result for the seven driving tasks among five participants achieved an average of greater than 80% accuracy, and the FFNN tasks detector is proved to be an efficient model that can be implemented for real-time driver distraction and dangerous behavior recognition.","doi":"10.1109/TCSS.2017.2766884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570650/8302498/08239660.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8302498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2017.2766884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification and Analysis of Driver Postures for In-Vehicle Driving Activities and Secondary Tasks Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Identification and Analysis of Driver Postures for In-Vehicle Driving Activities and Secondary Tasks Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239660/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17599729","htmlLink":"/document/8239660/","volume":"5","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and Analysis of Driver Postures for In-Vehicle Driving Activities and Secondary Tasks Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcss-cao-2766884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114348S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570650","isNumber":"8302498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570650","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8302498","articleId":"8239660","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239665,"authors":[{"name":"Soolmaz Abbasalizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Babol, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8402068/8239665/abbas-2783683-small.gif","p":["Soolmaz Abbasalizadeh received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Babol, Iran, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2013.

The closed-form equations, which describe the transitions of phases between the standing wave mode and the rotary traveling wave mode of the oscillator, are derived, and the delays of transitions between two modes of the oscillator are extracted by using these equations. Besides, the oscillation start-up delay is analyzed, and the closed-form equation for the start-up delay is obtained in terms of circuit elements. Finally, our theoretical results are compared with appropriate and accurate simulations to evaluate the validity of the delays analysis and the accuracy of the closed-form equations. Simulations of the dual-mode oscillator have been done in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology with a 1.8-V supply voltage.

Sorting the nonferrous metals, however, is not straightforward. Common methods range from laborious hand-sorting to expensive and environmentally deleterious wet processes. The goal is to move toward dry processes, such as induction sensors and vision systems, which can identify and sort nonferrous scrap efficiently and economically. In this paper, we present a new classification method using magnetic induction spectroscopy (MIS) to sort three high-value metals that make up the majority of the nonferrous fraction-copper, aluminum, and brass. Two approaches are investigated: the first uses MIS with a set of geometric features returned by a vision system, where metal fragments are matched to known test pieces from a training set. The second approach uses MIS only . A surprisingly effective classifier can be constructed by combining the MIS frequency components in a manner determined by how eddy currents circulate in the metal fragment. An average precision and recall (purity and recovery rate) of around 92% was shown. This has significant industrial relevance, as the MIS-only classifier is simple, scalable, and straightforward to implement on existing commercial sorting lines.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

data. Our first aim is to learn features that distinguish between the interictal and preictal regions. The second aim is to define a prediction horizon in which the prediction is as accurate and as early as possible, clearly two competing objectives. Methods: Convolutional filters on the wavelet transformation of the EEG signal are used to define and learn quantitative signatures for each period: interictal, preictal, and ictal. The optimal seizure prediction horizon is also learned from the data as opposed to making an a priori assumption. Results: Computational solutions to the optimization problem indicate a 10-min seizure prediction horizon. This result is verified by measuring Kullback-Leibler divergence on the distributions of the automatically extracted features. Conclusion: The results on the EEG database of 204 recordings demonstrate that (i) the preictal phase transition occurs approximately ten minutes before seizure onset, and (ii) the prediction results on the test set are promising, with a sensitivity of 87.8% and a low false prediction rate of 0.142 FP/h. Our results significantly outperform a random predictor and other seizure prediction algorithms. Significance: We demonstrate that a robust set of features can be learned from scalp EEG that characterize the preictal state of focal seizures.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2017.2785401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8440576/08239676.pdf","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2785401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8440576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Focal Onset Seizure Prediction Using Convolutional Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239676","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8440576/8239676-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239676/","displayDocTitle":"Focal Onset Seizure Prediction Using Convolutional Networks","volume":"65","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18041138","pubMedId":"29989952","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239676/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1302231"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Focal Onset Seizure Prediction Using Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tbme-khan-2785401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07895S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8440576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8440576","articleId":"8239676","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239683,"authors":[{"name":"Zilu Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8369410/8239683/zwang-2780826-small.gif","p":["Zilu Wang received the B.E. degree from the School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2016.

The proposed circuit mainly consists of neuron module, synapse module with synaptic weight measurement function and feedback module. Variety of learning and forgetting functions are considered. The condition of learning is that the food neuron and ring neuron are activated simultaneously. There are three types of forgetting conditions, which represent different forms of forgetting, respectively. The first (second) type of forgetting condition is that only food (ring) neuron is activated. The third type of forgetting condition is that neither food neuron nor ring neuron is activated. In addition, the rates of learning and forgetting are variable. After loops of learning and forgetting, further learning will be more skillful. In other words, the rate of learning a forgotten knowledge will be faster than before. This bionic feature is similar to human. It is implemented by changing learning and forgetting voltages by adding the feedback voltage from feedback module to them. Functions mentioned above are demonstrated by simulation results in PSPICE software.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2780826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8369410/08239683.pdf","startPage":"2210","endPage":"2220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8369410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2780826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Memristor-Based Circuit Implementation of Full-Function Pavlov Associative Memory Accorded With Biological Feature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Memristor-Based Circuit Implementation of Full-Function Pavlov Associative Memory Accorded With Biological Feature","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239683/","publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17801675","htmlLink":"/document/8239683/","volume":"65","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374150"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, HUST","grantNumber":"2017KFXKJC002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Memristor-Based Circuit Implementation of Full-Function Pavlov Associative Memory Accorded With Biological Feature","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wang-2780826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114307S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8239683","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239684,"authors":[{"name":"Lichao Mou","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany","Signal Processing in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Lichao","lastName":"Mou","id":"37076570200"},{"name":"Pedram Ghamisi","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany","Signal Processing in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Ghamisi","orcid":"0000-0003-1203-741X","id":"37085397924"},{"name":"Xiao Xiang Zhu","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany","Signal Processing in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Xiang Zhu","id":"37567672300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"8239684","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239684","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Hyperspectral imaging","Convolutional neural networks","Image classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2779459","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8271875/08239684.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"1214","endPage":"1215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8271875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2779459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corrections to \u201cDeep Recurrent Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification\u201d [Jul 17 3639-3655]","abstract":"Here, we correct some errors caused by a programming bug (a data type error) in overall accuracies (OAs) reported in \n<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"ref1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[1]</xref>\n.

Red and green QDs were sprayed onto individual region surrounded by patterned black matrix photoresist on the blue micro LEDs to form color conversion layers. Owing to its light-blocking capability, the patterned black matrix photoresist improved the contrast ratio of the micro LEDs from 11 to 22. To enhance the color conversion efficiency and the light output intensity, a hybrid Bragg reflector (HBR) was deposited on the bottom side of the monolithic RGB micro LEDs, thus reflecting the RGB light emitted to the substrate. To further improve the color purity of the red and green light, a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) with high reflection for the blue light was deposited on the top side of the QDs/micro LEDs. The red and green light output intensities of the micro LEDs with HBR and DBR were enhanced by about 27%.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2017.2786737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8249921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2017.2786737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/8249921/08239685.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic Red/Green/Blue Micro-LEDs With HBR and DBR Structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic Red/Green/Blue Micro-LEDs With HBR and DBR Structures","volume":"30","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239685/","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17454483","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239685/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, China","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221-E-006 -149-MY2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007750","fundingName":"Advanced Optoelectronic Technology Center, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic Red/Green/Blue Micro-LEDs With HBR and DBR Structures","sourcePdf":"lpt-lee-2786737-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083961S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"8249921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8249921","articleId":"8239685","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239693,"authors":[{"name":"Siyuan Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8239693/wu-2786667-small.gif","p":["Siyuan Wu received the B.Sc. degree in electronic engineering from the Guangdong University of Technology, China, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in information and communication engineering from Sun Yat-sen University, China, in 2017.

However, their decoding remains complex, preventing practical applications. Addressing the challenge, this paper proposes two interpolation-based low-complexity Chase (LCC) decoding algorithms for one of the most popular AG codes-Hermitian codes. By choosing \u03b7 unreliable symbols and realizing them with the two most likely decisions, 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03b7</sup>\n decoding test-vectors can be formulated. The first LCC algorithm performs interpolation for the common elements of the test-vectors, producing an intermediate outcome that will be shared by the uncommon element interpolation. It eliminates the redundant computation for decoding each test-vector, resulting in a low-complexity. With an interpolation multiplicity of one, the decoding is further facilitated by removing the requirement of pre-calculating the Hermitian curve's corresponding coefficients. The second LCC algorithm is an adaptive variant of the first algorithm, where the number of test-vectors is determined by the reliability of received information. When the channel condition improves, it can reduce the complexity without compromising the decoding performance. Simulation results show that the both LCC algorithms outperform a number of existing algebraic decoding algorithms for Hermitian codes. Finally, our complexity analysis will reveal the proposals' low-complexity feature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239693/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239693/","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699089","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation-Based Low-Complexity Chase Decoding Algorithms for Hermitian Codes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61671486 and 61372079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation-Based Low-Complexity Chase Decoding Algorithms for Hermitian Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-2786667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078065S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8239693","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239696,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Control Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0003-1243-4546","id":"38184486100"},{"name":"Shoulin Hao","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Control Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Shoulin","lastName":"Hao","id":"37085843635"},{"name":"Dewei Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dewei","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-0604-7518","id":"37420258500"},{"name":"Wen-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K."],"firstName":"Wen-Hua","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-3356-2889","id":"37279192700"},{"name":"Qing-Guo Wang","affiliation":["Institute for Intelligent Systems, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Qing-Guo","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-3672-3716","id":"37291367300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"8239696","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1301},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Delay effects","Observers","PD control","Uncertainty","Closed loop systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","delays","discrete time systems","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear control systems","observers","predictive control","robust control","temperature control","time-varying systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictor-based disturbance rejection control scheme","discrete-time domain","unstable processes","extended state observer","deterministic system state","generalized disturbance","system uncertainties","external disturbance","filtered Smith predictor","delay-free output response","closed-loop control system","ESO gain vector","PDRC controller","output predictor","closed-loop system","temperature control system","control method","sampled systems","input delay","industrial system operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dead-time compensator (DTC)","disturbance rejection control (DRC)","extended state observer (ESO)","input delay","robust stability","sampled control systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239696","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2017.2781651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2017.2781651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8633581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/8633581/08239696.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictor-Based Disturbance Rejection Control for Sampled Systems With Input Delay","abstract":"To cope with input delay involved with many industrial system operations, a predictor-based disturbance rejection control (PDRC) scheme is proposed in discrete-time domain for sampling implementation, which can be generally applied for open-loop stable, integrating, and unstable processes. An extended state observer (ESO) is introduced to estimate not only the deterministic system state but also the generalized disturbance composed of system uncertainties and external disturbance, based on a filtered Smith predictor to estimate the delay-free output response. Correspondingly, by specifying the desired poles of ESO and the closed-loop control system, the ESO gain vector and the PDRC controller are analytically derived. A notable merit is that there is a single tuning parameter in the proposed ESO, output predictor, and the PDRC controller, which can be monotonically tuned to achieve a good tradeoff between the prediction (or control) performance and its robustness. A sufficient robust stability condition of the closed-loop system is established in terms of linear matrix inequality. An illustrative example from the literature along with an application to the temperature control system for a crystallization reactor is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed control method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239696/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18416287","volume":"27","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predictor-Based Disturbance Rejection Control for Sampled Systems With Input Delay","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61633006 and 61473054"},{"fundingName":"National Thousand Talents Program of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictor-Based Disturbance Rejection Control for Sampled Systems With Input Delay","sourcePdf":"tcst-liu-2781651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101351S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8633581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8633581","articleId":"8239696","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239697,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Costa","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8354843/8239697/costa-2779801-small.gif","p":["Filippo Costa (S\u201907\u2013M\u201911) received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering and Ph.D. degree in applied electromagnetism from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","In 2009, he was a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland.

The procedure takes advantage from the known tag movement to improve the tag detection capability by integrating several received signals. The implicit advantage of the proposed detection scheme is that the background measurement, collected in the absence of the tag, can be easily performed before the tag passes in front of the reader antenna. The reading procedure allows for a significant increase of the interrogation distance and, more importantly, it greatly improves the detection probability in complex scenarios, where the tag is attached on arbitrary and highly scattering objects. A simplified model is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the presented procedure in detecting tags even in the presence of high clutter. Detection of tags with signal-to-noise ratio as low as -10 dB is experimentally demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2017.2779801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8354843/08239697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2017.2779801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8354843","startPage":"2442","endPage":"2451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Reading Approach for Moving Chipless RFID Tags by Using ISAR Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Reading Approach for Moving Chipless RFID Tags by Using ISAR Processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17736219","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239697/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010686","fundingName":"EMERGENT","grantNumber":"645771"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Reading Approach for Moving Chipless RFID Tags by Using ISAR Processing","sourcePdf":"tmtt-costa-2779801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118461S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8354843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8354843","articleId":"8239697","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8239704,"authors":[{"name":"Wonseok Jeon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Wonseok Jeon (S\u201914\u2013M\u201917) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2017.

Our aim is to jointly design RRH selection and beamforming vectors such that the minimum weighted data rate among users is maximized under the constraints of maximum transmit power and fronthaul capacity at each specific RRH. The problem is intractable due to the numerical difficulties of combination and nonconvex functions. Based on a semidefinite relaxation technique, bisection search, and a branch-and-bound method, we develop an upper bound, which is also the optimal solution to the original problem if the relaxation is tight. More importantly, we propose a heuristic low-complexity iterative procedure for practical applications based on the state-of-the-art sequential convex approximation. Subsequently, we modify the proposed methods for the uncertain channel state information case. To be specific, the upper bound and its suboptimal solution are altered based on the S-lemma while the low-complexity algorithm is tailored by using two different approximations of intractable robust counterpart. The validity of the proposed methods in the region of limited fronthaul capacity is confirmed by numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08239708.pdf","startPage":"1534","endPage":"1548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2786664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Max\u2013Min Fairness for C-RAN Multicasting Under Limited Fronthaul Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Max\u2013Min Fairness for C-RAN Multicasting Under Limited Fronthaul Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239708/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17699091","htmlLink":"/document/8239708/","volume":"66","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"\u201cWireless Connectivity for Internet of Everything \u2013 Energy Efficient Transceiver and System Design (WiConIE)\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"297803"},{"fundingName":"\u201cFlexible Uplink-Downlink Resource Management for Energy and Spectral Efficiency Enhancing in Future Wireless Networks (FURMESFuN)\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"31089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Max\u2013Min Fairness for C-RAN Multicasting Under Limited Fronthaul Constraints","sourcePdf":"tcomm-vu-2786664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153014S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8239708","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239709,"authors":[{"name":"Lauri Perkki\u00f6","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Perkki\u00f6","orcid":"0000-0003-0857-6912","id":"37085488377"},{"name":"Brijesh Upadhaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Brijesh","lastName":"Upadhaya","orcid":"0000-0002-0538-5566","id":"37086294602"},{"name":"Antti Hannukainen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Hannukainen","id":"38468010000"},{"name":"Paavo Rasilo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland","Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Paavo","lastName":"Rasilo","orcid":"0000-0002-0721-5800","id":"37541505400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"8239709","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Finite element analysis","Magnetic hysteresis","Convergence","Numerical models","Electrical engineering","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","finite element analysis","induction motors","machine theory","magnetic hysteresis","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical machines","nonlinear field equation","induction motor","numerical convergence problems","time-stepping finite-element analysis","Jiles-Atherton magnetic hysteresis model","stable adaptive method","quasiNewton method","coupled problem","stable time integration scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-element method (FEM)","Jiles\u2013Atherton (JA)","numerical methods","quasi-Newton (QN)"]}],"abstract":"The Jiles-Atherton magnetic hysteresis model coupled with time-stepping finite-element analysis is reported to suffer from numerical convergence problems, for example, when simulating electrical machines.

Solutions addressing this challenge should consider the sharing of memory pages among virtual machines (VMs) and the available capacity of each type of requested resources. We provide such solution by designing a greedy approximation algorithm for solving the sharing-aware virtual machine revenue maximization (SAVMRM) problem. The SAVMRM problem requires determining the set of VMs that can be instantiated on a given server such that the revenue derived from hosting the VMs is maximized. In addition, we model the SAVMRM problem as a multilinear binary program and optimally solve it, while accounting for page sharing and multiple resource constraints. We determine and analyze the approximability properties of our proposed greedy algorithm and evaluate it by performing extensive experiments using Google cluster workload traces. The experimental results show that under various scenarios, our proposed algorithm generates higher revenue than other VM allocation algorithms while achieving significant reduction of allocated memory.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2017.2786728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/9346133/08239710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9346133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2017.2786728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approximation Algorithm for Sharing-Aware Virtual Machine Revenue Maximization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Approximation Algorithm for Sharing-Aware Virtual Machine Revenue Maximization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239710/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2021","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"20415602","htmlLink":"/document/8239710/","volume":"14","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DGE-0654014 and CNS-1116787"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approximation Algorithm for Sharing-Aware Virtual Machine Revenue Maximization","sourcePdf":"tsc-grosu-2786728-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267953S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"9346133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9346133","articleId":"8239710","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239714,"authors":[{"name":"Keji Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7433297/8363123/8239714/zheng-2778716-small.gif","p":["Keji Zheng received the Master's degree in computer science from Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand, in 2017.

DNNs are suitable for dealing with the problems related to time series, such as speech recognition and natural language processing. Video dynamics detection, for instance, is time dependent. Apparently, video dynamics detection needs to utilize the present, previous, and next frames of a given video. If a frame change occurs, it triggers whether a video event happens or not. In this paper, video dynamics detection based on deep learning is implemented and our contributions are to effectively improve the accuracy of video dynamics detection. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) increasing the accuracy rate to 96% compared to an FSM-based video dynamics detection in real time; 2) By combining convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network (RNN) together, the training time is greatly reduced as we expected.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433297/8363123/08239714.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Dynamics Detection Using Deep Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TETCI.2017.2778716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8363123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETCI.2017.2778716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Video Dynamics Detection Using Deep Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17829406","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8239714/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Dynamics Detection Using Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tetci-yan-2778716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114374S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7433297","isNumber":"8363123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7433297","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8363123","articleId":"8239714","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239743,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Min","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8239722/8239743/min-2756989-small.gif","p":["Weidong Min received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in computer application from Tsinghua University, China, in 1989, 1991 and 1995, respectively, on the research subjects of computer graphics, image processing, and computer aided geometric design.

Due to complicated traffic environments it is difficult to track multiple vehicles accurately and robustly, especially when there are occlusions among vehicles. To alleviate these problems, a new approach is proposed to track multiple vehicles with the combination of robust detection and two classifiers. An improved ViBe algorithm is proposed for robust and accurate detection of multiple vehicles. It uses the gray-scale spatial information to build dictionary of pixel life length to make ghost shadows and object's residual shadows quickly blended into the samples of the background. The improved algorithm takes good post-processing method to restrain dynamic noise. In this paper, we also design a method using two classifiers to further attack the problem of failure to track vehicles with occlusions and interference. It classifies tracking rectangles with confidence values between two thresholds through combining local binary pattern with support vector machine (SVM) classifier and then using a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for the second time to remove the interference areas between vehicles and other moving objects. The two classifiers method has both time efficiency advantage of SVM and high accuracy advantage of CNN. Comparing with several existing methods, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of our experiment results showed that the proposed method not only effectively removed the ghost shadows, and improved the detection accuracy and real-time performance, but also was robust to deal with the occlusion of multiple vehicles in various traffic scenes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17482738","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239743/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach to Track Multiple Vehicles With the Combination of Robust Detection and Two Classifiers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61762061 and 61662044"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004479","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, China","grantNumber":"20161ACB20004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach to Track Multiple Vehicles With the Combination of Robust Detection and Two Classifiers","sourcePdf":"tits-min-2756989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125907S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8239722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8239722","articleId":"8239743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8239783,"authors":[{"name":"Xenofon Fafoutis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8239783/fafou-2787418-small.gif","p":["Xenofon Fafoutis (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in informatics and telecommunications from the University of Athens in 2007, the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Crete in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in embedded systems engineering from the Technical University of Denmark in 2014.

Specifically, we prove that the detection performance of a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), where the unknown transmit power is estimated, is identical to that of a differential likelihood ratio test (D-LRT). Our analysis also proves the asymptotic optimality of D-LRT for an RSS-based LVS with unknown transmit power. These results are important for real-world deployments of LVSs, since D-LRT incurs a significantly lower implementation cost relative to GLRT.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2787129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2787129","startPage":"650","endPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8309483/08239790.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location Verification Systems Based on Received Signal Strength With Unknown Transmit Power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Location Verification Systems Based on Received Signal Strength With Unknown Transmit Power","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17614445","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239790/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP150103905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location Verification Systems Based on Received Signal Strength With Unknown Transmit Power","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yan-2787129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081008S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8309483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8309483","articleId":"8239790","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239792,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Sheikh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Sheikh (S\u201915) was born in Mashhad, Iran, in 1989.

The differences in temperature dependent shifts among cells bring challenge to the reliability of analog or multilevel resistive switching behavior, namely thermal instability, which is characterized by the temperature coefficient (T\u03b1) of RRAM. Its effect on RRAM performances was studied by pulse programming and retention measurement. Through atomistic simulation, this letter showed that thermal instability of cells with a positive T\u03b1 was related to the arrangement of oxygen vacancy inside the switching layer. Based on this model, the probability of cells with a positive T\u03b1 was found to be effectively reduced by introducing a baking process which led to an overall improvement of retention for the 1 k

By training with the 2000 challenge training images, our method achieved an average Jaccard Index of 0.765 on the 600 challenge testing images, which ranked itself in the first place among 21 final submissions in the challenge.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Dermoscopic Image Segmentation With Enhanced Convolutional-Deconvolutional Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2017.2787487","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8660593/08239798.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2787487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8660593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Improving Dermoscopic Image Segmentation With Enhanced Convolutional-Deconvolutional Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8239798/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2019","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18630092","pubMedId":"29990146","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Dermoscopic Image Segmentation With Enhanced Convolutional-Deconvolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"jbhi-yuan-2787487-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078025S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8660593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8660593","articleId":"8239798","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239802,"authors":[{"name":"Bal\u00e1zs Matuz","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), We\u00dfling, Germany"],"firstName":"Bal\u00e1zs","lastName":"Matuz","orcid":"0000-0002-0133-6564","id":"37392269300"},{"name":"Gianluigi Liva","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), We\u00dfling, Germany"],"firstName":"Gianluigi","lastName":"Liva","orcid":"0000-0001-8657-2963","id":"37392271200"},{"name":"Enrico Paolini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy","CNIT, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Paolini","orcid":"0000-0003-0781-531X","id":"37392092900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8239802","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","AWGN channels","Binary phase shift keying","Generators","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short nonbinary maximum distance separable cycle codes","regular graph","short messages","low code rates","inner binary code","maximum-likelihood decoding","efficient soft-decision decoding","admissible field order","explicit construction method","finite field orders","MDS cycle codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation","codes on graphs","coherent and non-coherent detection","concatenated codes","cycle codes","low-density parity-check codes","maximum distance separable codes"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a class of very short nonbinary cycle codes that are maximum distance separable (MDS).

Interference alignment (IA), as a novel interference management scheme to break through the traditional interference cancelation, not only makes the complete mitigation of interference possible but also achieves a theoretical breakthrough in promoting the wireless network capacity region. In this paper, by combining the space and time, we proposed a linear space-time (LST) IA algorithm based on the extension of the channel in time dimension for K-user multi-input multi-output interference channel. The proposed LST-IA scheme effectively reduces the number of antennas required for eliminating interference completely in systems, and the closed-form solution of precoding matrices and detector matrices is obtained as well. Compared with the classical IA algorithms, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme shows distinguished advantages in terms of sum-rate and bit error rate in the strong interference communication scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08239809.pdf","startPage":"3085","endPage":"3095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Space-Time Interference Alignment for $K$ -User MIMO Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239809","topic":"Recent Advances on Radio Access and Security Methods in 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239809/","displayDocTitle":"Linear Space-Time Interference Alignment for $K$ -User MIMO Interference Channels","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542767","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8239809/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Special Project of China","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001010-004"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT16R72"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501072"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology","grantNumber":"cstc2015jcyjA40040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Linear Space-Time Interference Alignment for $K$ -User MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"access-jing-2787153-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091311S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Recent Advances on Radio Access and Security Methods in 5G Networks"],"articleId":"8239809","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239811,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Abbasnejad","affiliation":["Design, Verification and Debugging of Embedded Systems Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8277082/8239811/abbas-2787339-small.gif","p":["Mojtaba Abbasnejad received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz, Iran.

Despite their major role in modern monitoring systems, there have been a few works about the challenges of data acquisition and data analysis in such systems. These sensors have a sensing distance of tens of kilometers, which result in a massive amount of raw data. To process this amount of data, millions of operations are needed, which can be quite challenging in an online monitoring system. In this paper, we propose a hardware architecture for analysis of acquired data from the optical part of these sensors. Our main focus is on the performance and utilization of field programmable gate array resources.

The NOMA system model consists of the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as a pulse shaping technique in conjunction with a variable power domain for various users, allocated in proportion to each user's channel gain. OFDM technique based on wavelet filter banks, namely wavelet OFDM (WOFDM) has been utilized in digital communication to improve the system robustness to noise and adjacent channel interference, and is therefore anticipated to be adopted for the NOMA technique. WOFDM in NOMA (WNOMA) outperforms OFDM-based conventional NOMA (CNOMA) with reference to interference mitigation, bandwidth efficiency, spectral confinement, and multi-user capacity. Most of the fourth generation (4G) networks are based on OFDM and its variants. Therefore, in this paper, keeping in view the interoperability with the 4G networks and the latency requirements in 5G, a dual physical layer based on conventional OFDM and WOFDM as pulse shaping methods, is proposed for the NOMA transceiver. Performance of WNOMA and CNOMA is analyzed for bit error rate in the presence of channel impairments including additive noise and IQ imbalance and multiuser capacity is also computed. Comparison of various parameters indicates the advantage of adopting WNOMA over its conventional counterpart for relatively poor channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2787200","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Framework","abstract":"Chromatic derivatives are special, numerically robust differential operators that preserve spectral features of a signal; the associated chromatic approximations accurately capture local features of a signal. For this reason they allow digital processing of continuous time signals often superior to processing of discrete samples of such signals. We introduce a new concept of \u201cmatched filter\u201d chromatic approximations, where the underlying basis functions are chosen to match the spectral profile of the signals being approximated. We then derive a collection of formulas and theorems that form a general framework for practical applications of chromatic derivatives and approximations. In the second part of this paper, we use such a general framework in several case studies of such applications that aim to illustrate how chromatic derivatives and approximations can be used in signal processing with an intention of motivating DSP engineers to find applications of these novel concepts in their own practice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239824/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17573557","volume":"66","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Chromatic Derivatives and Approximations in Practice\u2014Part I: A General Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chromatic Derivatives and Approximations in Practice\u2014Part I: A General Framework","sourcePdf":"tsp-ignjatovic-2787127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122675S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8277098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8277098","articleId":"8239824","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239825,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Windsor, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-9764-8748","id":"37404613000"},{"name":"T.

They degrade the system reliability significantly. Existing solutions to soft errors either incur unaffordable area and power overheads or fail to provide resilience against multiple-cell-upsets. We present the first low-cost, compiler-based approach Aster to handle multi-bit soft errors. Aster relies on acoustic wave detectors to detect soft errors, and uses idempotent processing and checkpointing to provide a complete solution to multi-bit soft errors. Aster comes into action when a soft error is detected. Based upon the information about the error location, Aster determines the impact of the error on the program correctness. The program continues to execute in case of no impact. Otherwise, it finds an optimal idempotent region which can recover the program from the error completely, and executes the program from the optimal idempotent region. Experimental results show that the time overhead is within 5 percent, approximately 60 percent reduction compared to the state-of-the-art schemes requiring expensive hardware support.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2017.2787107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/9280460/08239828.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2017.2787107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9280460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aster: Multi-Bit Soft Error Recovery Using Idempotent Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Aster: Multi-Bit Soft Error Recovery Using Idempotent Processing","volume":"8","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2020","accessionNumber":"20261733","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2020","htmlLink":"/document/8239828/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239828/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2020","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aster: Multi-Bit Soft Error Recovery Using Idempotent Processing","sourcePdf":"tetc-naveed-2787107-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093907S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"9280460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","xplore-issue":"9280460","articleId":"8239828","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239831,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Bernardini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Bernardini","orcid":"0000-0001-7973-0134","id":"37085407782"},{"name":"Fabio Antonacci","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Antonacci","id":"37391573500"},{"name":"Augusto Sarti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Sarti","orcid":"0000-0002-5803-1702","id":"37273801600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8239831","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Time-domain analysis","Microphone arrays","Array signal processing","Sensors","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","delays","microphone arrays","multiplying circuits","time-domain analysis","wave digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust first-order differential microphone arrays","wave digital filters","physical microphones","time-domain methods","DMA","time-varying beampatterns","beamforming method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","differential microphone arrays (DMAs)","wave digital filters (WDFs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239831","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2787484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","abstract":"In this letter, a novel time-domain implementation of robust first-order differential microphone arrays (DMAs), based on wave digital filters, is presented.

The design problem is formulated into a maximization of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), including various constraints on the transmit waveforms. Compared with the traditional alternating semidefinite relaxation approach, a general and flexible algorithm is proposed based on the majorization-minimization method with guaranteed monotonicity, lower computational complexity per iteration and/or convergence to a B-stationary point. Many waveform constraints can be flexibly incorporated into the algorithm with only a few modifications. Furthermore, the connection between the proposed algorithm and the alternating optimization approach is revealed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated via numerical experiments in terms of SINR performance, ambiguity function, computational time, and properties of the designed waveforms. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithms are faster in terms of running time and meanwhile achieve as good SINR performance as the the existing methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for MIMO Radar With Multiple Waveform Constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2787115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8277098/08239836.pdf","startPage":"1526","endPage":"1540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2787115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8277098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for MIMO Radar With Multiple Waveform Constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8239836/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17573551","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC","grantNumber":"16206315"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong RGC Theme-based Research Scheme (TRS)","grantNumber":"T21-602/15R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Waveform/Receive Filter Design for MIMO Radar With Multiple Waveform Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-wu-2787115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121237S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8277098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8277098","articleId":"8239836","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239840,"authors":[{"name":"Shalini Pal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8306207/8239840/pal-2787121-small.gif","p":["Shalini Pal (S\u201916) received the M.Tech. degree in power\n electronics and drives from the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, India, in 2013.

This paper presents a detailed structure of a household user, which is capable of energy transactions among consumer and load-serving entity. The proposed household model comprises several assets including nonshiftable appliances, shiftable appliances, and electric vehicle (EV). The EV can further contribute to the vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid type of connections that can reduce the household electricity payments with their bilateral energy transactions. The day-ahead dynamic prices are superimposed with peak power limiting approach to prevent the formation of new peaks.

The central concept of the proposed methods stems from the adaptive array theory. More precisely, it is found that the inverse of the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix in adaptive beamforming can be regarded as a linear combination of two orthogonal projection matrices, and, accordingly, the optimal weight vector is a linear combination of two orthogonal vectors. With such an observation, the WORD scheme is developed to design the desired weight vector. It is shown that the array response at a given direction can be precisely adjusted to an arbitrary level, by simply determining appropriate combination coefficients for those two orthogonal vectors. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of the weight vector can be achieved by introducing a new cost function that measures pattern variation. By employing the WORD scheme successively, a novel approach to pattern synthesis for arbitrary arrays is devised. At each implementation step of this approach, the array pattern is adjusted in a point-by-point manner by successively modifying the weight vector. As such, both the sidelobe and mainlobe regions can be flexibly synthesized. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the WORD scheme in array response control at a single direction as well as pattern synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2787143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08239844.pdf","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2787143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Pattern Synthesis for Arbitrary Arrays via Weight Vector Orthogonal Decomposition","volume":"66","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8239844/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17524203","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239844/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671139, 61771316 and 61701499"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of the Department of Education of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016KTSCX125"},{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2017A030313341"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern Synthesis for Arbitrary Arrays via Weight Vector Orthogonal Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2787143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083887S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8239844","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":8239852,"authors":[{"name":"Heegon Kim","affiliation":["EMC Lab, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Heegon","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0003-0728-1346","id":"37858628100"},{"name":"Chunchun Sui","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chunchun","lastName":"Sui","orcid":"0000-0003-1950-4236","id":"37085386399"},{"name":"Kevin Cai","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Cai","orcid":"0000-0002-1550-6640","id":"37086125593"},{"name":"Bidyut Sen","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bidyut","lastName":"Sen","id":"37346241600"},{"name":"Jun Fan","affiliation":["EMC Lab, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Fan","orcid":"0000-0001-5674-033X","id":"37271216200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"8239852","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1062},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Data models","Numerical models","Genetic algorithms","Training data","Transmission line matrix methods","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","neural nets","telecommunication computing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization technique","precise high-speed channel modeling","machine learning algorithms","optimal channel design","minimum channel loss","crosstalk","fast high-speed channel modeling","RLGC matrices","resistance-inductance-conductance-and-capacitance matrices","design-of-experiment method","artificial neural network","genetic algorithm","frequency 20 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network (ANN)","channel modeling and optimization","genetic algorithm (GA)","Latin-hypercube sampling (LHS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239852","abstract":"This letter proposes a fast and precise high-speed channel modeling and optimization technique based on machine learning algorithms.

However, how to allocate the limited caching resources with secure content delivery becomes a new challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel theoretical model to deliver secure content with edge nodes in order to save energy for green cities. First, we present a reverse auction game to encourage edge nodes to cooperatively provide caching services with incentives. With the model, mobile users can determine the candidate of edge node to cache content based on the interaction between mobile users and edge nodes. Second, a trust management method is designed to evaluate the reliability of the selected candidate of edge node by considering the direct trust evaluation. Finally, extensive simulations show that the proposal can save energy with a secure content delivery where both the delay to obtain the content and the caching ratio can be improved compared with the conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2787201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2787201","startPage":"2550","endPage":"2559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8371343/08239854.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8371343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Content Delivery With Edge Nodes to Save Caching Resources for Mobile Users in Green Cities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Secure Content Delivery With Edge Nodes to Save Caching Resources for Mobile Users in Green Cities","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17806926","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239854/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"The Fundamental Theory and Applications of Big Data with Knowledge Engineering"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1000903"},{"fundingName":"MOE Innovation Research Team","grantNumber":"IRT17R86"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91746114, 61571286, 61721002 and 61502379"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Content Delivery With Edge Nodes to Save Caching Resources for Mobile Users in Green Cities","sourcePdf":"tii-su-2787201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110242S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8371343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8371343","articleId":"8239854","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8239856,"authors":[{"name":"Min Xiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8277098/8239856/xiang-2787102-small.gif","p":["Min Xiang (M\u201917) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from\n Beihang University, Beijing, China.

This causes difficulties in both understanding their behavior and designing optimal filters. Based on a thorough exploration of the augmented statistics of quaternion random vectors, this paper extends an analysis framework for real-valued adaptive filters to the mean and mean square convergence analyses of general quaternion adaptive filters in nonstationary environments. The extension is nontrivial, considering the noncommutative quaternion algebra, only recently resolved issues with quaternion gradient, and the multidimensional augmented quaternion statistics. Also, for rigor, in order to model a nonstationary environment, the system weights are assumed to vary according to a first-order random-walk model. Transient and steady-state performance of a general class of quaternion adaptive filters is provided by exploiting the augmented quaternion statistics. An innovative quaternion decorrelation technique allows us to develop intuitive closed-form expressions for the performance of quaternion least mean square (QLMS) filters with Gaussian inputs, which provide new insights into the relationship between the filter behavior and the complete second-order statistics of the input signal, that is, quaternion noncircularity. The closed-form expressions for the performance of strictly linear, semiwidely linear, and widely linear QLMS filters are investigated in detail, while numerical simulations for the three classes of QLMS filters with correlated Gaussian inputs support the theoretical analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8277098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2787102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8277098/08239856.pdf","startPage":"1566","endPage":"1579","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2787102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Adaptive Filters in Nonstationary Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Adaptive Filters in Nonstationary Environments","volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8239856/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17573548","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Quaternion-Valued Adaptive Filters in Nonstationary Environments","sourcePdf":"tsp-xiang-2787102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112783S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8277098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8277098","articleId":"8239856","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239858,"authors":[{"name":"Niras C.

An RNS represents large integer numbers as a smaller integer set, or residues of a modulo set, without carry propagation between them. Hence mathematical operations, such as addition or subtraction, can be performed on the residues independently. This paper proposes an RNS implementation of motion estimation for the latest video coding standard known as high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) or H.265. Since motion estimation is the most computationally intensive task in video coding, several simplified algorithms are proposed for mitigating the problem, but the majority of them result in a worsening peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or bit-rate performance, or sometimes both. This paper also proposes a modified algorithm based on a test-zone (TZ) search algorithm, a widely used fast-search algorithm with good rate-distortion performance, suitable for hardware implementation for encoding ultra-high-definition videos in real time. The results show that worst-case PSNR degradation and bit-rate increases compared with the TZ search in the HEVC reference software implementation are negligible, and the hardware gate count is less than for many other designs in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2787194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8635405/08239858.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2787194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8635405","startPage":"572","endPage":"581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Residue Number System Hardware Design of Fast-Search Variable-Motion-Estimation Accelerator for HEVC/H.265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Residue Number System Hardware Design of Fast-Search Variable-Motion-Estimation Accelerator for HEVC/H.265","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18433573","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8239858/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Residue Number System Hardware Design of Fast-Search Variable-Motion-Estimation Accelerator for HEVC/H.265","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-cheeckottuvayalil-2787194-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118369S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8635405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8635405","articleId":"8239858","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8239860,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Wu","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute USC, Marina del Rey, CA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085784197"},{"name":"Tal Hassner","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute USC, Marina del Rey, CA"],"firstName":"Tal","lastName":"Hassner","orcid":"0000-0003-2275-1406","id":"37393684300"},{"name":"Kanggeon Kim","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems USC, Marina del Rey, CA"],"firstName":"Kanggeon","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-9467-2323","id":"37086190049"},{"name":"G\u00e9rard Medioni","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems USC, Marina del Rey, CA"],"firstName":"G\u00e9rard","lastName":"Medioni","id":"37280043300"},{"name":"Prem Natarajan","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute USC, Marina del Rey, CA"],"firstName":"Prem","lastName":"Natarajan","id":"37085788084"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"8239860","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2735},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial Landmark Detection with Tweaked Convolutional Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8520726/08239860.pdf","startPage":"3067","endPage":"3074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2787130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8520726","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2787130","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Magnetic heads","Training data","Gesture recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","face recognition","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial properties","facial landmark coordinates","specific poses","sufficient training examples","specialized sub-networks","facial landmark detection","tweaked convolutional neural networks","face images","tweaked CNN architecture","profile poses","AFW","ALFW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face and gesture recognition","Neural nets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239860","abstract":"This paper concerns the problem of facial landmark detection.

Based on this finding, we describe a novel CNN architecture, specialized to regress the facial landmark coordinates of faces in specific poses and appearances. To address the shortage of training data, particularly in extreme profile poses, we additionally present data augmentation techniques designed to provide sufficient training examples for each of these specialized sub-networks.

The waveform design is based on the minimization of the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and weighted ISL (WISL) of waveforms. As the corresponding problems can quickly grow to a large scale with increasing the code length and the number of waveforms, the main issue turns to be the development of fast large-scale optimization techniques. The difficulty is also that the corresponding optimization problems are nonconvex, but the required accuracy is high. Therefore, we formulate the ISL and WISL minimization problems as nonconvex quartic optimization problems in frequency domain, and then simplify them into quadratic problems via majorization-minimization technique, which is one of the basic techniques for addressing large-scale and/or nonconvex optimization problems. While designing our fast algorithms, we explore and use the inherent algebraic structures in objective functions to rewrite them into quartic forms, and in the case of WISL minimization, to derive additionally an alternative quartic form that allows us to apply the quartic-quadratic transformation. Our algorithms are applicable to large-scale unimodular waveform design problems as they are proved to have lower or comparable computational burden (analyzed theoretically) and faster convergence speed (confirmed by comprehensive simulations) than the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, the waveforms designed by our algorithms demonstrate better correlation properties compared to their counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2787104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8269342/08239862.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2787104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Algorithms for Designing Unimodular Waveform(s) With Good Correlation Properties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fast Algorithms for Designing Unimodular Waveform(s) With Good Correlation Properties","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239862/","volume":"66","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8239862/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 March1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17524207","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland Research","grantNumber":"299243"},{"fundingName":"Nokia Foundation","grantNumber":"201710358"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Algorithms for Designing Unimodular Waveform(s) With Good Correlation Properties","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2787104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116099S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8269342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8269342","articleId":"8239862","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8239866,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Ignjatovi\u0107","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Aleksandar Ignjatovi\u0107, photograph and biography not available at the time of\n publication."]},"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Ignjatovi\u0107","orcid":"0000-0001-7427-4934","id":"37326895100"},{"name":"Chamith Wijenayake","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Chamith Wijenayake, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication.\n"]},"firstName":"Chamith","lastName":"Wijenayake","orcid":"0000-0002-2070-1010","id":"37541150700"},{"name":"Gabriele Keller","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Gabriele Keller, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Keller","id":"37086293827"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"8239866","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Chromatic derivatives are special, numerically robust differential operators that preserve spectral features of a signal; the associated chromatic approximations accurately capture local features of a signal.

We present four case studies: a highly accurate (better than 170 dB) reconstruction of a signal from its nonuniformly spaced samples; a highly accurate method for obtaining timing information, such as timing of the zeros of a signal as well as timing of the zeros of its first derivative; a method of reconstruction of a sampled speech signal of 64 000 samples using such timing information only, with a reconstruction error of only about 1% of the rms of the original signal; and finally, a denoising algorithm that significantly outperforms the well-known Cadzow's denoising algorithm. The main purpose of these case studies is to illustrate the potential of chromatic derivatives and expansions and motivate DSP engineers to find applications of these novel concepts in their own practice.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation error","Signal processing algorithms","Timing","Noise reduction","Signal to noise ratio","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","signal denoising","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromatic derivatives","zero-crossings reconstruction","associated chromatic approximations","signal denoising","numerically robust differential operators","nonuniform sampling","timing information","noise figure 170.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chromatic derivatives","chromatic expansions","non-uniform sampling","interpolation","zero crossings reconstruction","denoising","digital processing of continuous time signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2787149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8277098/08239866.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8277098","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2787149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chromatic Derivatives and Approximations in Practice\u2014Part II: Nonuniform Sampling, Zero-Crossings Reconstruction, and Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Chromatic Derivatives and Approximations in Practice\u2014Part II: Nonuniform Sampling, Zero-Crossings Reconstruction, and Denoising","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239866/","volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"15 March15, 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8239866/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17573553","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15, 15 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chromatic Derivatives and Approximations in Practice\u2014Part II: Nonuniform Sampling, Zero-Crossings Reconstruction, and Denoising","sourcePdf":"tsp-ignjatovic-2787149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067814S","chronDate":"March15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8277098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8277098","articleId":"8239866","onlineDate":"25 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8239924,"authors":[{"name":"Len Bass","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University's"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/52/8239922/8239924/8239924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["LEN BASS is an adjunct faculty member for Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Software Engineering program.

A large number of research efforts have focused on intrusion detection in industrial networks; however, few of them discuss what to do after an intrusion has been detected. Because the safety of most of these control systems is time sensitive, we need new research on automatic incident response. This article shows how software-defined networks and network function virtualization can facilitate automatic incident response to a variety of attacks against industrial networks. It also presents a prototype of an incident-response solution that detects and responds automatically to sensor attacks and controller attacks. This work shows the promise that cloud-enabled software-defined networks and virtual infrastructures hold as a way to provide novel defense-in-depth solutions for industrial systems.

However, this complexity leads to a wide attack surface posing security risks and vulnerabilities.

Dynamically mitigating threat potential in the presence of unknown vulnerabilities requires an adaptive risk-based scheme to assess the system's state, a secure system architecture that can isolate hardware and software components, and design methods that can adaptively adjust the system's topology based on risk changes. The essential complementary aspects during deployment are detecting, characterizing, and quantifying security threats.

However, all private data are then pushed to these remote \u201cswamps,\u201d and human users lose actual control as compared to when the applications are executed directly on their devices. At the same time, computing at the network edge is still lacking support for such straightforward multidevice development, which is essential for a wide range of dynamic cyber-physical services. This article proposes a novel programming model as well as contributes the associated secure-connectivity framework for leveraging safe coordinated device proximity as an additional degree of freedom between the remote cloud and the safety-critical network edge, especially under uncertain environment constraints. This article is part of a special issue on Software Safety and Security Risk Mitigation in Cyber-physical Systems.","doi":"10.1109/MS.2017.4541037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Software","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Software","pdfPath":"/iel7/52/8239922/08239948.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2017.4541037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8239922","startPage":"30","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safe, Secure Executions at the Network Edge: Coordinating Cloud, Edge, and Fog Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8239948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Safe, Secure Executions at the Network Edge: Coordinating Cloud, Edge, and Fog Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"January/February  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8239948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January/February 2018","accessionNumber":"17482475","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8239948/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Safe, Secure Executions at the Network Edge: Coordinating Cloud, Edge, and Fog Computing","sourcePdf":"mso2018010030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063953S","chronDate":"January/February  2018","xplore-pub-id":"52","isNumber":"8239922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8239922","articleId":"8239948","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"}]
