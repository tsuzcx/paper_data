Actually there are four separate configurations: 1) voltage sensed at output and voltage returned to input, 2) voltage sensed at output and current returned to input, 3) current sensed at output and voltage returned to input, and 4) current sensed at output and current returned to input. Also, if we examine the amplifier around which such feedback is utilized, we see the existence of four ideal transfer functions: 1) voltage amplifier, 2) current amplifier, 3) transimpedance amplifier, and 4) transadmittance amplifier. If we consider the employment of each of the four basic feedback types around each of the four basic amplifier types, we have a total of sixteen different configurations. This paper discusses the effect of the negative feedback in each of these sixteen cases. In general, the closed-loop transfer function approximates the reciprocal of the feedback network transfer function so that any one of the four types of amplifiers may be transfonned (with the proper choice of feedback) into any of the three other basic types, or into an improved version of the same type.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4320257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.1967.4320268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/4320257/04320268.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","doi":"10.1109/TE.1967.4320268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Sixteen Faces of Feedback: A Catalogue of the Basic Negative Feedback Amplifier Configurations","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1967","displayDocTitle":"The Sixteen Faces of Feedback: A Catalogue of the Basic Negative Feedback Amplifier Configurations","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1967","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4320268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Sixteen Faces of Feedback: A Catalogue of the Basic Negative Feedback Amplifier Configurations","sourcePdf":"TE-v10-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020629S","chronDate":"Sept.  1967","isNumber":"4320257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4320268","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4320366,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In the present work, impulse sampling is considered as a suppressed carrier modulation process where input sinusoidal components appear as sidebands about the sampling frequency and all of its integer multiples. Thus, signal behavior at the output of continuous elements may be interpreted in terms of these spectral components. This approach provides a deeper insight into the sampling process and raises some interesting questions about the meaning of frequency response.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4320456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.1969.4320468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/4320456/04320468.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"129","doi":"10.1109/TE.1969.4320468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Frequency Response of Sampled-Data Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1969","displayDocTitle":"On the Frequency Response of Sampled-Data Systems","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1969","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4320468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1969","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Frequency Response of Sampled-Data Systems","sourcePdf":"TE-v12-n2-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022617S","chronDate":"June  1969","isNumber":"4320456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4320468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4320543,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This report, which presented in considerable detailarecommended curriculum in computer science and engineering, came at a fortunate time for a committee in the Department of Electical and Computer Engineering (E& CE) at aemson Univemity. Although the Department of E&CE had been so named since the eady 1970's, this committee was in the process of prepaing the proposal for a computer engineerng degree to accompany the long-existing elctnical engineerng degree. This committee, along with the entire E& CE faculty, the faculty of an emerging Department of Computer Science, and the university administration, was to face, within the next two years, many problems associated with computer education. As evidence that solutions to most of the problems were found, final permission to offer the computer engineering degree, along with the computer science degree, was granted in early 1980. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the citical questions that arose during this period, and to discuss the partial answers as determined at Clemson, in the hope that such information can be helphul to otha departments and universities encountering similar situations.","doi":"10.1109/TE.1982.4321528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/4321519/04321528.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4321519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.1982.4321528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","startPage":"33","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a Computer Engineering Program: Some Fundamental Questions and a Curriculum","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4321528","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a Computer Engineering Program: Some Fundamental Questions and a Curriculum","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4321528/","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a Computer Engineering Program: Some Fundamental Questions and a Curriculum","sourcePdf":"TE-v25-n1-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037468S","chronDate":"Feb.  1982","isNumber":"4321519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4321528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4321556,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed F.

With respect to future developments, we feel that greater speed of operation and extension to multiple channels would further extend the range of applications and increase the versatility of the device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4322850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1961","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1961","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1961","pubMedId":"13693866","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Average Response Computer (ARC): A Digital Device for Computing Averages and Amplitude and Time Histograms of Electrophysiological Response","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Average Response Computer (ARC): A Digital Device for Computing Averages and Amplitude and Time Histograms of Electrophysiological Response","sourcePdf":"TMBE3-v8-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030913S","chronDate":"Jan.  1961","isNumber":"4322838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4322768","citationCount":"26","articleId":"4322850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4322998,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Then we develop the flow graph interpretation of these relations. We consider the special cases of counting transitions, transient processes, and first passage times. We investigate the effect on interval transition probabilities of starting the process in different ways, including choosing a time at random to begin observation of the process.

The wave field, which is a continuous space-time function, is converted into a discrete set of time functions by an array of transducer elements which convert the physical field quantities into other quantities appropriate for processing. The resulting set of time functions makes up a vector random process. A generalization of the one-dimensional Karhunen-Loeve expansion applied to the vector random process yields a series representation with uncorrelated coefficients. The effects of complex element weighting and of internal noise are considered in describing the noise and signal vector processes. If the noise field is Gaussian, the conditional probability density functions of the vector processes, under the hypotheses of noise alone and of signal pulse noise, are straightforwardly written, leading directly to the likelihood ratio for a completely known signal. The operation to obtain a test statistic based upon the likelihood ratio is interpreted as a set of filtering operations, time-varying in the general case where the noise field is not wide-sense stationary. When the noise field is wide-sense stationary, the field may be described by a spectral density matrix whose elements are the cross-spectral densities of the total noise at the transducers taken in pairs. The operation to obtain the test statistic is now interpreted as a set of filtering operations described by a filtering matrix.","doi":"10.1109/TME.1965.4323175","pdfPath":"/iel5/4323026/4323163/04323175.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"56","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Military Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Military Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TME.1965.4323175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4323163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Detection and Estimation of Wave Fields for Surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4323175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1965","displayDocTitle":"On Detection and Estimation of Wave Fields for Surveillance","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1965","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Detection and Estimation of Wave Fields for Surveillance","sourcePdf":"TMIL1-v9-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059615S","chronDate":"Jan.  1965","isNumber":"4323163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4323026","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4323175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4323176,"authors":[{"name":"E.

These effects include large increases in leakage current, changes in gain, and increases in noise. Studies have been made of the effects of dose, dose rate, bias, transistor environment, and surface protection, in addition to the phenomena of recovery and memory. The greatest changes occur when bias and radiation are applied simultaneously to a gas-encapsulated silicon transistor with unprotected surfaces. Most of these effects can be qualitatively explained through the use of a simple model of the process. Radiation ionizes the encapsulating gas, and the resulting ions and electrons are directed to transistor surfaces by electric fields at the junction surfaces and between the transistor and its can. Inversion layers are produced at the surface which grossly change certain transistor parameters. The great variability among devices of the same type suggests that the gas ions interact with the surface by imparting charge to surface contaminants. Detailed investigation of the influence of electric fields between a transistor structure and its can have been carried out on special gas-encapsulated mesa and planar transistors which are electrically insulated from their cans. Results indicate that inversion layers on both collector and base are affecting ICBO. while, as would be expected, gain is altered principally by an inversion layer on the base. In the gasencapsulated planar devices the effect of can bias on ICBO is greatly reduced and its effect on gain is practically zero.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface Effects of Radiation on Transistors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1963.4323302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4323292/04323302.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1963.4323302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4323292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4323302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4323302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1963","displayDocTitle":"Surface Effects of Radiation on Transistors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface Effects of Radiation on Transistors","sourcePdf":"TNS-v10-n5-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043884S","chronDate":"Nov.  1963","isNumber":"4323292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4323302","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4323360,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Such internal electric field values (peak fields of 60 - 250 kilovolts cm-1) are attainable over distances of up to 250 microns through the use of geometrical control of the field existing at the surface of the junction. Amplification factor for the simple P + N geometry studied thus far is not constant being greatest for the short range particles and decreasing as particle range into the detector increases. In the amplifying mode, a directional effect is observed with amplification being dependent upon energy loss in the region of highest field (and thus the direction of the particle). Detector response has been measured for incident alpha particles, beta particles in the energy range from 0.04 MeV to minimum ionizing, protons from 0.5 - 3.0 MeV, and for 5 keV x-rays. Pulse risetimes which should be in the sub-nanosecond range for these geometries have been measured with alpha particles and with synchronous 0.88 and 1.06 micron wavelength photons from pulsed lasers with the detector being able to follow laser pulses with 2 - 5 nanosecond risetime.

If the light frequency is properly selected, sufficient and relatively uniform energy deposition is obtained which results in ionization rates orders of magnitude above those presently attainable from other sources. It is shown that a pulsed-infrared laser can be used as a relatively simple, inexpensive, and effective means of simulating the effects caused by intense gamma ray sources on semiconductors. Experimental results are presented which show that the transients induced in various types of silicon transistors when exposed to a neodymium laser are essentially identical to those obtained when the transistors are exposed to pulses of 25 MeV electrons from a linear accelerator and 600 kvp flash X-ray machine. Good agreement exists between the peak photocurrents obtained using these three sources over a dose range of 10-1 to 104 rads. Calculations based upon published as well as experimental absorption data for silicon show that energy deposition is very nearly uniform for the wavelength of light obtained from neodymium lasers (1. 06 microns - 1. 17 ev photons). By defocusing the laser light beam, dose rates in excess of 10R12 rads/ sec (silicon) in 40 x 1-99 seconds over an area of 50 cm2 have been obtained from a Q-switched 10 megawatt neodymium laser.

The basic amplifier, without shaping, is stable to within 50 ppm/\u00b0C at gains up to 1024, and exhibits \u00b10. 01% linearity up to 10 volts output. The basic feedback loop used in this amplifier has been analyzed in a previous article for gain stability as a function of temperature. The results of this analysis are summarized here, and a theoretical study is made of some additional feedback loop characteristics - frequency stability, transient response, and temperature stability versus input pulse rise time. With large output swings and/or high count rates special problems arise affecting risetime, fall time, linearity, and zero-crossover walk. The causes of these problems are determined using simple feedback loop theory.

For example, the time distribution for x rays (31. 6 keV) relative to the conversion electrons from a Cs137 source, shows a full width at half maximum of 1.6 nsec and a slope corresponding to a half life T4324091 = 0.63 nsec. This implies that \u03c4 /R is much smaller than commonly believed, where \u03c4 is the mean life of the scintillation and R is the average number of photoelectrons per event. This small value is not due to a small \u03c4 because only the usual slow component is observed when the shape of the scintillation is measured by a probability technique. Therefore R must be larger than expected; the observed time resolution requires at least 8.7 photoelectrons/ keV. This is consistent with the value 9.3 p.e./ keV inferred from the pulse-height resolution obtained with artificial light pulses which are equivalent in amplitude to a 662-keV event in NaI(Tl). It is also consistent with the value (9. 1 p.e./keV) obtained by combining the absolute efficiency of NaI(Tl) measured by Van Sciver and Bogart with the quantum efficiency that RCA lists for the bi-alkali photocathode.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1966.4324091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4324068/04324091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1966.4324091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4324068","startPage":"140","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Timing with NaI(Tl)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4324091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Timing with NaI(Tl)","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4324091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1966","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1966","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Timing with NaI(Tl)","sourcePdf":"TNS-v13-n3-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033595S","chronDate":"June  1966","isNumber":"4324068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"47","articleId":"4324091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4324133,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Optimum processing functions (weighting functions) are considered for an ideal system, and for real conditions where effects like imperfect pole-zero cancellation are present. Time-variant filters of the gain-varying class are used to realize the required optimum weighting functions of finite width. It is shown how nonfinite-width weighting functions of some time-invariant filters can be modified into finite-width functions by switching. These switched-gain time-variant filters are somewhat limited in choice of weighting functions. A general processing system can be realized employing filters with continuously time-variant elements. In particular, a gain-varying element (i.e., an analog multiplier) can be used in conjunction with an integrator to realize arbitrary weighting functions, and therefore the theoretically maximum signal-to-noise ratio. The system is time-variant only for the noise and not for the signal, so that it does not require high precision of the time-variant element. The system output is independent of the gating interval, and does not require precise timing. A method for evaluation of such systems in terms of noise, ballistic deficit and sensitivity to parameter variations is given.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectroscopy","Noise generators","Filters","Signal processing","White noise","Signal to noise ratio","Voltage","Signal analysis","Random sequences","Capacitance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNS.1968.4324970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4324907/04324970.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4324907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1968.4324970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Signal-Processing for Pulse-Amplitude Spectrometry in the Presence of High-Rate Effects and Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4324970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Signal-Processing for Pulse-Amplitude Spectrometry in the Presence of High-Rate Effects and Noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4324970/","volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1968","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Signal-Processing for Pulse-Amplitude Spectrometry in the Presence of High-Rate Effects and Noise","sourcePdf":"TNS-v15-n3-63.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027686S","chronDate":"June  1968","isNumber":"4324907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"89","articleId":"4324970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4325054,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper presents the results of an extensive experimental program to determine pulse power failure levels of semiconductor junctions. Approximately 80 different types of silicon diodes and transistors were studied with variations in junction areas from 10-4to 10-1 cm2 and with widely varying junction geometries. Power levels of up to two kilowatts, with time durations of 0.1 to 20 microseconds, were applied to semiconductor junctions in both forward and reverse polarity modes. A semi-empirical formula, based on experimental data and on a simple thermal failure model is given.

This class of noise is widespread in nature, and it presents unique limitations to the measurement accuracy. In an attempt to present a picture of this class of noise with regard to the measurements of observable physical quantities, the questions about generation of noise, its divergence, correlation properties and measurements of variance are discussed. A statistical model for generation of low frequency divergent noises is used to consider the divergence problem in both the frequency and time domain. It is shown that 1/|f| noise is \"weakly divergent,\" and that power limitation presents no reason to impose a low frequency limit within time intervals observable in nature. Correlation properties are discussed in terms of the time-dependent correlation function, using an ideal impulse response which generates low frequency noise from white noise. Two general models for generation of 1/|f| noise are summarized and discussed. Generation of 1/|f| noise from white noise over a limited frequency range by distributed and lumped-parameter filters is described. It is shown that the variance (i.e. mean square noise) is determined by the frequency limits of the observation method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4325467/04325473.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"35","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1969.4325473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1969.4325473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4325467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4325473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1/|f| Noise in Physical Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Low-frequency noise","Semiconductor device noise","1f noise","Noise generators","Fluctuations","White noise","Frequency measurement","Semiconductor devices","MOSFETs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4325473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1969","displayDocTitle":"1/|f| Noise in Physical Measurements","volume":"16","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1969","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1/|f| Noise in Physical Measurements","sourcePdf":"TNS-v16-n5-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043035S","chronDate":"Oct.  1969","isNumber":"4325467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"53","articleId":"4325473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4325513,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The results show that, at peak doserate values of less than 8 \u00d7 108 rads (Si)/s, the transient change in output voltage of a CMOS inverter is small and can be attributed simply to the net junction photocurrent flowing at the output node. At dose rates in excess of 8 \u00d7 108 rads (Si)/s, however, a new type of response comes into play and the transient change in output voltage becomes very large, approaching the operating voltage. In some instances, this change can result in a non-destructive temporary latch-up condition.

This paper presents guidelines which will assist the designer to predict the limits within which the values of these changes will fall.

Because of large bandwidths and low-noise performance, the preamplifier, connected directly to a fast leading-edge discriminator, generates very accurate timing data. A preamplifier consisting of three gain stages was built and subsequently tested with Ge(Li) detectors. This preamplifier had a current gain of 10,000, a rise time of 8 nsec with a 10 pF detector capacitance, and a 0-pF noise line width, using an RC-RC ungated filter, of 1.4 keV (fwhm Ge). With the preamplifier operating from a 10 cc Ge(Li) coaxial detector, timing experiments utilizing the 60Co gamma cascade indicated resolutions as low as 1.15 nsec fwhm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4326473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1972.4326539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4326473/04326539.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"395","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1972.4326539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Broadband Current Preamplifier Configuration for Obtaining Htgh Resolutton Energy and Time Information from Nuclear Radiation Detectors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1972","displayDocTitle":"A Broadband Current Preamplifier Configuration for Obtaining Htgh Resolutton Energy and Time Information from Nuclear Radiation Detectors","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1972","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4326539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1972","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Broadband Current Preamplifier Configuration for Obtaining Htgh Resolutton Energy and Time Information from Nuclear Radiation Detectors","sourcePdf":"TNS-v19-n1-66.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042492S","chronDate":"Feb.  1972","isNumber":"4326473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4326539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4326708,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This experimental 2 inch phototube designed at LEP allows a spatial and temporal control of the electron emission from small elements of the photocathode. The originality of the tube lies in the use of a cross bar control grid embedded in the glass of the window at a short distance (d = 1 mm) from the photosensitive layer. The amplitude of the anode signal obtained in response to a light flash is dependent on the electrical voltage applied to the X or Y wire of the grid associated with the excited element of the photocathode. In such a way it has been shown that the position of a point light source scanning the photocathode plane of the PM could be determined with a resolution of 5 mm.

The films were 0.05 to 1.25 mm thick. The x-ray spectrum peaked in the vicinity of 10 keV, and the x-ray pulse width was about 40 nsec FWHM. X-ray induced photocurrents were found to obey Ohm's law at low bias voltages (less than 1 kV). Above 1 kV, however, we observed that the peak photoconductivity signals from some of the 0.05-mm-thick materials began to increase at a slightly faster than linear rate with bias voltage. The glass samples exhibited no apparent delayed conductivity, while the other sample materials showed various amounts. The magnitude of the delayed conductivity in polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyimide depended on the electric field, an effect that is consistent with Poole-Frenkel field assisted carrier generation.

The effects produced by bombardment of bare-silicon-diode arrays or vidicon tubes with 85kV x-rays, Cobalt 60 gamma rays, 1 MeV and 11 MeV electrons, 3 MeV and 142 MeV protons, and reactor neutrons are presented. Results show that the dark (reverse bias) current of a diode array increases less than a factor of 2 if the fluence level is less than 104 rads of gamma radiation or 4 \u00d71011 1 MeV electrons/cm2. For these same dose levels, the quantum efficiency increases rather than decreases. Continued bombardment in excess of these fluences decreases the quantum efficiency and increases the dark current. Electrons of 11 MeV were more damaging than 1 MeV electrons by a factor of 10 to 20 while protons of 3 MeV more effectively produced dark current increases and quantum efficiency degradation in silicon diode arrays than 1 MeV electrons by a factor of 105 in fluence. Protons of 142 MeV were less effective than 3 MeV protons in producing the same effects by a factor of 102 in fluence.

The damage mechanism was tentatively identified to be the result of a [B10 (n, \u03b1) Li7] reaction in the emitter region of the device whereby energetic alpha and Li particles are emitted and subsequently produce damage in the base region of the device.

If an electric field of either polarity is present in the SiO2 during 76\u00b0K irradiation, to sweep out the mobile electrons, the holes will virtually all be trapped where created and produce a uniform positive charge density in the oxide. This predicts \u0394VT \u221d dox2 , which is observed. The magnitude of the observed shift is consistent with 18 eV required per hole-electron pair generated. All CMOS transistors of the same oxide thickness exhibit the same initial \u0394VT, for a given exposure level, regardless of oxide type or process. The rate of annealing differs, both as a function of oxidation process and oxide thickness. Thin oxides have two advantages: a smaller \u0394VT (stable shift) and faster annealing. If a CMOS device is irradiated for sufficient time at 76\u00b0K to build in an appreciable field, further irradiation with zero gate-substrate bias will produce little additional change in VT, since the field in the oxide tends to keep all generated electrons in the oxide, where they recombine with trapped holes. Room temperature annealing following a pulsed gamma exposure occurs in two regimes. The first regime can be quite fast, and occurs prior to 10-4 seconds. The magnitude of this early-time recovery is both process dependent and thickness dependent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4328097/","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1975","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unified Model of Damage Annealing in CMOS, from Freeze-In to Transient Annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Model of Damage Annealing in CMOS, from Freeze-In to Transient Annealing","sourcePdf":"TNS-v22-n6-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034041S","chronDate":"Dec.  1975","isNumber":"4328085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4328097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4328098,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The radiation-induced flatband voltage shift (\u0394 VFB) in SiO2 MOS capacitors was measured with a fast C-V technique from 70 \u03bcsec to 1000 sec after a 60 krad radiation pulse for temperatures from 80 to 293 K. In complementary experiments, the post-irradiation charge displacement in the MOS capacitors was measured with an integrating picoammeter. By correlating the relaxation of the flatband voltage with integrated current measurements, it was established that the measured response is dominated by hole transport and trapping in the SiO2 film. The temporal and temperature dependences of the hole transport are well described by a stochastic hopping model based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW). The essential feature of the CTRW is that the transport occurs via a carrier hopping (phonon assisted) process between localized sites randomly distributed in the amorphous SiO2. Since the carriers do not require excitation to the band edges in order to be mobilized, the activation energy for conduction (tunneling) is independent of the optical excitation energy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4328098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1975","publicationDate":"Dec. 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"22","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Role Transport and Charge Relaxation in Irradiated SiO2 MOS Capacitors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Role Transport and Charge Relaxation in Irradiated SiO2 MOS Capacitors","sourcePdf":"TNS-v22-n6-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024094S","chronDate":"Dec.  1975","isNumber":"4328085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4328098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4328107,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These measurements were made using radiation-hardened aluminum-gate CMOS inverter circuits and have been corroborated by independent data taken from MOS capacitor structures. Knowledge of these relationships allows one to define ranges of acceptable CMOS design parameters based upon radiation-hardening capabilities and post-irradiation performance specifications. Furthermore, they permit actual design optimization of CMOS integrated circuits which results in optimum pre-and post-irradiation performance with respect to speed, noise margins, and quiescent power consumption.

If taken into account, the stochastic nature has been used to calculate the performance of algorithms which were developed independent of probabilistic considerations. This paper utilizes the knowledge of the probability density function of the measurements from the outset, and derives a reconstruction scheme which is optimal in the maximum likelihood sense. This algorithm is shown to yield an image which is unbiased -- that is, on the average it equals the object being reconstructed -- and which has the minimum variance of any estimator using the same measurements. As such, when operated in a stochastic environment, it will perform better than any current reconstruction technique, where the performance measures are the bias and viariance.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1976.4328496","startPage":"1428","endPage":"1432","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4328466/04328496.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1976.4328496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4328466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Maximum Likelihood Approach to Emission Image Reconstruction from Projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Maximum likelihood estimation","Probability density function","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors","H infinity control","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Indexing","State estimation","Parameter estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4328496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1976","displayDocTitle":"A Maximum Likelihood Approach to Emission Image Reconstruction from Projections","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maximum Likelihood Approach to Emission Image Reconstruction from Projections","sourcePdf":"TNS-v23-n4-30.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057917S","chronDate":"Aug.  1976","isNumber":"4328466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"147","articleId":"4328496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4328530,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A quantitative comparison of the response characteristics of the different oxides is made. It is found generally that the response consists of two stages. The first (early time) stage in most cases encompasses most of the recovery and is dominated by hole transport through the insulator film to the interface. This hole transport recovery stage in all the oxides studied is well described by the stochastic model of hopping transport based on a continuous time random walk used previously in the analysis of hole transport in SiO2. It is further shown that all the main features of the hole transport are consistent with a model of the holes moving via polaron hopping between localized sites in the SiO2. The second or long-term stage of recovery commences after cessation of the hole transport in the oxide and is found to vary significantly in its importance and time of onset among the various oxides. This stage involves a radiation-induced buildup of interface states and possibly, in some cases, an annealing of a trapped-hole distribution near the SiO2/Si interface.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4328530/","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hole Transport and Recovery Characteristics of SiO2 Gate Insulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hole Transport and Recovery Characteristics of SiO2 Gate Insulators","sourcePdf":"TNS-v23-n6-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030861S","chronDate":"Dec.  1976","isNumber":"4328519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"116","articleId":"4328530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4328531,"authors":[{"name":"J.

At room temperature for high applied fields, nearly all electrons and holes generated in the oxide by a pulse of ionizing radiation (5-keV electrons) drift to the interfaces, whereas at low temperatures only electrons contribute to observed transport for relatively low fields. Below ~130\u00b0K at high fields, field-induced emission of trapped holes occurs, giving rise to collection within seconds of a significant fraction of the total number of holes generated. The present hole transport data are accounted for quite well in terms of a multiple-trapping model with a spread in trap levels ranging from ~0.3 to ~0.5 eV from the valence band. Comparison with the stochastic hopping transport model is made and that model is found to be less satisfactory in explaining these data. Charge buildup was examined in a Co60 environment and it is demonstrated that oxides exhibiting radiation tolerance at room temperature display severe radiation-induced changes at 77\u00b0K. It is also demonstrated that low-temperature charge buildup problems can be alleviated either by employing an ion-implanted oxide or by applying a relatively high field to the oxide during irradiation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1976","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4328531/","volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1976","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-Induced Charge Transport and Charge Buildup in SiO2 Films at Low Temperatures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-Induced Charge Transport and Charge Buildup in SiO2 Films at Low Temperatures","sourcePdf":"TNS-v23-n6-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054652S","chronDate":"Dec.  1976","isNumber":"4328519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4328531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4328532,"authors":[{"name":"H.

From the results of the pulsed e-beam experiment, we show that in the wet oxide the electric field affects the time scale for the buildup of interface states as well as the final or saturation value of interface states at late times (~105 s), but that in the dry oxide there is no marked field dependence. For the wet oxide, we observed that temperature affects only the time scale for the buildup of interface states. From total-dose Co60 measurements, we report a power law dependence on dose, D0.65, for both wet and dry oxide capacitors.

The read control, write control, and multiplexer control LSI circuits range in complexity from 550 to more than 750 gates each (2000 to 3000 transistors). This discussion presents the results of the total dose radiation testing on these circuits to levels up to, and including, 1 x 107 rads(Si). For the worst case LSI device, the minimum operating supply voltage increased from approximately 2 volts to only about 6 volts when irradiated to 107 rads. This is well below the intended nominal operating supply voltage of 10 volts. These radiation-induced shifts in minimum operating voltage are related to threshold shifts in the P-channel devices. Results of P-channel threshold shifts for three different gate bias conditions during irradiation are presented. The worst case (+10 volts bias) was eliminated in the LSI designs to optimize radiation hardness. This paper also discusses the recovery of device parameters toward their initial pre-irradiation values. Recovery occurred over a period of several days after irradiation due to annealing of trapped charge in the gate oxide and at the silicon-sapphire interface.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"2177","endPage":"2180","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1977.4329187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1977.4329187","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4329154/04329187.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4329154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardened CMOS/SOS LSI Circuits for Satellite Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4329187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1977","displayDocTitle":"Hardened CMOS/SOS LSI Circuits for Satellite Applications","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1977","volume":"24","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardened CMOS/SOS LSI Circuits for Satellite Applications","sourcePdf":"TNS-v24-n6-33.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034672S","chronDate":"Dec.  1977","isNumber":"4329154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4329187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4329200,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Some of the existing RCT reconstruction algorithms apply approximation formulas to the projection data for attenuation correction, while others take attenuation into account through some iterative procedures. The drawbacks of these algorithms are that the approximation formulas commonly used are generally inadequate and the iterative procedures are usually very time-consuming. The method for attenuation correction in RCT, which we propose, applied a simple, effective two-step procedure to the uncorrected image. In this procedure the filtered back-projection algorithm is used for its fast speed. A simple mathematical basis and description of the procedure together with some illustrative computer results are given in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1978.4329385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4329261/04329385.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1978.4329385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4329261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Attenuation Correction in Radionuclide Computed Tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4329385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4329385/","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Attenuation Correction in Radionuclide Computed Tomography","volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1978","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Attenuation Correction in Radionuclide Computed Tomography","sourcePdf":"TNS-v25-n1-124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030311S","chronDate":"Feb.  1978","isNumber":"4329261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"867","articleId":"4329385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4329453,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Two sets of samples were studied: one set grown to a single thickness and then etched back to various thicknesses, and the other set grown for different lengths of time to varying thicknesses. In both cases, the recovery time was observed to vary approximately as the fourth power of oxide thickness. This anomalous superlinear dependence of recovery time on the SiO2 thickness agrees with the predictions of the stochastic model of hole transport based on a continuous-time random walk. Combining the highly field activated character of hole transport in SiO2 with the thickness dependence reported here demonstrates that very significant gains in the short-term recovery speed can be made by reducing the oxide thickness and/or increasing the oxide field.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4329497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4329497/04329519.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1978.4329519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1978.4329519","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Flatband Voltage Recovery in Hardened Thin MOS Capacitors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4329519/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Flatband Voltage Recovery in Hardened Thin MOS Capacitors","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Flatband Voltage Recovery in Hardened Thin MOS Capacitors","sourcePdf":"TNS-v25-n6-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046447S","chronDate":"Dec.  1978","isNumber":"4329497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"44","articleId":"4329519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4329547,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This requires a precise analysis of longitudinal motion including stability analysis. Previous papers have treated the longitudinal space charge force as strictly linear, and have not been self-consistent; that is, they have not displayed a phase space distribution consistent with this linear force so that the transport of the phase space distribution could be followed, and departures from linearity could be analyzed. This is unlike the situation for transverse phase space where the Kapchinskij-Vladimirskij (K-V) distribution can be used as the basis of an analysis of transverse motion. In this paper we derive a self-consistent particle distribution in longitudinal phase space which is a solution of the Vlasov equation and derive an envelope equation for this solution. The solution is developed in Section II from a stationary solution of the Vlasov equation derived in Section I.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4329904/04329929.pdf","startPage":"3031","endPage":"3033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.1979.4329929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.1979.4329929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4329904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4329929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Longitudinal Motion in High Current Ion Beams - A Self-Consistent Phase Space Distribution with an Envelope Equation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ion beams","Equations","Space charge","Particle beams","Motion analysis","Linear particle accelerator","Stability analysis","Linearity","Acceleration","Contracts"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4329929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1979","displayDocTitle":"Longitudinal Motion in High Current Ion Beams - A Self-Consistent Phase Space Distribution with an Envelope Equation","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1979","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Longitudinal Motion in High Current Ion Beams - A Self-Consistent Phase Space Distribution with an Envelope Equation","sourcePdf":"TNS-v26-n3-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020808S","chronDate":"June  1979","isNumber":"4329904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4329929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
