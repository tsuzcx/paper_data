It represents an evolution of a previously developed wavelet formalism developed by Antoine & Vandergheynst and Wiaux et al. The translations of the wavelets at any point on the sphere and their proper rotations are still defined through the continuous three-dimensional rotations. The dilations of the wavelets are directly defined in harmonic space through a new kernel dilation, which is a modification of an existing harmonic dilation. A family of factorized steerable functions with compact harmonic support which are suitable for this kernel dilation are first identified. A scale-discretized wavelet formalism is then derived, relying on this dilation. The discrete nature of the analysis scales allows the exact reconstruction of band-limited signals. A corresponding exact multi-resolution algorithm is finally described and an implementation is tested. The formalism is of interest notably for the denoising or the deconvolution of signals on the sphere with a sparse expansion in wavelets. In astrophysics, it finds a particular application for the identification of localized directional features in the cosmic microwave background data, such as the imprint of topological defects, in particular, cosmic strings, and for their reconstruction after separation from the other signal components.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13448.x","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8220528/08220552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13448.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8220528","startPage":"770","endPage":"788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact reconstruction with directional wavelets on the sphere","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8220552","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Exact reconstruction with directional wavelets on the sphere","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8220552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"388","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact reconstruction with directional wavelets on the sphere","sourcePdf":"mnras03880770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041158S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"8220528","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","citationCount":"21","articleId":"8220552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":8221060,"authors":[{"name":"Junying Gan","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Junying","lastName":"Gan","id":"37289400400"},{"name":"Shanlu Li","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Shanlu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086318589"},{"name":"Yikui Zhai","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yikui","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37404405700"},{"name":"Chengyun Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Wuyi University, Jiangmen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Chengyun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086318835"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5954-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5955-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8221060","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":868},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8221060","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Convolution","Three-dimensional displays","Databases","Feature extraction","Training","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","face recognition","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","security of data","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition security","image feature extraction","video frame feature learning","Replay-Attack","CASIA","face anti-spoofing public databases","continuous video frames","video attack","3D convolutional neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D convolution neural network; face anti-spoofing; living face detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMIP.2017.9","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187603/8221051/08221060.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Multimedia and Image Processing (ICMIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference on Multimedia and Image Processing (ICMIP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8221051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMIP.2017.9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Convolutional Neural Network Based on Face Anti-spoofing","abstract":"Face anti-spoofing is very significant to the security of face recognition.

To realize face anti-spoofing, the spatiotemporal features of continuous video frames are extracted using 3D convolution neural network (CNN) from the short video frame level. Experimental results show that the two sets of face anti-spoofing public databases, Replay-Attack and CASIA, have achieved the HTER (Half Total Error Rate) of 0.04% and 10.65%, respectively, which is better than the state-of-the-art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8221060/","accessionNumber":"17452541","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8221060/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"3D Convolutional Neural Network Based on Face Anti-spoofing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Convolutional Neural Network Based on Face Anti-spoofing","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"5954a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094424S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187603","isNumber":"8221051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187603","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8221051","articleId":"8221060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8221063,"authors":[{"name":"Tongfan Guan","affiliation":["School of Automation.

However, detecting small scale objects is still a challenging task. This paper addresses the problem and proposes a unified deep neural network building upon the prominent Faster R-CNN framework. This paper has two main contributions. Firstly, an Atrous Region Proposal Network (ARPN) is proposed to explore object contexts at multiple scales by sliding a set of atrous filters with increasing dilation rates over the last convolutional feature map. Secondly, to enrich the representations of small scale image regions, this paper incorporates atrous convolution into Fast R-CNN and proposes a Dense Fast R-CNN (DFRCN), that improves the resolution of the ROI-pooled convolutional feature maps without increasing the number of parameters. In combination of the two, this paper proposes a unified network termed as Atrous Faster R-CNN. On PASCAL object detection challenge dataset, our method achieves superior performance to the state of the arts, especially for small scale objects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8221063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"17452548","htmlLink":"/document/8221063/","dateOfInsertion":"25 December 2017","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Atrous Faster R-CNN for Small Scale Object Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Atrous Faster R-CNN for Small Scale Object Detection","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"5954a016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095474S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187603","isNumber":"8221051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187603","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8221051","articleId":"8221063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8221078,"authors":[{"name":"TiangYang Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qing Dao, China"],"firstName":"TiangYang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086298614"},{"name":"Bo Yin","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qing Dao, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yin","id":"37327076400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5954-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5955-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8221078","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Feature extraction","Neural networks","Training","Smart grids","Fans","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","backpropagation","feature extraction","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system measurement","power system reliability","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network","nonintrusive load monitoring","power signals","reactive power","active power","main switchboard NILM","current sensor","current signal","back propagation neural network","power outages","power supply","steady state characteristics","load transient state"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noninstrusive load monitoring;back-propagation neural network; feature extraction; artificial intelligence identification technology; load current acquisition technology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8221078","abstract":"In this paper, a new method of non intrusive load monitoring (NILM) feature extraction is proposed.

In four repetitions, in the last trial, it took participants only 1.8 times longer to complete the email task, on average, using the mTDS versus KnM at 82.4% typing accuracy. Mean task completion time and typing accuracy improved 24.6% and 18.8% from first to fourth trial using mTDS.

The motivation is to obtain biological insight into the interpretation of such input-output (Volterra-equivalent) models estimated from synthetic data. The insights obtained may be subsequently used to interpretat input-output models extracted from actual experimental data. Specifically, we found that a simplified parametric model may serve as a useful tool to study the signal transformations in the hippocampal CA3-CA1 regions. Input-output modeling of model-based synthetic data show that GABAergic interneurons are responsible for regulating neuronal excitation, controlling the precision of spike timing, and maintaining network oscillations, in a manner consistent with previous studies. The input-output model obtained from real data exhibits intriguing similarities with its synthetic-data counterpart, demonstrating the importance of a dynamic resonance in the system/model response around 2 Hz to 3 Hz. Using the input-output model from real data as a guide, we may be able to amend the parametric model by incorporating more mechanisms in order to yield better-matching input-output model. The approach we present can also be applied to the study of other neural systems and pathways.</para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8222987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mechanism-Based and Input-Output Modeling of the Key Neuronal Connections and Signal Transformations in the CA3-CA1 Regions of the Hippocampus","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanism-Based and Input-Output Modeling of the Key Neuronal Connections and Signal Transformations in the CA3-CA1 Regions of the Hippocampus","sourcePdf":"neco_a_01031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022314S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","isNumber":"8222982","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8222987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"MIT Periodical","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8223209,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Yue","firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yue"},{"name":"Benedetta Ciardi","firstName":"Benedetta","lastName":"Ciardi"},{"name":"Evan Scannapieco","firstName":"Evan","lastName":"Scannapieco"},{"name":"Xuelei Chen","firstName":"Xuelei","lastName":"Chen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0035-8711"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-2966"}],"articleNumber":"8223209","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8223209","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["galaxies: haloes","galaxies: high-redshift","intergalactic medium","cosmology: theory","diffuse radiation","large-scale structure of Universe"]}],"abstract":"We study the statistical properties of the cosmological 21-cm signal from both the intergalactic medium (IGM) and minihaloes, using a reionization simulation that includes a self-consistent treatment of minihalo photoevaporation.

The primary goal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchers outside the shear measurement community. Six GREAT08 Team methods were presented at the launch of the Challenge and five additional groups submitted results during the 6-month competition. Participants analyzed 30 million simulated galaxies with a range in signal-to-noise ratio, point spread function ellipticity, galaxy size and galaxy type. The large quantity of simulations allowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracy suitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the first time. Different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameter space and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. A number of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the Challenge including a re-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies, which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. The image simulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future GREAT Challenges, meanwhile the GREAT08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additional developments in shear measurement algorithms.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16598.x","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8224153/08224203.pdf","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16598.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8224153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Results of the GREAT08 Challenge: an image analysis competition for cosmological lensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8224203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Results of the GREAT08 Challenge: an image analysis competition for cosmological lensing","volume":"405","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Results of the GREAT08 Challenge: an image analysis competition for cosmological lensing","sourcePdf":"mnras04052044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048859S","chronDate":"July  2010","isNumber":"8224153","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8224203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8225623,"authors":[{"name":"Yingjie Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8225623/yan-2784841-small.gif","p":["Yingjie Yan received the B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering.

However, its low-voltage ridethrough (LVRT) capability is insufficient, which results in difficulties in limiting the current and provide reactive power support. A new LVRT control strategy based on the smooth switching is proposed in this paper. In this strategy, the voltage source mode of VSG is transformed into current source mode to limit the output current and provide reactive power support through the proportional resonance current control algorithm under grid fault. Furthermore, the feedback tracking synchronization strategy of the phase angle is employed to realize the smooth switching between two modes.

On the other hand, the communication over the orthogonal states/modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a subset of the solutions offered by massive-MIMO communications. Traditional massive-MIMO-based mmWave communications did not concern the potential spectrum-efficiency-gain (SE-gain) offered by the orthogonal states of OAM. However, the highly expected maximum SE-gain for OAM and massive-MIMO communications is the product of SE-gains offered by OAM and multiplexing-MIMO. In this paper, we propose the OAM-embedded-MIMO (OEM) communication framework to obtain the multiplicative SE-gain for joint OAM and massive-MIMO-based mmWave wireless communications. We design the parabolic antenna for each uniform circular array antenna to converge OAM signals. Then, we develop the mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme to obtain the transmit signal on each OAM-mode of each transmit antenna. Also, we develop the OEM-water-filling power allocation policy to achieve the maximum multiplicative SE-gain for OEM communications. The extensive simulations obtained validate and evaluate our developed a parabolic antenna-based converging method, a mode-decomposition and multiplexing-detection scheme, and an OEM-water-filling policy, showing that our proposed OEM mmWave communications can significantly increase the SE as compared with the traditional massive-MIMO-based mmWave communications.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08225634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2785125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"2732","endPage":"2745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orbital-Angular-Momentum Embedded Massive MIMO: Achieving Multiplicative Spectrum-Efficiency for mmWave Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8225634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Orbital-Angular-Momentum Embedded Massive MIMO: Achieving Multiplicative Spectrum-Efficiency for mmWave Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542750","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8225634/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401330, 61671347 and 61771368"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST","grantNumber":"2016QNRC001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007128","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2016JQ6027"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B08038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Orbital-Angular-Momentum Embedded Massive MIMO: Achieving Multiplicative Spectrum-Efficiency for mmWave Communications","sourcePdf":"access-cheng-2785125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099758S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8225634","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8225635,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjun Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Hongjun Wang received the master\u2019s degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications.

Such graphs are bipartite and many of these constructions yield biregular graphs, where the degree of left vertices is a constant c + 1 and that of the right vertices is a constant d + 1. Such graphs are termed (c+1, d +1) biregular bipartite graphs. Two properties of interest in such work is the girth of the graph and the number of short cycles in the graph, cycles of length either the girth or slightly larger. Such numbers have been shown to be related to the error floor of the probability of error curve of the related LDPC code. Using known results of graph theory, it is shown how the girth and the number of cycles of length equal to the girth may be computed for these (c + 1, d + 1) biregular bipartite graphs knowing only the parameters c and d and the numbers of left and right vertices. While numerous algorithms to determine the number of short cycles in arbitrary graphs exist, the reduction of the problem from an algorithm to a computation for these biregular bipartite graphs is of interest.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2784839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8464702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2784839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8464702/08225637.pdf","startPage":"6526","endPage":"6535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Short Cycle Enumeration in Biregular Bipartite Graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"On Short Cycle Enumeration in Biregular Bipartite Graphs","volume":"64","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8225637/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18094759","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225637/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Short Cycle Enumeration in Biregular Bipartite Graphs","sourcePdf":"tit-blake-2784839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066123S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8464702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8464702","articleId":"8225637","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8225639,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Meng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Biomedical Photonics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Wuhan, China","Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Britton Chance Center for Biomedical Photonics, School of Engineering Sciences, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8225639/meng-2784838-small.gif","p":["Wang Meng received the B.E. degree in information and computing science from the Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010.

The world technology is drifting towards high frequency and data rate solutions to accommodate the future expansion in applications such as 5G communications. The 5G technology will offer advanced features in the mm-Wave frequency band which requires intelligent subsystems such as beam switching. Therefore, the microwave components, especially couplers, still need a significant improvement to follow the rapid variations in future technologies. One of the most recent and promising guiding technologies for mm-Wave applications is the printed ridge gap waveguide (PRGW). In this paper, a design of 3-dB planar quadrature hybrid coupler based on PRGW is presented. The proposed design has superior characteristics such as compactness, low loss, and low dispersion device. The prototype of the proposed coupler is fabricated and tested, where the measured and simulated results show an excellent agreement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08225640.pdf","startPage":"8501","endPage":"8509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2784801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8225640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Printed Ridge Gap Waveguide 3-dB Coupler: Analysis and Design Procedure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Couplers","Bandwidth","Waveguide discontinuities","Periodic structures","Stripline","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ridge waveguides","waveguide couplers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar quadrature hybrid coupler","5G communications","printed ridge gap waveguide coupler","PRGW","mm-Wave applications","microwave components","beam switching","intelligent subsystems","mm-Wave frequency band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid coupler","printed ridge gap waveguide","periodic structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Printed Ridge Gap Waveguide 3-dB Coupler: Analysis and Design Procedure","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8225640/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17612370","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Printed Ridge Gap Waveguide 3-dB Coupler: Analysis and Design Procedure","sourcePdf":"access-ali-2784801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072533S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8225640","onlineDate":"18 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8225722,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Malek","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8323433/8225722/malek-2777886-small.gif","p":["Salim Malek received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Blida University, Blida, Algeria, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

The purpose of this paper is to propose new methods to recover missing data in multispectral images due to the presence of clouds by relying on a formulation based on an autoencoder (AE) neural network. We suppose that clouds are opaque and their detection is performed by dedicated algorithms. The AE in our methods aims at modeling the relationship between a given cloud-free image (source image) and a cloud-contaminated image (target image). In particular, two strategies are developed: the first one performs the mapping at a pixel level while the second one at a patch level to take profit from spatial contextual information. Moreover, in order to fix the problem of the hidden layer size, a new solution combining the minimum descriptive length criterion and a Pareto-like selection procedure is introduced.

The gateway layer, which supports a variety of wireless technologies and is the core of home wireless networks access unit, together with the node layer constitutes the home wireless network. A gateway prototype following the proposed architecture has been implemented. A testbed of an interference-aware wireless network which includes the gateway prototype has also been created for testing its user interaction performances. The experimental results show that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have an impact on the ZigBee communication. Considering the complex scene of home and building, ZigBee multihop communications are set to reduce the packet loss probability. In addition, an event-level-based transmission control strategy is proposed, in which the packet loss probability of wireless network is reduced by controlling the transmission priority of different levels of monitoring events, and optimizing the ZigBee wireless network channel occupancy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry

The deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enables utilities to collect various raw data from its customers and networks. This paper presents contextual anomaly detection algorithm to detect irregular power consumption and visualize anomaly scores using unsupervised learning algorithm and temporal context generated from meter readings. The proposed algorithm computes an anomaly score for each user by considering historical consumption data. The anomaly score for a user is then adjusted by analyzing other contextual variables such as seasonal variation day of the week and other users with the same historical pattern. The implementation on real-world data set provided by power utility company shows a high performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICHVEPS.2017.8225855","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Power Systems (ICHVEPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Power Systems (ICHVEPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187164/8225853/08225855.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHVEPS.2017.8225855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data analytics-based anomaly detection in smart distribution network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8225855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225855/","displayDocTitle":"Data analytics-based anomaly detection in smart distribution network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451646","htmlLink":"/document/8225855/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data analytics-based anomaly detection in smart distribution network","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"in3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048876S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187164","isNumber":"8225853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187164","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8225853","articleId":"8225855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8225876,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Conventional methods such as P&O method may not track the Global Maximum Point (GMP). Researchers have utilized meta heuristic approaches to track the GMP. Recently Simulated Annealing (SA) method has also been adapted for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) because of its simplicity and effectiveness to locate the region which is near global maximum. However, it's tracking time to obtain GMP is excessively long. In this paper, we combine SA method with a Modified INC method to improve tracking time of the SA. The modified INC method employs an adaptive step size to increase the tracking speed and accuracy of the conventional INC. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experimental verifications are conducted. Both results indicate that the proposed algorithm can perform as well as SA in term of the tracking efficiency but it only requires very short tracking time. On average, the tracking time of the proposed method is two times shorter than the SA method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225876/","accessionNumber":"17451701","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8225876/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new MPPT method for partially shaded PV system by combining modified INC and simulated annealing algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new MPPT method for partially shaded PV system by combining modified INC and simulated annealing algorithm","confLoc":"Sanur","sourcePdf":"ts113p20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048741S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187164","isNumber":"8225853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187164","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8225853","articleId":"8225876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8225877,"authors":[{"name":"Mochammad Wahyudi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mochammad","lastName":"Wahyudi","id":"37086243608"},{"name":"I Made Yulistya Negara","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Jawa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"I Made Yulistya","lastName":"Negara","id":"38234915800"},{"name":"Dimas Anton Asfani","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Automotive Control & System ITS","Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Dimas Anton","lastName":"Asfani","id":"38018346400"},{"name":"I Gusti Ngurah Satriyadi Hernanda","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Jawa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"I Gusti Ngurah Satriyadi","lastName":"Hernanda","id":"37077122000"},{"name":"Daniar Fahmi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Daniar","lastName":"Fahmi","id":"37085411221"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0945-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0944-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0946-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8225877","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ferroresonance","Wavelet transforms","Inductance","Artificial neural networks","Power transformers","Switches","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","circuit breakers","distribution networks","feedforward neural nets","ferroresonance","potential transformers","power engineering computing","power transformers","signal classification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase distribution transformer","ANN","ferroresonance signal classification","switching operations","circuit breaker","feed-forward backpropagation network","ferroresonance mitigation","faulty switching operation","unsymmetrical switching","symmetrical switching","artificial neural network","wavelet cumulative energy","opened two-phases","opened single-phase"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ferroresonance","symmetrical and unsymmetrical switching","wavelet cumulative energy","artificial neural network","feed-forward backpropagation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8225877","abstract":"In the case of the presence of ferroresonance in distribution transformer due to a faulty switching operation, ferroresonance signals should be discriminated among its initiations due to opened single-phase, opened two-phases, and opened three-phases, so that ferroresonance mitigation can be conducted appropriately. However, the performance of mitigation system itself is highly determined by its accuracy in classification of such ferroresonance signals. This paper dealt with the application of wavelet cumulative energy as input of artificial neural network (ANN), that was feed-forward backpropagation network. Ferroresonance was initiated by varying grading capacitance of circuit breaker and switching operations. The fifth order of daubechies wavelet transform up to nine levels was applied to the secondary voltage of transformer. The detail signal at ninth level decomposition was then calculated its cumulative energy for the input of ANN. The ninth level detail signal and its cumulative energy showed that the ferroresonance signals were clearly distinguished between opened single-phase, opened two-phases, and opened three-phases. The ANN output also performed the satisfactory classification result.","doi":"10.1109/ICHVEPS.2017.8225877","startPage":"394","endPage":"399","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Power Systems (ICHVEPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHVEPS.2017.8225877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225853","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Power Systems (ICHVEPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187164/8225853/08225877.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of wavelet cumulative energy and artificial neural network for classification of ferroresonance signal during symmetrical and unsymmetrical switching of three-phases distribution transformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225877/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of wavelet cumulative energy and artificial neural network for classification of ferroresonance signal during symmetrical and unsymmetrical switching of three-phases distribution transformer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8225877/","accessionNumber":"17451658","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of wavelet cumulative energy and artificial neural network for classification of ferroresonance signal during symmetrical and unsymmetrical switching of three-phases distribution transformer","confLoc":"Denpasar, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ts115p59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072635S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187164","isNumber":"8225853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187164","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8225853","articleId":"8225877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8225994,"authors":[{"name":"Harsh Rawat","affiliation":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Harsh","lastName":"Rawat","id":"37085365229"},{"name":"K.

These techniques require heterogeneous and multi-core processors because of their complex computation abilities. Dual-port memories have become an essential component of CPUs because multi-core processors require significant data transfer. However, dual-port memories come at a cost of increased area and leakage. In this paper, an ultra-high-density dual-port SRAM (RADPUHD) architecture is proposed which addresses area and leakage challenges. It is designed and fabricated in 16nm technology. This paper presents use of a single-port bitcell to achieve functionality of dual-port SRAM thus improving area efficiency. The use of latches for Port B signals instead of full flip-flops further reduces area. The proposed design is a bolt-on wrapper around a 6T single-port SRAM. This design achieved a memory density of 8.1Mb/mm2 chip area and achieved 53% area savings and approximately 60% leakage savings when compared to an 8T dual-port SRAM that was also fabricated in 16nm. Silicon results show that the proposed circuit is functional down to a minimum operating voltage of 520mV.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225969","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08225996.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2017.8225996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2017.8225996","startPage":"12","endPage":"17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultra high density pseudo dual-port SRAM in 16nm FINFET process for graphics processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8225996/","displayDocTitle":"An ultra high density pseudo dual-port SRAM in 16nm FINFET process for graphics processors","htmlLink":"/document/8225996/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17501830","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultra high density pseudo dual-port SRAM in 16nm FINFET process for graphics processors","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"027AnUltraHighDensityPseudoDualPortSR.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10732S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8225996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8225999,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

The estimation model for pin accessibility in previous researches counts the total number of intersections between each pin and M2 routing tracks. It does not consider the variation of pin accessibility as the spacing between a pin and its neighboring pins and metal wires changes. Besides, it cannot properly deal with the off-grid pin access neither. In this paper, we propose a general model for pin accessibility estimation. In the model, all directions to connect to the boundary of a pin are under estimation. Off-grid pin access is also available. Experimental results show that the reduction rate of minimum area to complete the routing of a circuit can be 7.0% on average. Due to the diminishment of required area for routing, the total number of vias for higher metal layer also decrease under the same area constraint.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE

attractive solution for balancing software flexibility with high performance and energy efficiency of custom hardware modules. Furthermore, the dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) capabilities of modern FPGAs allow virtualizing the available area to support several hardware modules in time sharing, hence making them even more attractive. Such a feature is exploited by the FRED framework, recently proposed to support the development of real-time applications upon such platforms. This paper presents an implementation of the FRED framework for the Linux operating system over the Zynq-7000 platform produced by Xilinx. Design solutions for managing hardware accelerators are first discussed. Then, a software architecture for Linux is presented, which comprises (i) support for shared-memory communication with hardware accelerators, (ii) an improved driver to handle the FPGA reconfiguration and (iii) a scheduler for requests of hardware acceleration. The proposed solution allows exploiting the enormous number of software systems available for Linux (such as drivers, libraries, communication stacks, etc.) and the typical programming flexibility of software, while relying on predictable hardware acceleration of heavy computations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451077","htmlLink":"/document/8226015/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Linux-based support for developing real-time applications on heterogeneous platforms with dynamic FPGA reconfiguration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linux-based support for developing real-time applications on heterogeneous platforms with dynamic FPGA reconfiguration","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"046ALinuxbasedSupportForDevelopingReal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059162S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8226015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8226019,"authors":[{"name":"Nisha Jacob","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nisha","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37086072379"},{"name":"Jakob Wittmann","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Wittmann","id":"37086293457"},{"name":"Johann Heyszl","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Heyszl","id":"37546348100"},{"name":"Robert Hesselbarth","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hesselbarth","id":"37085889112"},{"name":"Florian Wilde","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Wilde","id":"37085469550"},{"name":"Michael Pehl","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Pehl","id":"37394255500"},{"name":"Georg Sigl","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany","Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Sigl","id":"37389947600"},{"name":"Kai Fischer","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Corporate Technology, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Fischer","id":"38474101700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4034-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4035-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"8226019","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing FPGA SoC configurations independent of their manufacturers","abstract":"System-on-Chips which include FPGAs are important platforms for critical applications since they provide significant software performance through multi-core CPUs as well as high versatility through integrated FPGAs. Those integrated FP-GAs allow to update the programmable hardware functionality, e.g. to include new communication interfaces or to update cryptographic accelerators during the life-time of devices. Updating software as well as hardware configuration is required for critical applications such as e.g. industrial control devices or vehicles with long life-times. Such updates must be authenticated and possibly encrypted. One way to achieve this is to rely on static FPGA manufacturer-provided cryptography and respective master keys. However, in this contribution, we show how to retrofit Xilinx Zynq FPGAs with an alternative cryptographic accelerator and how to establish device-individual keys using Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology. These two key aspects reduce the required trust in manufacturer-provided security features while increasing the security by binding configurations to a specific device.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08226019.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference

In this paper, we propose novel systolic and fully pipelined architecture for convolution layer which can scale to a high performance at a very low area. The architecture is based on innovative techniques namely vector outer product and intelligent data feeder to enable 3 levels of parallelism namely data values, outputs and inputs along with pipelining of compute elements with data movements. The proposed architecture is scalable to provide processing throughput of 64/256/512/1024 Multiplies and Add (MAC) per cycle.

We observe that the cost of network-on-chip designs can be reduced by optimizing the application-specific traffic onto the system. This paper presents mincostflow-based heuristic algorithm (LINCA) that minimizes the quantification of hybrid routers corresponding to the application-specific traffic for manycore systems. LINCA guarantees the performance of hybrid networks on chip. Its results are validated against the manycore system architecture. Our evaluations show that LINCA can reduce significant cost of using hybrid routers in the manycore systems. It reduces cost by 84 percent on average across a variety of applications, compared with all of hybrid routers being deployed in the network without using optimization model.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226033","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08226033.pdf","startPage":"184","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the heterogeneous network on-chip design in manycore architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226033/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the heterogeneous network on-chip design in manycore architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451080","htmlLink":"/document/8226033/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the heterogeneous network on-chip design in manycore architectures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"064OptimizingtheHeterogeneousNetworkOnC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056481S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8226033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226043,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamadhadi Habibzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, SUNY Albany, Albany, NY"],"firstName":"Mohamadhadi","lastName":"Habibzadeh","id":"37086007045"},{"name":"Moeen Hassanalieragh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY"],"firstName":"Moeen","lastName":"Hassanalieragh","id":"37085448413"},{"name":"Tolga Soyata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, SUNY Albany, Albany, NY"],"firstName":"Tolga","lastName":"Soyata","id":"37349824600"},{"name":"Gaurav Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37274173200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4034-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4035-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"8226043","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid power systems","Energy harvesting","Switches","Solar panels","Supercapacitors","Wind turbines","Maximum power point trackers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","hybrid power systems","power supplies to apparatus","secondary cells","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-grid medium-power systems","ambient energy harvesting","autonomous field systems","easy power management","low maintenance requirement","rechargeable batteries","energy density challenge","hybrid power sources","complementary power supply characteristics","hybrid harvesting system design","supercapacitor-based harvesters","solar power source","wind power source","embedded hybrid solar/wind system architectures","supercapacitor buffer size","power 10.0 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid energy harvesting","wind power harvesting","embedded systems","solar power harvesting"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supercapacitor-based embedded hybrid solar/wind harvesting system architectures","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225969","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08226043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226043","startPage":"215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226043","abstract":"Off-grid medium-power (1-10 W) systems require either battery-or supercapacitor-based ambient energy harvesting for sustaining their operation. Supercapacitor-based harvesters are advantageous in autonomous field systems due to their extended lifetime, easy power management, and low maintenance requirement; however, they can reach only up to 10% of the energy density of rechargeable batteries. To overcome this energy density challenge, hybrid power sources, such as solar or wind, can be advantageously utilized in harvesting systems. The complementary power supply characteristics of solar and wind can substantially reduce the required supercapacitor buffer size compared with solar-only or wind-only systems. In the literature, no supercapacitor-based hybrid harvesting system design exists for 1-10 W range. In this paper, we develop and experimentally validate three different categories of supercapacitor-based harvesting systems that are capable of simultaneously harvesting solar/wind (hybrid) power sources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17451126","htmlLink":"/document/8226043/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Supercapacitor-based embedded hybrid solar/wind harvesting system architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supercapacitor-based embedded hybrid solar/wind harvesting system architectures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"074SupercapacitorBasedEmbeddedHybridSola.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076098S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8226043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8226046,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Zhuo","affiliation":["College of ISEE, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"37086304201"},{"name":"Bei Yu","affiliation":["Department of CSE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, NT, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086024023"},{"name":"Di Gao","affiliation":["College of ISEE, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086297536"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4034-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4035-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"8226046","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":779},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Semiconductor device modeling","Feature extraction","Adaptation models","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","learning (artificial intelligence)","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-silicon timing tuning","optimization","iterative learning","bug localization","post-silicon variation extraction","pre-silicon hotspot detection","machine learning techniques","automatic learning","post-silicon validation","pre-silicon verification","modern chip designs","size 22.0 nm"]}],"abstract":"At sub-22nm regime, chip designs have to go through hundreds to thousands of steps and tasks before shipment. Many tasks are data and simulation intensive, thereby demanding significant amount of resources and time. Unlike conventional methodologies relying on experiences to manually handle data and extract models, recent advances in machine learning techniques enable the successful applications in various complex tasks to accelerate modern chip designs, ranging from pre-silicon verification to post-silicon validation and tuning. The goals are to reduce the amount of time and efforts to process and understand data through automatic and effective learning and enhancing from examples.

With the significantly reduced noise margin, therefore, it is no longer possible to fully assure power integrity at design time. As a result, designers seek to contain noise violations, commonly known as voltage emergencies, through various runtime techniques. All these techniques require accurate capture of voltage emergencies through noise sensors. Although existing approaches have explored the optimal placement of noise sensors, they all exploited the statistical modeling of noise, which requires a large number of samples in a high-dimensional space. For large scale power grids, these techniques may not work due to the very long simulation time required to get the samples. In this paper, we explore a novel approach based on generative adversarial network (GAN), which only requires a small number of samples to train. Experimental results show that compared with a simple heuristic which takes in the same number of samples, our approach can reduce the miss rate of voltage emergency detection by up to 65.3% on an industrial design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226048/","accessionNumber":"17451103","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226048/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generative adversarial network based scalable on-chip noise sensor placement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generative adversarial network based scalable on-chip noise sensor placement","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"079GenerativeAdversarialNetworkBasedScal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064869S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8226048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8226051,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunjong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunjong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085665346"},{"name":"Yujin Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Yujin","lastName":"Park","id":"37085658999"},{"name":"Han Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085666133"},{"name":"Suhwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Suhwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279281600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4034-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4035-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"8226051","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Gain","Electronics packaging","Capacitors","Power demand","Operational amplifiers","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","operational amplifiers","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable-gain amplifier","constant bandwidth switched-capacitor","adaptive Miller compensation technique","low power consumption","post-layout simulation","CMOS process","voltage 1.8 V","size 0.18 mum","power 2.8 mW","voltage 3.3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switched-capacitor programmable-gain amplifier (SC-PGA)","low power PGA","Miller compensation capacitor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226051","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225969","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08226051.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A constant bandwidth switched-capacitor programmable-gain amplifier utilizing adaptive miller compensation technique","abstract":"This paper presents a constant bandwidth switched-capacitor programmable-gain amplifier (SC-PGA).

This paper presents a bio-inspired error tolerance framework and three design principles based on the Autonomous Error Tolerant (AET) architecture. A nearby error perception mechanism is carefully designed to detect faults and an initiative evolutions strategy is studied to handle unrecoverable errors. A circuit backup mechanism is proposed for generating an effective way by setting the routing rules to bypass the failed link or node to achieve fault tolerance capabilities. The print circuit board (PCB) prototype is designed and implemented based on a reconfigurable and scalable control-centric dual-core embedded processor (ReSC). Different testing programs associating fault-detection or self-backup schemes and routing algorithms are explored in the platform. Experimental results show that error perceptron can detect the faults and reassign the task for other remaining free and healthy AET cell through Network-on-chip (NoC) when faults occur at the AET cell. The system can complete error recovery within 3 seconds, the paper shows the error-tolerant capability of the proposed architecture is better than the conventional multi-modular redundant system.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226057","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08226057.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing bio-inspired autonomous error-tolerant massively parallel computing architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226057/","displayDocTitle":"Designing bio-inspired autonomous error-tolerant massively parallel computing architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451105","htmlLink":"/document/8226057/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing bio-inspired autonomous error-tolerant massively parallel computing architectures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"088DesigningBioinspiredAutonomousErrorT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062966S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8226057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226058,"authors":[{"name":"Hantao Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hantao","lastName":"Huang","id":"38237440800"},{"name":"Leibin Ni","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Leibin","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085530946"},{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275013000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4034-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4035-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"8226058","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Tensile stress","Three-dimensional displays","Training","Computer architecture","Quantization (signal)","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","random-access storage","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensorized formulation","3D CMOS-RRAM based accelerator","CMOS-ASIC implementation","uncompressed neural network","tensorization","energy-efficient machine learning accelerator","layer-wise tensorized neural network","energy efficient machine learning","LTNN","MNIST benchmark"]}],"abstract":"An energy efficient machine learning requires an effective construction of neural network during training.

With Moore's law showing its limits, new hardware design and programming techniques emerge to pursue energy scaling. Among these, approximate computing is certainly the most popular in current works. It has been shown that reducing precision using software techniques can show significant energy savings on commercially available processors. In this paper, an energy model based on Energy Per Instruction (EPI) has been built in order to understand which mechanisms enable those savings. EPIs of various instructions have been measured and data movement has been identified as being the major consumer. The energy model has been evaluated on a computationally intensive Newton method for solving nonlinear equations using double-precision and single-precision floating-point data types. For all the cases, the model predicts the consumption with less than 10 % error. The energy breakdown reveals that arithmetic operations consume less than 6 % of the total energy and that savings are mainly achieved by reducing the amount of data transferred between registers, cache and main memory. With these conclusions, implementing approximate arithmetic circuits in this type of architecture would have a very limited impact on the consumption. It is however shown that specialized hardware implemented on an FPGA interconnected with a processing system can lead to an additional 20 % energy savings on the Newton method using the same single-precision data type.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170502/8225969/08226072.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"339","publicationTitle":"2017 30th IEEE International System-on-Chip Conference (SOCC)","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2017.8226072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8225969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on the energy-precision tradeoffs on commercially available processors and SoCs with an EPI based energy model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy measurement","Convergence","Energy consumption","Program processors","Mathematical model","Newton method","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","Newton method","nonlinear equations","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-precision data type","energy-precision tradeoffs","commercially available processors","EPI based energy model","energy scaling","software techniques","computationally intensive Newton method","energy breakdown","energy-efficiency","energy per instruction","SoC","Moore law","nonlinear equations","double-precision floating-point data","single-precision floating-point data","arithmetic circuits","FPGA interconnection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A study on the energy-precision tradeoffs on commercially available processors and SoCs with an EPI based energy model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226072/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451113","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the energy-precision tradeoffs on commercially available processors and SoCs with an EPI based energy model","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"103Astudyontheenergyprecisiontradeoffs.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056709S","chronDate":"5-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170502","isNumber":"8225969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170502","xplore-issue":"8225969","articleId":"8226072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226074,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Praveen Kadiyala","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Sai Praveen","lastName":"Kadiyala"},{"name":"Vikram Kumar Pudi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Vikram Kumar","lastName":"Pudi","id":"37064529000"},{"name":"Siew-Kei Lam","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siew-Kei","lastName":"Lam","id":"37332707100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4034-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4035-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"8226074","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","compressed sensing","data compression","image coding","matrix algebra","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","lightweight image compression solutions","inexact computing","hardware architectures","hardware-efficient image compression architecture","library based pruning","approximate compression architecture","baseline architecture","Gaussian Random matrix based compression","multiobjective optimization method","minimal PSNR degradation"]}],"abstract":"Recently, compressive sensing has attracted a lot of research interest due to its potential for realizing lightweight image compression solutions.

In our work, we present a novel method for compressive sensing using approximate computing paradigm, in order to realize a hardware-efficient image compression architecture. We adopt Gaussian Random matrix based compression in our work. Library based pruning is used to realize the approximate compression architecture. Further we present a multi-objective optimization method to fine tune our pruning and increase performance of architecture.

Majority of these deaths worldwide can be attributed to various medical conditions out of which three are very significant: birth asphyxia, preterm and infections. Birth asphyxia (perinatal asphyxia) is a medical condition which is characterised by abnormal breathing patterns in a newborn child which may eventually lead to irrevocable damage to the brain or if neglected can prove to be fatal. In most cases, the condition is diagnosed after the newborn has suffered considerable damage. This is because birth asphyxia can be conclusively determined only by medical examinations by skilled people who are not easily available in poor areas. In this paper, we aimed at such sections of the society and have tried to build up on a machine learning approach by which asphyxia can be determined at its early stages. It involves diagnosing the condition by observing patterns in the child's cry and subjecting it through different layers of a neural network built on a database of previously recorded samples of affected children. The software used is NVIDIA DIGITS and the highest sustained accuracy achieved by us is 94%. It is an economic method which does not require highly skilled labour and can be adopted in almost all sections of the society if adequate resources are available.","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226127","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168943/8226083/08226127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226083","startPage":"236","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of asphyxia in newborns using gpu for deep learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification of asphyxia in newborns using gpu for deep learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226127/","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17449297","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8226127/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of asphyxia in newborns using gpu for deep learning","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2017Paper0272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043928S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168943","isNumber":"8226083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168943","xplore-issue":"8226083","articleId":"8226127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226130,"authors":[{"name":"Satyanarayan.

This implements an evolved node base station (eNB). The Integrated eNB's in 4G network are responsible for seamless switching between different technologies and channels. Such a switching decision is often affected by several parameters like available bandwidth, desired load, inter channel interference, available signal to noise ratio, fading, downlink power and so on. Regular switching between channels result in waste of a portion of bandwidth in control signal whereas delayed switching results in low packet delivery ratio and in turn low data rate. Hence, an optimal solution is desired to maintain high data rate under scalable 4G network. In this work, we propose an optimal resource allocation and power allocation using a Feed Forward Neural Network based machine learning framework for channel condition classification. The system is trained with probe packets under controlled conditions. The eNB nodes then manage the channel resources based on resource constraints during communication of performance parameters. Results shows that the proposed system improves effective data rate and packet delivery ratio in comparison with conventional linear techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226130/","accessionNumber":"17449393","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226130/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network based resource allocation scheme for 4G LTE heterogeneous network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based resource allocation scheme for 4G LTE heterogeneous network","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2017Paper0288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122351S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168943","isNumber":"8226083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168943","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8226083","articleId":"8226130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8226133,"authors":[{"name":"Priyanka Chauhan","affiliation":["U. & P.

In this work, we created a small database of vessels to analyse different aspects of CNN for recognizing the types of marine vessels in sail. A huge network like CNN may possibly be over fitted due to lack of data.

OTP will be sent to the registered email-id or at the mobile number given. With The help of AES (advance encryption standard) algorithm the data will be encrypt and store at database server. 2) Hand Gesture Recognition:-This is second level in which user has to place this hand in front of camera. So camera can detect it, select one point out of 22 points on the hand whatever pattern user make in front of camera is saved as password at user's database. 3) Face Recognition:-This is last level in which user has to place face in front of camera.

As compared to other biometric technologies, iris recognition is prone to poor image quality. Specially, images captured from a distance introduce noises such as blur, off axis, specular reflections and occlusions. For proper recognition good quality of captured image is mandatory and hence sometimes denoising is required. The approach discussed in the paper uses deep neural network for eliminating the unwanted patches affecting the performance of iris recognition systems. The proposed model uses upsampled indices at the decoder stage which is memory efficient. The experimental analysis is performed using Ubiris V.2 database.","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168943/8226083/08226190.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iris segmentation using deep neural networks","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2017","displayDocTitle":"Iris segmentation using deep neural networks","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17449257","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8226190/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iris segmentation using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2017Paper0505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054567S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168943","isNumber":"8226083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168943","xplore-issue":"8226083","articleId":"8226190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226197,"authors":[{"name":"M Rahul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kozhikode, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Rahul","id":"37086306935"},{"name":"B Abhiram Vishnu","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"B Abhiram","lastName":"Vishnu"},{"name":"T Pranav","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kozhikode, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"T","lastName":"Pranav","id":"37086306946"},{"name":"Nandu C Reghu","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"Nandu C","lastName":"Reghu"},{"name":"S J Mija","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kozhikode, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"S J","lastName":"Mija","id":"37085358703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4307-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4308-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8226197","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Mobile robots","Manipulators","Haptic interfaces","Kinematics","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","drives","haptic interfaces","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","service robots","telerobotics","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential drive","haptic robot","tele-operation","semiautonomous system","remote location","Omni Bundle haptic device","Q-Bot 2 Mobile Robot","master-slave configuration","trajectory tracking controller","communication algorithm","remote control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tele-operation","PID","Trajectory Tracking","Kinematics","Master","Slave"]}],"abstract":"Tele-operation is a kind of semi-autonomous system, with the objective of allowing human to control a device in remote location.

Binary de Bruijn sequences are relatively new to spread spectrum technology, but have high cardinality and optimal correlation properties, making them ideal contenders for being robust and secure spreading codes. The outage performance of such binary de Bruijn-based sequences is considered on a downlink MIMO MC-CDMA channel for high user density scenarios at low-load and full-load conditions and compared to Walsh-Hadamard codes of equivalent length. Analysis of simulation results suggest that the proposed de Bruijn sequence based spreading codes achieve improved outage performance than Walsh-Hadamard codes, especially in low-load conditions. This novel approach to spread spectrum codes provides a new dimension to multi-carrier D2D type communications having high user densities.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference

For optimal use of cloud's potential power, effective and efficient algorithm are required, which will select best resources from available cloud resources for different applications. This allocation of user requests to the cloud resource can optimize various parameters like energy consumption, makespan, throughput, etc. This task allocation or mapping problem is a well-known NP-Complete problem. In this paper, we have proposed an algorithm, Task Based allocation to minimize the makespan of the cloud system and also to increase the resource utilization. We have simulated our algorithm, TBA in CloudSim Simulator in a heterogeneous environment. CloudSim is one of the simulation tools of cloud environment which provides evaluation and testing of cloud services and infrastructure before the development of the real world. During the comparison of the algorithm, we provide the sorted tasks to the TBA algorithm once and un-sorted tasks in the second time. We have compared sorted-TBA, unsorted-TBA and random algorithm where the sorted-TBA algorithm performs better.","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168943/8226083/08226222.pdf","startPage":"715","endPage":"720","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226222","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time efficient task allocation in cloud computing environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time efficient task allocation in cloud computing environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226222/","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8226222/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17449370","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time efficient task allocation in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2017Paper0600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141277S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168943","isNumber":"8226083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168943","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8226083","articleId":"8226222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226224,"authors":[{"name":"Rajan Singh","affiliation":["Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Rajan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086284599"},{"name":"Deepak Karia","affiliation":["Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Karia","id":"37402033100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4307-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4308-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8226224","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","microstrip lines","MIMO communication","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feed line","return loss","resonant frequency","mutual coupling","UWB frequency range","gain variation","frequency band","FR4 substrate","microstrip line","high gain compact ultrawide band microstrip MIMO antenna","fabricated prototype MIMO antenna","Non Line Of Sight communication","noise figure -15.0 dB","noise figure 42.0 dB","noise figure 26.0 dB","noise figure 2.0 dB","resistance 50 ohm","bandwidth 7.0 GHz to 8.5 GHz","bandwidth 6.25 GHz to 6.8 GHz","gain 8.2 dB","gain 2.0 dB to 5.0 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Antenna","High Gain","Good Isolation","UWB"]}],"abstract":"A High Gain compact ultra-wide band (UWB) microstrip MIMO antenna with fork shaped geometry is proposed. A C-slot is designed near to the feed line to provide a perfect match between return loss and isolation at the resonant frequency. Finally we achieved the Return loss(S11) of -42dB and mutual coupling is about -26dB respectively. A trade off is maintained between the bandwidth and the Gain of the Antenna to get rid of the problem of Non Line Of Sight communication in the UWB frequency range. The proposed antenna having partial ground plane having chair like structure is fabricated on a low cost FR4 substrate having dimensions 50 (Lsub) X 39 (Wsub) X 1.6 (h) mm3 and is fed by a 50\u03a9 microstrip line. The results show that the proposed antenna achieves impedance bandwidth (VSWR<;2) from 7 GHz to 8.5 GHz and from 6.25 GHz to 6.8 GHz providing gain of 8.2 dB with a gain variation of less than 2 dB over the frequency band. Also the mutual coupling are below -25 dB and -15 dB respectively. This proves a better tradeoff between Gain and Bandwidth with regards to the MIMO antennas. For most of MIMO antennas gain is very less varying from 2 dB to 5 dB. Moreover the fabricated prototype MIMO antenna results of S11, S21 and Gain are found very similar to the Simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226224","publicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168943/8226083/08226224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I2CT.2017.8226224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226083","startPage":"727","endPage":"732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High gain ultra wide band MIMO antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High gain ultra wide band MIMO antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226224/","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"17449414","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8226224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High gain ultra wide band MIMO antenna","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2017Paper0604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065025S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168943","isNumber":"8226083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168943","xplore-issue":"8226083","articleId":"8226224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226236,"authors":[{"name":"Akshay V.

datacenters using enhanced particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Scheduling continues to be a predominant area of research in computer science, especially with the advent of cloud computing and Internet-scale applications, which require global dissemination and high-availability to meet the variable demand of users from geographically distributed locations. While there are various algorithms which address the problem of scheduling, the issue of assigning compute jobs to servers in cloud data centers is particularly challenging, given its combinatorial nature. Operating systems utilize basic scheduling algorithms such as first fit, worst fit, best fit, round robin, and priority for determining the order in which processes are sent to the central processing unit and memory, disk space and other resources are allocated to be utilized. In datacenters, however, scheduling becomes more difficult due to increased complexity of the infrastructure and time-constraints of cloud platforms in general. Therefore, to address the issue of job scheduling on cloud datacenters, algorithms inspired by the natural world, such as particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, and others have been proposed. In this paper we explore the particle swarm optimization algorithm further, and study the effects of changing the social and cognitive value contributions in the convergence of the algorithm towards a solution. We also implement the na\u00efve scheduling algorithms for the cloud datacenters as well, and perform a comparison with the particle swarm optimization algorithm. All the implementations are done using CloudSim, a simulator for cloud computing platforms, and the results are shown. It can be concluded that the advanced algorithms indeed perform better than the na\u00efve ones; however, the social and cognitive constants do not influence the solution for the particle swarm optimization technique significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226258/","accessionNumber":"17449344","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226258/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Job scheduling in cloud datacenters using enhanced particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Job scheduling in cloud datacenters using enhanced particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"I2CT2017Paper0726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073467S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168943","isNumber":"8226083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168943","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8226083","articleId":"8226258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8226290,"authors":[{"name":"Tourangbam Harishore Singh","affiliation":["ECE department, NIT Manipur, Imphal, India"],"firstName":"Tourangbam Harishore","lastName":"Singh","id":"37086652034"},{"name":"Keisham Pritamdas","affiliation":["ECE department, NIT Manipur Imphal, India"],"firstName":"Keisham","lastName":"Pritamdas","id":"37085772130"},{"name":"Romesh Laishram","affiliation":["ECE department, MIT Imphal, India"],"firstName":"Romesh","lastName":"Laishram","id":"37085643464"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4307-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4308-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8226290","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"abstract":"This paper presents the implementation of the novel FIR filter with the filter architecture using shift and add multiplier.

These benefits can be reflected in reducing economic and social losses to come. Therefore, the optimal design of water management projects frequently involves finding the methods or techniques that generate long sequences of hydrological data. These sequences considered as time series can be used to analyze and optimize the performance of the project designed. In order to cover these requirements, this work presents a new model of the stochastic process applied in problems that involve phenomena of stochastic behavior and periodic characteristics. Two components were used, the first one, a type of recurrent neural network relatively recent introduced in the literature and conceptually simple called ESN (echo state network) as the deterministic component, an interesting feature of ESN is that from certain algebraic properties, training only the output of the network is often sufficient to achieve excellent performance in practical applications. The second part of the model incorporates the uncertainty associated with hydrological processes, the model is finally called ESN-RNN. This model was calibrated with time series of monthly discharge data from four different river basins of MOPEX data set. The performance of ESN-RNN is compared with two feedforward neural networks ANN-1, ANN-2 (with one and two past months respectively) and the Thomas-Fiering model. The results show that the ESN-RNN model provides a promising alternative for simulation purposes, with interesting potential in the context of hydrometeorological resources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226387/","accessionNumber":"17434190","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226387/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stochastic generation and forecasting of monthly hydrometeorological data based on non-traditional neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic generation and forecasting of monthly hydrometeorological data based on non-traditional neural network","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"DSLIOIA18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061538S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171462","isNumber":"8226362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171462","xplore-issue":"8226362","articleId":"8226387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8226393,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Chamas","affiliation":["Polytechnic School National University of Asunci\u00f3n, San Lorenzo, Paraguay"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Chamas","id":"37086275433"},{"name":"Fabio L\u00f3pez-Pires","affiliation":["Itaipu Technological Park National University of Asunci\u00f3n, Hernandarias, Paraguay"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Pires","id":"37085788214"},{"name":"Benjamin Baran","affiliation":["Polytechnic School National University of Asunci\u00f3n, San Lorenzo, Paraguay"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Baran","id":"37351190000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3057-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3058-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8226393","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"Cloud computing providers must support requests for resources in dynamic environments, considering service elasticity and overbooking of physical resources.

To solve the presented formulation, a two-phase optimization scheme is considered, composed by an online incremental VMP phase (iVMP) and an offline VMP reconfiguration (VMPr) phase. An experimental evaluation of five algorithms taking into account 400 different scenarios was performed, considering three VMPr Triggering and two VMPr Recovering methods as well as three VMPr resolution alternatives. Experimental results indicate which algorithm outperformed the other evaluated algorithms, improving the quality of solutions in a scenario-based uncertainty model considering the following evaluation

Services have become essential to the software industry as they provide reusable, remotely-accessible functionality and data, thus accelerating client application development and relieving users from maintaining the consumed services. Since Web Services-particularly their descriptions-must be discovered before being consumed, many discovery approaches based on classic Information Retrieval techniques, which store and process textual service descriptions, have arisen. These discovery approaches are affected by natural language ambiguity, such as synonymy and homonymy. Such issues are known as term mismatch, since descriptions relevant to a keyword-based query can be retrieved only if they share many words. Recently, Word Embeddings emerged and tried to cope with this problem by representing words in a language as vectors in a continuous vector space. An interesting property of these vectors is that two different words with similar meaning are represented by vectors that are close in the space. Word Embeddings aim at categorising and quantifying words so that semantic relationships can be established through simple vector distance measures. In this paper, we exploit Word Embeddings to find hidden relationships between service descriptions and queries for the case of REST services, a recent alternative to SOAP-oriented services. The results showed improvements over classical service retrieval techniques such as Vector Space Model or Latent Semantic Analysis of up to 20% in Precision, 39% in Recall, 35% in F-Measure and 10% in NDCG.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226362","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XLIII Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171462/8226362/08226444.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Word embeddings for improving REST services discoverability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8226444/","displayDocTitle":"Word embeddings for improving REST services discoverability","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451405","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Word embeddings for improving REST services discoverability","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"Fslisw07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130534S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171462","isNumber":"8226362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171462","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8226362","articleId":"8226444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226447,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique M.

This approach implies the use of multiple antennas at the transmitter. Then, the fundamental aspect revised in this work takes into account that in a single-carrier SM system, the selection of the active transmit antenna according to (part of) the information bits makes it possible to use a single power amplifier (PA) that is switched among the available antennas. On the other hand, in a conventional SM-OFDM system, every antenna needs to be continuously active as the index information is typically different for each subcarrier. Consequently, we propose a transmission scheme that precodes the information symbols in frequency domain, such that the global symbol period is split into partitions that enable a sequential operation of antennas which can be fed by a single PA. In addition, it is possible to establish that the proposed approach tends to be more robust against disturbances observed in high mobility environments.","doi":"10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226447","publicationTitle":"2017 XLIII Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XLIII Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171462/8226362/08226447.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method to shorten signals in SM-OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226447/","displayDocTitle":"A method to shorten signals in SM-OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451387","htmlLink":"/document/8226447/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method to shorten signals in SM-OFDM","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"CSLIHS02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088139S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171462","isNumber":"8226362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171462","xplore-issue":"8226362","articleId":"8226447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226467,"authors":[{"name":"Leandro D.

The key issue is to define a criterion in order to rank the features, discarding those features that are less relevant, redundant, or noisy. This depends on the particular task, the classifier and the properties of the data. A frequent approach consists on the use of genetic algorithms guided by the classification accuracy. However they are often not able to provide a solution with both a considerable reduction of dimensionality and high accuracy rate. Here we propose a modified version of a genetic algorithm, introducing a novel local improvement approach based on evolution, which is able to obtain better dimensionality-accuracy trade-off. Experimental results on different well known datasets show the advantages of our proposal.","doi":"10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226467","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2017 XLIII Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226362","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 XLIII Latin American Computer Conference (CLEI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8171462/8226362/08226467.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary local improvement on genetic algorithms for feature selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226467/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary local improvement on genetic algorithms for feature selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226467/","accessionNumber":"17451326","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary local improvement on genetic algorithms for feature selection","confLoc":"Cordoba, Argentina","sourcePdf":"DSLIOIA01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085692S","chronDate":"4-8 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8171462","isNumber":"8226362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8171462","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8226362","articleId":"8226467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8226500,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen M.

Explicit expressions are given for all the principal components of audio distortion, for a general audio input signal; the specific example of a sinusoidal input is also discussed in some detail, yielding an explicit closed-form expression for the total harmonic distortion. A class-D amplifier works by converting a low-frequency audio input signal to a high-frequency train of rectangular pulses, whose widths are slowly modulated according to the audio signal. The audio-frequency components of the pulse-train are designed to agree with those of the audio signal. In many varieties of class-D amplifier, the pulse-train is generated using a carrier wave of fixed frequency, well above the audio range. In other varieties, as here, there is no such fixed-frequency clock, and the local frequency of the pulse-train varies in response to the audio input. Such self-oscillating designs pose a particular challenge for comprehensive mathematical modelling; we show that in order to properly account for the local frequency variations, a warped-time transformation is necessary. The systematic nature of our calculation means it can potentially be applied to a range of other self-oscillating topologies. Our results for a general input allow ready calculation of distortion diagnostics such as the intermodulation distortion, which prior analyses, based on sinusoidal input, cannot provide.","doi":"10.1093/imamat/hxw053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imamat/hxw053","startPage":"355","endPage":"370","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016796/8226495/08226500.pdf","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8226495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a hysteresis-controlled self-oscillating class-D amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a hysteresis-controlled self-oscillating class-D amplifier","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","volume":"82","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226500/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a hysteresis-controlled self-oscillating class-D amplifier","sourcePdf":"hxw053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025421S","chronDate":"April  2017","isNumber":"8226495","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016796","articleId":"8226500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8226680,"authors":[{"name":"Linda Meylani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia","School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Linda","lastName":"Meylani","id":"37085679836"},{"name":"Adit Kurniawan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Adit","lastName":"Kurniawan","id":"37393324400"},{"name":"M.

Higher frequencies above 10 GHz are risky because of fading which to overcome it requires MIMO antenna system. This paper presents the design of MIMO microstrip antennas with 8 elements placed in base station. Each element is a two rectangular patches microstrip array with an H-shape slot and insert feed. The material used is Duroid Rogers 5880 with relative dielectric permittivity of 2.2 in 1.575 mm substrate, and the conductor is 35 \u03bcm thickness of copper for radiator and ground plane. The measurement of realized antenna results VSWR > 1.5 or return loss <; -14 dB in the range of 14.50 to 15.25 GHz, the gain is 9.61 dB with elliptical polarization and unidirectional radiation pattern.

Offloading big data to the MEC server for preprocessing is an attractive approach of MDs. In this paper, we investigate data offloading from MDs to MEC servers, and a coalitional game-based pricing scheme is proposed. We apply coalitions to arrange data offloading of MDs as well as depict the offloading relationship between MDs and MEC servers. Furthermore, pricing is utilized as the stimuli for the offloading. In the proposed scheme, a scheduled MD in a coalition chooses an MEC server within the same coalition for offloading, and pays the selected MEC server for the MEC service. By analyzing the formulated coalitional non-transferable utility game, theoretical properties are derived and sufficient conditions for the core existence are given. Finally, the utility performances of the proposed scheme are demonstrated by numerical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","accessionNumber":"17542753","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226751/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing: A Coalition and Pricing Based Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003091","fundingName":"Research Fund for Excellent Young and Middle-aged Scientists of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"BS2015DX011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601269"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003091","fundingName":"Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"J15LN27"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing: A Coalition and Pricing Based Approach","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2785265-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082251S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8226751","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226753,"authors":[{"name":"Amjad Iqbal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, CECOS University of IT and Emerging Sciences, Peshawar, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8226753/iqbal-2785232-small.gif","p":["Amjad Iqbal received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical (telecommunication) engineering from the COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2012.

The growing ubiquity of the network stirred expectations to determine the location of the mobile devices themselves. Since the beginning of standardization, each cellular mobile radio generation has been designed for communication services, and satellite navigation systems, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), have provided precise localization as an add-on service to the mobile terminal. Self-contained localization services relying on the mobile network elements have offered only rough position estimates. Moreover, satellite-based technologies suffer a severe degradation of their localization performance in indoors and urban areas. Therefore, only in subsequent cellular standard releases, more accurate cellular-based location methods have been considered to accommodate more challenging localization services. This survey provides an overview of the evolution of the various localization methods that were standardized from the first to the fourth generation of cellular mobile radio, and looks over what can be expected with the new radio and network aspects for the upcoming generation of fifth generation.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2785181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8362823/08226757.pdf","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8362823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2785181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey of Cellular Mobile Radio Localization Methods: From 1G to 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2018","displayDocTitle":"Survey of Cellular Mobile Radio Localization Methods: From 1G to 5G","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226757/","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17829224","htmlLink":"/document/8226757/","volume":"20","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000844","fundingName":"ESA NPI Programme","grantNumber":"4000110780/14/NL/AK"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Project","grantNumber":"TEC2014-53656-R and TEC2017-89925-R"},{"fundingName":"EU Project High Precision Positioning for Cooperative ITS Applications","grantNumber":"MG-3.5a-2014-636537"},{"fundingName":"Framework of the ICT Project WHERE2 through the European Union FP7","grantNumber":"ICT-248894"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of Cellular Mobile Radio Localization Methods: From 1G to 5G","sourcePdf":"comst-delperalrosado-2785181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227865S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8362823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"8362823","articleId":"8226757","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226767,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8246756/8226767/liu-2785279-small.gif","p":["Jun Liu received the B.Eng. degree from Central South University, China, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree from Fudan University, China, in 2014.

Recently, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown promising performance in this task due to their strengths in modeling the dependencies and dynamics in sequential data. As not all skeletal joints are informative for action recognition, and the irrelevant joints often bring noise which can degrade the performance, we need to pay more attention to the informative ones. However, the original LSTM network does not have explicit attention ability. In this paper, we propose a new class of LSTM network, global context-aware attention LSTM, for skeleton-based action recognition, which is capable of selectively focusing on the informative joints in each frame by using a global context memory cell. To further improve the attention capability, we also introduce a recurrent attention mechanism, with which the attention performance of our network can be enhanced progressively. Besides, a two-stream framework, which leverages coarse-grained attention and fine-grained attention, is also introduced. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging datasets for skeleton-based action recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17485813","pubMedId":"29324413","htmlLink":"/document/8226767/","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition With Global Context-Aware Attention LSTM Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation, Singapore, through the Interactive Digital Media Strategic Research Programme"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1611461 and 61661146005"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1001501"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition With Global Context-Aware Attention LSTM Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-2785279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139627S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8246756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"8246756","articleId":"8226767","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8226768,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Luo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8454923/8226768/luo-2785321-small.gif","p":["Yi Luo was born in Hubei, China, in 1991.

Second, the parameters of three-level multiply connected Bayesian network (TLBN) are studied from statistical data and Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the classification is determined by computing the posterior marginal probabilities of each event given observed evidences.

With the realization of practical memristors, more and more researchers start to investigate MNNs, and their synchronization problem has became a hot topic. However, the majority of the existing works are based on the strict condition that the weights of MNNs are known and determined. When the parameters are unknown, the obtained results may be inapplicable. Thus, it is worthwhile to investigate the synchronization problem of the delayed MNNs with unknown parameters. Due to the parameter uncertainties of MNNs, a novel response system and an adaptive control method are proposed under different assumptions. The update laws for weights in the response system and the gains of adaptive controllers are developed to synchronize the proposed response system with the delayed MNNs. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be applied to various cases and the corresponding stability theories are established. Finally, the numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19280312","volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8226769/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Synchronization of Delayed Memristive Neural Networks With Unknown Parameters","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503377, 61533017 and U1501251"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Synchronization of Delayed Memristive Neural Networks With Unknown Parameters","sourcePdf":"tsmc-luo-2778092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110546S","chronDate":"Feb.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8960489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8960489","articleId":"8226769","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8226772,"authors":[{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Networks and Cloud Computing Security of Universities in Chongqing, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7511293/8360432/8226772/zhang-2785245-small.gif","p":["Jiliang Zhang received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University in 2011.

Both S and Rs are assumed to be with nonlinear energy harvesters, and harvest energy from radio-frequency signals from B through a time-switching harvesting scheme. Assuming Rs deploy decode-and-forward scheme, a general Kth best relay in terms of instantaneous secrecy capacity for S-R-D link is selected for information transmission. An analytical expression for secrecy outage probability (SOP), validated via Monte Carlo simulation, is derived when all channels experience independent Rayleigh fading. Numerical results show that a higher correlation coefficient between the estimated and real channel values leads to better SOP performance when the ratio of the channel gains of R-D and R-E links is in the high region for the first hop or in the low-to-medium region for the second hop. Furthermore, there exists a special value of the saturation threshold of the energy harvester at S or R, and SOP performance cannot be improved when the saturation threshold is beyond that value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226772/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17768608","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226772/","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Analysis of Wireless-Powered Multi-Antenna Relaying System With Nonlinear Energy Harvesters and Imperfect CSI","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA016304"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of CQ CSTC","grantNumber":"cstc2016jcyjA2002"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"XDJK2016A011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Analysis of Wireless-Powered Multi-Antenna Relaying System With Nonlinear Energy Harvesters and Imperfect CSI","sourcePdf":"tgcn-zhang-2785245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092022S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7511293","isNumber":"8360432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7511293","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8360432","articleId":"8226772","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":8226776,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Qian Yu (S\u201916) is pursuing his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California (USC), Viterbi School of Engineering.

The server has a database of files (content). Each user has an isolated memory that can be used to cache content in a prefetching phase. In a following delivery phase, each user requests a file from the database, and the server needs to deliver users' demands as efficiently as possible by taking into account their cache contents. We focus on an important and commonly used class of prefetching schemes, where the caches are filled with uncoded data. We provide the exact characterization of the rate-memory tradeoff for this problem, by deriving both the minimum average rate (for a uniform file popularity) and the minimum peak rate required on the bottleneck link for a given cache size available at each user. In particular, we propose a novel caching scheme, which strictly improves the state of the art by exploiting commonality among user demands. We then demonstrate the exact optimality of our proposed scheme through a matching converse, by dividing the set of all demands into types, and showing that the placement phase in the proposed caching scheme is universally optimal for all types. Using these techniques, we also fully characterize the rate-memory tradeoff for a decentralized setting, in which users fill out their cache content without any coordination.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2785237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8263292/08226776.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8263292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2785237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Exact Rate-Memory Tradeoff for Caching With Uncoded Prefetching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226776","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8263292/8226776-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"The Exact Rate-Memory Tradeoff for Caching With Uncoded Prefetching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226776/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519194","htmlLink":"/document/8226776/","volume":"64","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1408639 and NETS-1419632"},{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N000141612189"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"The Exact Rate-Memory Tradeoff for Caching With Uncoded Prefetching","sourcePdf":"tit-yu-2785237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125024S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8263292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"8263292","articleId":"8226776","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226779,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng-Guang Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8612989/8226779/wu-2778282-small.gif","p":["Zheng-Guang Wu was born in 1982.

Transformer is utilized rather than the quarter-/half-wavelength lines, and the circuit size can be significantly reduced. The bandwidth of the proposed differential coupler can be enhanced by increasing the coupling coefficient of the transformer. For the proof of concept, the proposed transformer-based 3-dB differential coupler is implemented on the substrate integrated suspended line (SISL) platform. Well agreed simulated and measured results verified the feasibility of the proposed differential coupler. From 0.4 to 0.6 GHz, the measured common-mode suppression is better than 10 dB with a maximum 30 dB, and the measured cross-mode suppression is better than 30 dB. Compared with the previous designs, the self-packaged SISL differential coupler has a much smaller size of 0.08\u03bb0 \u00d7 0.08\u03bb0. The proposed design methodology has advantages of compact size, suppression of both common-mode and cross-mode signals, and controllable bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","volume":"65","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"17801694","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226793/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Transformer-Based 3-dB Differential Coupler","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471092"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61625105"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016Z002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transformer-Based 3-dB Differential Coupler","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ma-2778000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099317S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8369410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8369410","articleId":"8226793","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226794,"authors":[{"name":"Burhan Gulbahar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/8264912/8226794/gulba-2785226-small.gif","p":["Burhan Gulbahar (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2012.

The emissions of fluorescent molecules or direct images of particles are captured with cameras or photodetectors. The current imaging systems have challenges in detection, collection, and analysis of imaging data, penetration depth, and complicated set-ups. In this paper, a signaling-based nanoscale acousto-optic radar and microfluidic multiple particle tracking (MPT) system is proposed based on the theoretical design providing nanoscale optical modulator with vibrating F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer and vibrating cadmium selenide/zinc sulfide quantum dots (QDs) on graphene resonators.

To overcome the variation of resistance and capacitance, a simple on-chip tuning strategy through the calibration of resistor is integrated.

However, in the delay sensitive applications, no useful information can be recovered if a user cannot collect a full set of the encoded packets. This becomes more severe for multicast hard deadline constrained prioritized data because of the delivery time limitation and packet interdependency. Meanwhile, the performance of a multicast network is also limited by its bottleneck user(s) due to the heterogeneity of the underlying physical channels. Accordingly, we propose a cross-layer transmission scheme that utilizes beamforming at physical layer and adaptive RNC (ARNC) at network layer to maximize the overall network throughput. Under this joint-design, a smart antennas array that operates the beamforming is used to dynamically allocate the transmitting power among users, and the ARNC is adopted to achieve the network coding gain. In this way, the performance of each user is well balanced and the overall network throughput is increased observably. Furthermore, we propose a sample-based feedback scheme to reduce the system overhead. The analytical and simulation results are shown that the throughput of the network has increased by 30%~40% under our schemes compared with other RNC-based schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785238","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08226799.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power Allocation and Adaptive Random Network Coding in Wireless Multicast Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power Allocation and Adaptive Random Network Coding in Wireless Multicast Networks","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699081","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226799/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61601365, 61571370, 61701086 and 61271169"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2016JQ6017 and 2015JM6349"},{"fundingName":"National Civil Aircraft Major Project of China","grantNumber":"MIZ-2015-F-009"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102017GX08003 and ZYGX2016KYQD143"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power Allocation and Adaptive Random Network Coding in Wireless Multicast Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-li-2785238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097508S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8226799","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226803,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos G.

For this reason, the design of reserve procurement mechanisms should be reconsidered in order to embed resources that are capable of providing reserve services in an economically optimal way. In this study, a joint energy and reserve day-ahead market structure based on two-stage stochastic programming is presented. The developed model incorporates explicitly the participation of demand side resources in the provision of load following reserves. Since a load that incurs a demand reduction may need to recover this energy in other periods, different types of load recovery requirements are modeled. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the risk associated with the decisions of the system operator and to assess the effect of procuring and compensating load reductions, the Conditional Value-at-Risk metric is employed. In order to solve the resulting multi-objective optimization problem, a new approach based on an improved variant of the epsilon-constraint method is adopted. This study demonstrates that the proposed approach to risk management presents conceptual advantages over the commonly used weighted sum method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2785266","startPage":"3940","endPage":"3954","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

on Location Accuracy for the Binocular Stereo Vision System","abstract":"Binocular stereo vision (BSV) system has been widely used in various fields, such as intelligent manufacture, smart robot, and so on. However, the location accuracy of the current BSV still cannot fully satisfy industry requirements due to lack of a parameters optimization BSV system. In this paper, a high accuracy BSV system is proposed. This is achieved through analyzing the seven parameters of the BSV system, which are classified into two groups: system structure parameters (SSPs) and camera calibration parameters (CCPs). For the SSPs, an improved analysis model is designed to expose the possible errors caused by three parameters. Furthermore, a new correlation model among them is also proposed to analyze the errors caused by their correlation. On the other hand, for the CCPs, the orthogonal experiment model is employed for selecting the optimal combination of the four calibration parameters. Meanwhile, the weight among the four parameters is also analyzed for reducing errors. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated by a large number of experiments. It gives a useful reference to the BSV system used in applied optics research and application fields.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","externalId":"7800316","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226805/","impactStatement":"In this paper, analysis models were designed to expose the possible errors caused by three important parameters for Binocular Stereo Vision (BSV) system.

However, the effective power of such guard period depends in practice on the bandwidth allocation and is still significant in case of small bands. In this letter, we characterize the residual energy of the ZT DFT-s-OFDM guard period and evaluate its impact on spectral containment, non-cyclic inter-symbol interference (ISI) and link performance when small transmission bands are used. Spectral containment is shown not to be affected thanks to the oscillating part of the guard period, which ensures the presence of low power samples in the transition between adjacent time symbols. Despite the larger tail power, link performance is shown to be only marginally affected. This is because small bandwidth configurations experience a nearly flat fading, and therefore minimum non-cyclic ISI over the next symbol.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2017.2784825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8388567/08226806.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2017.2784825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Sensitivity of Zero-Tail DFT-Spread-OFDM to Small Bandwidth Allocations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226806/","displayDocTitle":"On the Sensitivity of Zero-Tail DFT-Spread-OFDM to Small Bandwidth Allocations","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17857680","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226806/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Sensitivity of Zero-Tail DFT-Spread-OFDM to Small Bandwidth Allocations","sourcePdf":"lwc-berardinelli-2784825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044953S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8388567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388567","articleId":"8226806","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8226807,"authors":[{"name":"Eun-Hu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The University of Suwon, Hwaseong, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8478840/8226807/kim-2785244-small.gif","p":["Eun-Hu Kim received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical\n engineering from Suwon University, Hwaseong, South Korea, in 2009, 2011, and 2016, respectively.

The key point of this study is to reduce the computational complexity of type-2 fuzzy set-based models and to alleviate the deterioration of its generalization abilities through the synergistic effect of two algorithms: First, interval type-2 FCM (IT2FCM) is used in the hidden layer of the network and connections (weights) are adjusted by invoking the least squares error estimation method. Second, an L2-norm regularization is considered in the cost function to avoid the construction of the network suffering from overfitting. In more detail, the hidden layer of the proposed FC is realized by interval type-2 FCM clustering to deal with the factor of uncertainty involved in the problem. This type of clustering is realized by using two values of the fuzzification coefficient resulting in the interval type-2 membership functions. Once completing type reduction, the membership grades of IT2FCM are used as the outputs of the hidden layer. Instead of the backpropagation training, least squares estimator based learning is applied to adjust the functional connection being regarded as linear functions mapping the hidden layer to the output layer. In order to reduce potential overfitting, L2-norm regularization is taken into account. The effectiveness of the proposed classifier is analyzed with the aid of a number of machine learning datasets as well as face image datasets. Thorough comparative studies are also included.","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8478840/08226807.pdf","startPage":"3054","endPage":"3068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy

Robustness and high identification accuracy with noisy input can be achieved by introducing the bias-compensation term derived from the unbiasedness criterion.

In this setting, time allocations for the downlink transmission of the H-AP and the uplink transmission for the users are jointly optimized for two different purposes. First, the weighted sum-rate maximization problem is solved for a given total transmission time. Then, the total transmission time is minimized under a minimum rate constraint, and an efficient algorithm is also presented to solve the optimal solution by a line search strategy. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly increase the far user's rate, which in turn improves user fairness and transmission delay.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

In particular, we show that this modification typically results in a further decrease of the signal quality factor. This is particularly pronounced in the presence of electrical filters with steep transfer functions such as, e.g., occurring when feeding the signal through an antialiasing filter prior to analog-to-digital conversion or in a real-time oscilloscope, in the latter case leading to counter-intuitive dependencies of the measured signal quality on the characteristics of the test setup. Predictions are exemplified in concrete system models and verified with experiments. While the modeling assumptions and the accuracy of the predictions are in line with models previously reported in the literature, derived expressions allow straightforwardly tying the modification of the level dependent noise to signal levels, baud rate, signal spectrum, and filter transfer functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8233353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2785287","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8233353/08226818.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"16","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2785287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modification of Level Dependent ASE-Signal Beat Noise by Optical and Electrical Filtering in Optically Preamplified Direct Detection Receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Modification of Level Dependent ASE-Signal Beat Noise by Optical and Electrical Filtering in Optically Preamplified Direct Detection Receivers","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8226818/","impactStatement":"We derive compact expressions for the modification of level dependent ASE-signal beat noise due to optical and electrical filtering in direct detection receivers, making dependencies on data rate, filter and signal shapes explicitly apparent.

Unlike most previous works that match the question and each candidate sentence separately, we observe that the context information among sentences in the same passage plays a vital role in this task. We propose modeling context information with hierarchical gated recurrent neural networks. Specifically, we first apply a word level recurrent neural network to model the context independent matching between the question and each candidate sentence. We then employ a sentence level recurrent neural network to incorporate the context information among all candidate sentences. Moreover, we introduce the gate mechanism to select matching information before feeding into recurrent neural networks at both word and sentence level. Experiments on the WikiQA and SQuAD datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2785283","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8253682/08226822.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2785283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-Aware Answer Sentence Selection With Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Context-Aware Answer Sentence Selection With Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17485412","publicationDate":"March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226822/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61421003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-Aware Answer Sentence Selection With Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"taslp-tan-2785283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065859S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8253682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8253682","articleId":"8226822","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8226830,"authors":[{"name":"Man Chu","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8226830/chu-2785319-small.gif","p":["Man Chu received the B.S. degree in information engineering and the master\u2019s degree in electronic and communication engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering.

We adopt the power splitting (PS) relay protocol and the interference alignment (IA) technique to jointly realize energy transfer and interference management. We propose two novel transmission schemes for the SWIPT in relay IC networks, namely, one-stage PS IA scheme and two-stage PS IA scheme. For both schemes, we investigate the optimal PS ratios that maximize the network sum rate. We obtain the closed-form optimal PS ratios for the two-stage PS IA scheme and develop a distributed and iterative algorithm to derive the optimal PS ratios for the one-stage PS IA scheme. We further study the optimal design of the IA precoding and decoding matrices. Based on the Grassmann manifold approach, we present an algorithm to obtain the optimal IA matrices for both schemes. The optimality of the designs of both the PS ratios and the IA matrices is then verified by simulations. Our results show that the proposed schemes effectively improve the performance of the network and significantly outperform benchmark schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226830/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","volume":"66","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17699083","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226830/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Power Splitting Relays With Interference Alignment","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Chia (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61461136001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Power Splitting Relays With Interference Alignment","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liao-2785319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146727S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8226830","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226831,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh Hoa Nguyen","affiliation":["International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research and the Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/8388786/8226831/nguye-2785311-small.gif","p":["Dinh Hoa Nguyen (S\u201909\u2013M\u201915) received the Ph.D.\n degree from The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2014.

The consensus speed is significantly improved by introducing an inner control loop for energy levels. The droop frequency/voltage control is also added to regulate the active/reactive power sharing and the frequency/voltage of BESSs. Furthermore, self delays and communication delays are explicitly considered in the design. As a result, the derived consensus algorithms are fully distributed with fast consensus speed in both contexts of nonexistence and existence of time delays, which have not been addressed in the existing research for BESSs.

The sensors are constrained by the limited and unpredictable energy availability provided by energy harvesting (EH), and by the channel impairments. To maximize the quality of the reported data, the packets transmitted contain newly generated data blocks together with up to r -1 previously unsuccessfully delivered ones, where r is a design parameter. These data blocks are compressed, concatenated, and encoded with a channel code. The scheme applies lossy compression, such that the fidelity of the individual blocks is traded off with the reliability provided by the channel code. We show that the proposed strategy outperforms the one in which retransmissions are not allowed. We also investigate the tradeoff between the value of r, the compression and the coding rates, under the constraints of the energy availability, and, once r has been decided, use a Markov decision process (MDP) to optimize the compression/coding rates. Finally, we implement a reinforcement learning algorithm, through which devices can learn the optimal transmission policy without knowing a priori the statistics of the EH process, and show that it indeed reaches the performance obtained via MDP.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785323","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08226832.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Compression, Channel Coding, and Retransmission for Data Fidelity With Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Compression, Channel Coding, and Retransmission for Data Fidelity With Energy Harvesting","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699078","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226832/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Intel\u2019s Corporate Research Council, under the project \u201cEC-CENTRIC: an energy- and context-centric optimization framework for IoT nodes\u201d"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council","grantNumber":"648382"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Compression, Channel Coding, and Retransmission for Data Fidelity With Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tcomm-pielli-2785323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104502S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8226832","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226837,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elkholy","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elkholy","orcid":"0000-0003-1597-7183","id":"37073506100"},{"name":"Sherif Shakib","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sherif","lastName":"Shakib","orcid":"0000-0003-0238-9032","id":"37085422061"},{"name":"Jeremy Dunworth","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Dunworth","orcid":"0000-0001-9347-996X","id":"37085651548"},{"name":"Vladimir Aparin","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Aparin","id":"37268464200"},{"name":"Kamran Entesari","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kamran","lastName":"Entesari","orcid":"0000-0002-7772-6606","id":"37296939000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8226837","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5193},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226837","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Noise measurement","Wideband","OFDM","Linearity","5G mobile communication","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","transceivers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prototype LNA","digitally controlled gain","higher IIP3","maximum group delay flatness","CMOS process","high OIP3","CMOS wideband variable gain LNA","third-order intercept point","integrated phased-array transceivers","5G","frequency 26.0 GHz to 33.0 GHz","noise figure 3.3 dB to 4.3 dB","power 21.5 mW to 31.4 mW","gain 18.0 dB to 26.0 dB","size 40 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","LNA","phased-array transceiver"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a CMOS wideband variable gain LNA for 28-GHz 5G integrated phased-array transceivers preserving high third-order intercept point (OIP3) at all gain settings.

However, RESs are normally coupled to the power grid through fast-response power converters without any inertia, leading to decreased power system inertia. As a result, the grid frequency may easily go beyond the acceptable range under severe frequency events, resulting in undesirable load-shedding, cascading failures, or even large-scale blackouts. To address the ever-decreasing inertia issue, this paper proposes the concept of distributed power system virtual inertia, which can be implemented by grid-connected power converters. Without modifications of system hardware, power system inertia can be emulated by the energy stored in the dc-link capacitors of grid-connected power converters. By regulating the dc-link voltages in proportional to the grid frequency, the dc-link capacitors are aggregated into an extremely large equivalent capacitor serving as an energy buffer for frequency support. Furthermore, the limitation of virtual inertia, together with its design parameters, is identified. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed concept is validated through simulation and experimental results, which indicate that 12.5% and 50% improvements of the frequency nadir and rate of change of frequency can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2785218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8412378/08226839.pdf","startPage":"8488","endPage":"8499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8412378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2785218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Power System Virtual Inertia Implemented by Grid-Connected Power Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Power System Virtual Inertia Implemented by Grid-Connected Power Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226839/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17935450","htmlLink":"/document/8226839/","volume":"33","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore"},{"fundingName":"Energy Programme and administrated by the Energy Market Authority","grantNumber":"NRF2015EWT-EIRP002-007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Distributed Power System Virtual Inertia Implemented by Grid-Connected Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-fang-2785218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106626S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8412378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"8412378","articleId":"8226839","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226843,"authors":[{"name":"Jiyan Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8359223/8226843/wu-2785252-small.gif","p":["Jiyan Wu received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the North China Institute of Science and Technology in 2008, the master\u2019s degree from the China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, in 2014.","He was a Software Developer (C++) with Sinosoft Technologies Company Ltd., Beijing, from 2010 to 2014, and a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, from 2014 to 2016.

Energy efficiency is critical to guarantee the service time and quality of power-intensive video streaming on wireless surveillance systems. In particular, video coding and data communication constitute the majority of power dissipation in embedded multimedia devices driven by capacity-limited batteries. However, the complex power characteristics and time-varying channel status pose crucial challenges on enabling low-power high-quality video streaming. To address these critical problems, this paper presents a power-efficient and network-adaptive (PENA) framework for source- forward error correction (FEC) coding in embedded systems. First, an analytical framework is developed to characterize the rate-distortion-power tradeoff for video encoding and data transfer. Second, a joint rate control and FEC coding solution is proposed to maximize video quality under power constraint. Distinct from the existing source-FEC coding algorithms, PENA is able to effectively leverage the video rate-distortion model and system power features. We conduct the system implementation and performance evaluation with real embedded surveillance devices over wireless networks. Experimental results demonstrate PENA achieves appreciable improvements over the reference source-FEC coding schemes in terms of power conservation, perceived video quality, and end-to-end delay.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2785252","startPage":"2153","endPage":"2168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8359223/08226843.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Source-FEC Coding for Energy-Efficient Surveillance Video Over Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Source-FEC Coding for Energy-Efficient Surveillance Video Over Wireless Networks","volume":"66","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17766423","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8226843/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Hightech R&D Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2013AA102301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Source-FEC Coding for Energy-Efficient Surveillance Video Over Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wu-2785252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126915S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8359223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8359223","articleId":"8226843","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226847,"authors":[{"name":"Ang Li","affiliation":["University College London, London, London, GB"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8226847/li-2782775-small.gif","p":["Ang Li (S\u201914) received the Bachelor's and Master's\n degrees in electronic and information engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011\n and 2014, respectively.

In this paper, we study the multiple-input-multiple-output SWIPT systems with limited RF chains at the base station. We focus on the scenario where there is one information decoder with a target signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio and several separate energy-harvesting receivers with harvested energy thresholds. To motivate our energy-efficient hybrid analog-digital beamforming strategy, the fully digital power minimization problem is first analyzed, where we mathematically show that the optimal beamformer consists of only the information beamformer, and derive closed-form beamformers for a number of special cases. Based on this result, we further consider hybrid beamforming and propose an iterative scheme where the analog and digital beamformers are alternately updated. For the proposed scheme, in each iteration we design the analog beamformer by minimizing the difference between the fully digital beamformer and the hybrid beamformer. Based on our above-mentioned analysis for fully digital case, the optimal solution for the analog beamformer can be obtained via a geometrical interpretation. We further design the robust beamformers for the proposed schemes, when only imperfect channel state information is available. The numerical results show that the proposed iterative designs achieve a close-to-optimal performance with significant gains in the total power consumption over fully digital SWIPT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17699058","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226847/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient SWIPT: From Fully Digital to Hybrid Analog\u2013Digital Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M014150/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficient SWIPT: From Fully Digital to Hybrid Analog\u2013Digital Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2782775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158167S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8226847","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8226850,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Taylor","affiliation":["Program of Media Arts and Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab., Cambridge"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/9103669/8226850/taylo-2784832-small.gif","p":["Sara Taylor received the the BS degree in electrical engineering, the BS degree in mathematics both from the Brigham Young University, and the master's degree in media arts and sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior. We offer the code for this work in open source. These techniques are investigated in the context of predicting future mood, stress, and health using data collected from surveys, wearable sensors, smartphone logs, and the weather. Empirical results demonstrate that using MTL to account for individual differences provides large performance improvements over traditional machine learning methods and provides personalized, actionable insights.","doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2784832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9103669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2784832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/9103669/08226850.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalized Multitask Learning for Predicting Tomorrow's Mood, Stress, and Health","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Personalized Multitask Learning for Predicting Tomorrow's Mood, Stress, and Health","volume":"11","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8226850/","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2020","accessionNumber":"19726534","pubMedId":"32489521","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226850/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MIT Media Lab Consortium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01GM105018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013422","fundingName":"NEC Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalized Multitask Learning for Predicting Tomorrow's Mood, Stress, and Health","sourcePdf":"taffc-taylor-2784832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14349S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"9103669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"9103669","articleId":"8226850","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226852,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Dullien","affiliation":["Google's Project Zero, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/9109372/8226852/dulli-2785299-small.gif","p":["THOMAS DULLIEN has worked in exploitation, reverse engineering, and vulnerability research since the late 1990s.

Yet, in spite of the centrality of the concept and voluminous descriptions of various exploitation techniques or countermeasures, a good theoretical framework for describing and reasoning about exploitation has not yet been put forward. A body of concepts and folk theorems exists in the community of exploitation practitioners; unfortunately, these concepts are rarely written down or made sufficiently precise for people outside of this community to benefit from them. This paper clarifies a number of these concepts, provides a clear definition of exploit, a clear definition of the concept of a weird machine, and how programming of a weird machine leads to exploitation. The papers also shows, somewhat counterintuitively, that it is feasible to design some software in a way that even powerful attackers-with the ability to corrupt memory once-cannot gain an advantage. The approach in this paper is focused on memory corruptions. While it can be applied to many security vulnerabilities introduced by other programming mistakes, it does not address side channel attacks, protocol weaknesses, or security problems that are present by design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226852/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December

Three different metals were utilized as electrodes, Nb, Au, and Pt, for covering a wide range of work function and electronegativity values. Despite their symmetric structure, the devices were found to exhibit asymmetric performance with respect to the applied bias polarity. Clear signature plots indicating thermionic emission over the interface Schottky barriers have been obtained. The asymmetry between the top and the bottom interfaces was further evaluated by the values of the potential barrier heights and by the barrier lowering factors, both calculated from the experimental data. This study highlights the importance of the interface effects and proves that in addition to film doping, proper (top/bottom) metal selection, and interface engineering should also be exploited for developing thin film metal oxide based devices with tailored electrical characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2017.2777698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/8456641/08226854.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2017.2777698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8456641","startPage":"867","endPage":"872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interface Asymmetry Induced by Symmetric Electrodes on Metal\u2013Al:TiO-\u2013Metal Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interface Asymmetry Induced by Symmetric Electrodes on Metal\u2013Al:TiO<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{x}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\u2013Metal Structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18072792","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8226854/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP\\K017829\\1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Interface Asymmetry Induced by Symmetric Electrodes on Metal\u2013Al:TiO<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_{x}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\u2013Metal Structures","sourcePdf":"tnano-michalas-2777698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067122S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8456641","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8456641","articleId":"8226854","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8226855,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Baffelli","affiliation":["Chair of Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8323433/8226855/baffe-2778049-small.gif","p":["Simone Baffelli (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Chair of Earth Observation and Remote Sensing.","His research interests include the use of ground-based radar systems for the mapping of surface displacement, differential interferometry, and the processing and calibration of ground-based radar data."]},"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Baffelli","orcid":"0000-0001-6059-9703","id":"37086352858"},{"name":"Othmar Frey","affiliation":["GAMMA Remote Sensing AG, G\u00fcmligen, Switzerland","Chair of Earth Observation and Remote Sensing, Institute of Environmental Engineering, ETH Zurich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8323433/8226855/frey-2778049-small.gif","p":["Othmar Frey (S\u201904\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201917) received the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in geomatic engineering from ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2002, and the Ph.D. (Dr. sc. nat.) degree (Hons.) in radar remote sensing from the University of Zurich, Zurich, in 2010.","From 2002 to 2010, he was a Research Associate with the Remote Sensing Laboratories, University of Zurich.

The processing of KAPRI data into single look complex images is addressed, including the correction of beam squint and of azimuthal phase variations. A polarimetric calibration model adapted to the acquisition mode is presented and used to produce calibrated polarimetric covariance matrix data. The methods are validated by means of a scene containing five trihedral corner reflectors. Data preprocessing is assessed by analyzing the oversampled response of a corner reflector, and the polarimetric calibration quality is verified by computing polarimetric signatures and residual calibration parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17634345","htmlLink":"/document/8226855/","displayDocTitle":"Polarimetric Calibration of the Ku-Band Advanced Polarimetric Radar Interferometer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarimetric Calibration of the Ku-Band Advanced Polarimetric Radar Interferometer","sourcePdf":"tgrs-baffelli-2778049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139699S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8323433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8323433","articleId":"8226855","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8226863,"authors":[{"name":"Jonas Engels","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven/EnergyVille, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8643651/8226863/engel-2785040-small.gif","p":["Jonas Engels (S\u201916) was born in Lier, Belgium, in 1990.

This paper presents an optimized control strategy that allows a battery to be used simultaneously for self-consumption and primary frequency control. Therein, it addresses two stochastic problems: 1) the delivery of primary frequency control with a battery and 2) the use of the battery for self-consumption. We propose a linear recharging policy to regulate the state of charge of the battery while providing primary frequency control. Formulating this as a chance-constrained problem, we can ensure that the risk of battery constraint violations stays below a predefined probability. We use robust optimization as a safe approximation to the chance-constraints, which allows to make the risk of constraint violation arbitrarily low, while keeping the problem tractable and offering maximum reserve capacity. Simulations with real frequency measurements prove the effectiveness of the designed recharging strategy. We adopt a rule-based policy for self-consumption, which is optimized using stochastic programming. This policy allows to reserve more energy and power of the battery on moments when expected consumption or production is higher, while using other moments for recharging from primary frequency control. We show that optimally combining the two services increases value from batteries significantly.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2785040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8643651/08226863.pdf","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2785040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined Stochastic Optimization of Frequency Control and Self-Consumption With a Battery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8226863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Combined Stochastic Optimization of Frequency Control and Self-Consumption With a Battery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8226863/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18629567","htmlLink":"/document/8226863/","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012331","fundingName":"Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined Stochastic Optimization of Frequency Control and Self-Consumption With a Battery","sourcePdf":"tsg-engels-2785040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092287S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8643651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8643651","articleId":"8226863","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8226985,"authors":[{"name":"Siladitya Dey","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8295182/8226985/dey-2777455-small.gif","p":["Siladitya Dey (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2007, and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, in 2009.

Large-scale urban scenes usually contain a large number of object categories and many overlapped or closely neighboring objects, which poses great challenges for classifying and modeling buildings from these data sets. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a 3-D convolutional neural network, a deep Q-network, and a residual recurrent neural network for the efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3-D point clouds. The proposed framework provides an end-to-end automatic processing method that maps the raw point cloud to the classification results of the given categories. After obtaining the building classes, we utilize an edge-aware resampling algorithm to consolidate the point set with noise-free normals and clean preservation of sharp features. Finally, 2.5-D dual contouring, which is a data-driven approach, is introduced to generate urban building models from the consolidated point clouds. Our method can generate lightweight building models with arbitrarily shaped roofs while preserving the verticality of connecting walls.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and

Due to digital-domain implementation as well as the SAR ADC where the key building blocks are embedded for the proposed DNC, compact size and efficient power consumption could be designed. For low circuit noise, a feedback DAC is implemented with a tri-level current-steering DAC. Tri-level data-weight averaging (TDWA) improves the linearity of the DAC. With the proposed DNC and TDWA, a prototype CT DSM fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS achieves a peak 74.4-dB SNDR and an 80.8-dB dynamic range (DR) for a 10-MHz BW with an oversampling ratio of 16, resulting in a Schreier FoMDR of 174.5 dB.

An ecologically important role of multisensory integration is in scaffolding verbal communication, which relies upon the precise temporal integration of auditory and visual cues. However, the role of (multi)sensory function in supporting another important aspect of communication, namely, nonverbal communication, is unknown. Here, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a group of typically developing (TD) participants performed a simultaneity judgment task to index their audiovisual temporal acuity for speech stimuli. Further, under a naturalistic scenario, nonverbal synchrony between the participant and a na\u00efve experimenter was measured. Automated motion analysis was performed to quantify movements of different body-parts. Results demonstrate a wider window of audiovisual temporal integration for ASD participants in comparison to their TD counterparts. Moreover, ASD individuals performed less complex movements and demonstrated less nonverbal synchrony during the interactive exchange. Lastly, multisensory temporal acuity significantly predicted the synchrony in hand and head movements between TD participants and the experimenter, but not between the ASD participants and the experimenter. Taken together, the results suggest an important role for multisensory perceptual abilities in shaping nonverbal communication between dyads and highlight the important role of perceptual systems in supporting social interactive skills.","doi":"10.1109/TCDS.2017.2778141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274989/8567843/08227001.pdf","startPage":"973","endPage":"982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8567843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2017.2778141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncoupling Between Multisensory Temporal Function and Nonverbal Turn-Taking in Autism Spectrum Disorder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Uncoupling Between Multisensory Temporal Function and Nonverbal Turn-Taking in Autism Spectrum Disorder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227001/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18320949","htmlLink":"/document/8227001/","volume":"10","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"HD083211 and MH109225"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Uncoupling Between Multisensory Temporal Function and Nonverbal Turn-Taking in Autism Spectrum Disorder","sourcePdf":"tcds-noel-2778141-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.25064S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7274989","isNumber":"8567843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274989","xplore-issue":"8567843","articleId":"8227001","onlineDate":"19 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8227310,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Prandl","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Prandl","id":"37086262827"},{"name":"Mihai Lazarescu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Lazarescu","id":"37331757700"},{"name":"Duc Son Pham","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia"],"firstName":"Duc Son","lastName":"Pham","id":"38183838200"},{"name":"Sie Teng Soh","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia"],"firstName":"Sie Teng","lastName":"Soh","id":"37385936200"},{"name":"Subhash Kak","affiliation":["Oklahoma State University Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA"],"firstName":"Subhash","lastName":"Kak","id":"37326201500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1968-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1969-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227310","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":502},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Probability distribution","Anomaly detection","Servers","Security","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power law probability distributions","network anomaly detection","SYN packet inter arrival times","nonconformity","power laws","Benfords law conformity","Zipfs laws","network traffic anomaly detection","denial-of-service attack detection","DoS attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Benford's Law","Zip's Law","Anomaly Detection"]}],"abstract":"It has been previously determined that SYN packet inter arrival times are conformant with Benford's law, which predicts the frequency of the leading digits in naturally occurring collections of numbers, and suggested that conformity or non-conformity to Benford's law could be used to detect network anomalies. This paper expands upon that suggestion by making three contributions. First, we verify that conformity to Benford's law of inter arrival times is also true for certain types of both TCP and UDP packets. Second, we discover that packet length could also be another alternative to inter arrival times, with the advantage that it follows both Benford's and Zipf's laws, implying its reliability in detecting network traffic anomaly. Finally, we explore the potential application of power laws in the specific detection of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks using both inter arrival times and packet length.

The acquired point clouds are large-scale and precisely record complex 3D internal structures of the scanned objects. Visualization quality of such point clouds highly depends on density distributional uniformity, that is, the uniformity of the inter-point distances. The visualization quality can be improved by making point distances uniform. In addition, the visibility further improves by emphasizing edges. In this study, first the uniformity and flexible tuning of the point density based on Poisson disk sampling are examined. The resultant high-quality point clouds are then applied to transparent visualization. Moreover, edge emphasis visualization is realized by combining the principal component analysis calculating feature amount and Poisson disk sampling.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Culture.and.Computing.2017.19","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture and Computing)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture and Computing)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226657/8227318/08227334.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"19","doi":"10.1109/Culture.and.Computing.2017.19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Transparent Visualization of Large-Scale Laser-Scanned Point Clouds by Using Poisson Disk Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Improving Transparent Visualization of Large-Scale Laser-Scanned Point Clouds by Using Poisson Disk Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227334/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452180","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227334/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Transparent Visualization of Large-Scale Laser-Scanned Point Clouds by Using Poisson Disk Sampling","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1135a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05618S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226657","isNumber":"8227318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226657","xplore-issue":"8227318","articleId":"8227334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8227351,"authors":[{"name":"Song Tong","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatic, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Tong","id":"37085578218"},{"name":"Xuefeng Liang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatic, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086262970"},{"name":"Takatsune Kumada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatic, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takatsune","lastName":"Kumada","id":"37086265127"},{"name":"Sunao Iwaki","affiliation":["Human Technology Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Sunao","lastName":"Iwaki","id":"37086266899"},{"name":"Naoko Tosa","affiliation":["Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoko","lastName":"Tosa","id":"37086262738"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1135-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1136-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227351","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Psychology","Coherence","Neurons","Data visualization","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learned attributes","culture specific theory","complicated facial aesthetics cognition","cultural consistent facial aesthetics","psychology","computer science","computational models","cross-culture coherence theory","handcrafted geometry","appearance features","aesthetics attributes","learning","end-to-end convolutional neural network model","CNN","sallower layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facial Aesthetics","Convolutional Neural Network","Deep Visualization","Geometric Features"]}],"abstract":"Studying facial aesthetics has stimulated great interests in psychology and computer science due to a constant debate on whether it is cross-culture coherent or culture specific. Most computational models follow the cross-culture coherence theory and quantify the facial aesthetics by handcrafted geometry and appearance features, however, which are not directly derived from the raw data. In this work, we develop an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize the facial aesthetics, which is able to learn the aesthetics attributes automatically from data. By visualizing the attributes in the last fully connected layer, we find that they are largely consistent with the cross-culture coherence theory. Furthermore, the learned attributes in the sallower layer illustrate a potential correlation with the culture specific theory. This research demonstrates a case study of the complicated facial aesthetics cognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning the Cultural Consistent Facial Aesthetics by Convolutional Neural Network","doi":"10.1109/Culture.and.Computing.2017.53","startPage":"97","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Culture.and.Computing.2017.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227318","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture and Computing)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture and Computing)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226657/8227318/08227351.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning the Cultural Consistent Facial Aesthetics by Convolutional Neural Network","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227351/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452177","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning the Cultural Consistent Facial Aesthetics by Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1135a097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114032S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226657","isNumber":"8227318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226657","xplore-issue":"8227318","articleId":"8227351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227386,"authors":[{"name":"Huynh The Vu","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, RMIT University Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Huynh The","lastName":"Vu","id":"37086104625"},{"name":"Richardt H.

The data-driven tree structures were obtained using the Chow-Liu Recursive Grouping (CLRG) algorithm, representing the joint distribution of human body joints and tested using the Leeds Sports Pose (LSP) dataset. The paper analyzes the effect of the variation of the number of nodes on the accuracy of the HPE. Experimental results showed that the data-driven tree model obtained 1% higher HPE accuracy compared to the traditional anatomy-based model. A further improvement of 0.5% was obtained by optimizing the number of nodes in the traditional anatomy-based model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pose estimation","Kernel","Torso","Transforms","Message passing","Feature extraction","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pose estimation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven tree models","articulated Human Pose Estimation","structured learning framework","data-driven tree structures","Chow-Liu Recursive Grouping algorithm","Leeds Sports Pose dataset","tree model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227386","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227386.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison between Anatomy-Based and Data-Driven Tree Models for Human Pose Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison between Anatomy-Based and Data-Driven Tree Models for Human Pose Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227386/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227386/","accessionNumber":"17452131","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison between Anatomy-Based and Data-Driven Tree Models for Human Pose Estimation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1203992.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091626S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8227412,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Xue","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086298554"},{"name":"Du Q.

Existing methods focus on analysing the influence of neighbours but ignore the effect of the intended destinations of pedestrians which also plays a key role in route planning. In this paper, we propose a novel two- stage trajectory prediction method to yield multiple prediction trajectories with different probabilities towards different destination regions in the scene. Our method, which we refer to as Bi-Prediction, uses a bidirectional LSTM architecture to automatically classify trajectories into a small number of route classes before trajectory prediction. We have evaluated our method against two baseline methods and three state-of-art methods on two benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that the extra classification stage improves the accuracy of the predicted trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227412","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227412.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-Prediction: Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Bidirectional LSTM Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Predictive models","Computer architecture","Force","Logic gates","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","pedestrians","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two- stage trajectory prediction method","multiple prediction trajectories","Bi-Prediction","bidirectional LSTM architecture","predicted trajectories","pedestrian trajectory prediction","bidirectional LSTM classification","intelligent tracking systems","space planning","route planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Bi-Prediction: Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Bidirectional LSTM Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227412/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452105","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Prediction: Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Bidirectional LSTM Classification","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1203822.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075941S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8227413,"authors":[{"name":"Toufique A.

A computerised algorithm is required for analysing the progress of eye diseases. A variety of computerised retinal segmentation methods have been proposed but almost all methods to date show low sensitivity for narrowly low contrast vessels. We propose a new retinal vessel segmentation algorithm to address the issue of low sensitivity. The proposed method introduces a deep learning model along with pre-processing and post-processing. The pre-processing is used to handle the issue of uneven illuminations. We design a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to get fine vessels observation.The post-processing step is used to remove the background noise pixels to achieve well-segmented vessels. The proposed segmentation method gives good segmented images especially for detecting tiny vessels. We evaluate our method on the commonly used publicly available databases: DRIVE and STARE databases. The higher sensitivity of 75% leads to proper detection of tiny vessels with an accuracy of 94.7%.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227413","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227413.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting Sensitivity of a Retinal Vessel Segmentation Algorithm with Convolutional Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Boosting Sensitivity of a Retinal Vessel Segmentation Algorithm with Convolutional Neural Network","htmlLink":"/document/8227413/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17434250","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting Sensitivity of a Retinal Vessel Segmentation Algorithm with Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1203454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075674S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227414,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Jinling Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086287341"},{"name":"Yong Hu","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Jinling Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086285144"},{"name":"Jinxia Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of CSE, Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinxia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086287330"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2839-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2840-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227414","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Character Recognition via a Compact Convolutional Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Convolution","Image recognition","Machine learning","Benchmark testing","Optical character recognition software","Network architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural scenes","neural nets","optical character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluttered backgrounds","geometry distortion","deep learning method","natural scene images","compact representation","compact convolutional neural network","Optical Character Recognition","OCR","natural scenes","illumination variance"]}],"abstract":"Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the scanned documents has been a well-studied problem in the past. However, when these characters come from the natural scenes, it becomes a much more challenging problem, as there exist many difficulties in these images, e.g., illumination variance, cluttered backgrounds, geometry distortion. In this paper, we propose to use a deep learning method that based on the convolutional neural networks to recognize this kind of characters and word in the scene images. Based on the original VGG-Net, we focus on how to make a compact architecture on this net, and get both the character and word recognition results under the same framework. We conducted several experiments on the benchmark datasets of the natural scene images. The experiments has shown that our method can achieve the state-of-art performance and at the same time has a more compact representation.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227414","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Character Recognition via a Compact Convolutional Neural Network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452116","htmlLink":"/document/8227414/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Character Recognition via a Compact Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1204144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140427S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227420,"authors":[{"name":"Soumava Kumar Roy","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Soumava Kumar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37086273376"},{"name":"Mehrtash Harandi","affiliation":["DATA61, CSIRO, ACT, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Mehrtash","lastName":"Harandi","id":"37283465200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2839-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2840-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227420","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":920},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227420","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Optimization","Geometry","Machine learning","Measurement","Symmetric matrices","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","SGD algorithm","constrained problems","stochastic gradient descent","large scale problems","Riemannian geometry","accelerated optimization techniques"]}],"abstract":"Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is the method of choice for large scale problems, most notably in deep learning.

However, how to effectively implement spatial context that has been demonstrated to be crucial for classification of HSI is still an open issue. Current CNNs for hyperspectral classification are restricted into a small scale due to small-scale input and limited training samples. Therefore, in this paper, two different ways are proposed to implement both spatial context and spectral signature into CNN based classification of HSI: 1). fixed kernels in which weights are determined by prior information, i.e., mean, mean and standard deviation of pixels in a spatial neighborhood, and Gaussian kernel; 2). learnable kernels in which weights are learned from training samples, i.e., 2D learnable kernel, 3D convolutional kernel, and 2-Layer kernel. In the successive CNN for classification of HSI, dropout and batch normalization are also used to improve the classification performance of hyperspectral images under small sample conditions. Experiments on two- known HSIs demonstrating that, in the considered small-scale CNN, fixed kernels are more effective than learnable kernels to explore spatial information for classification of HSIs, especially for the case with small number of training samples.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227429","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227429.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Kernel Based Spatial Context for CNN Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452164","htmlLink":"/document/8227429/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Kernel Based Spatial Context for CNN Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1203842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080621S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227433,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liang","affiliation":["Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085445624"},{"name":"Lihong Zheng","affiliation":["Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37290553600"},{"name":"Jiwan Han","affiliation":["Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jiwan","lastName":"Han","id":"37085682361"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2839-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2840-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227433","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Video sequences","Image enhancement","Lighting","Hidden Markov models","Training","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","feature extraction","image enhancement","image retrieval","image sequences","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video sequence","single face sample","automatic face retrieval","target person","computer vision","image enhancement step","facial region","common face retrieval problem","extended training samples","face related tasks","face validation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227433","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227433.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Retrieval in Video Sequences Using a Single Face Sample","abstract":"Automatic face retrieval or verification is a matter to identify whether the target person is the same person, which has been received considerable attention by researchers in computer vision.

The image enhancement step is followed in order to reduce the illumination variation. Image enhancement considers facial region's local mean and standard deviation. Later Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to generate any number of imitated face images for each face by perturbing its n-ordered images. Consequently, the problem of face retrieval with one sample image becomes a common face retrieval problem. In addition, we use the extended t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) to extract condensed facial features. Correspondingly the computation cost is reduced largely. On the basis of the original one facial sample and extended training samples, our proposed method shows a better performance with comparison to other methods. Therefore, the proposed method is effective and competitive.

Therefore, several automated styling methods have been developed using powerful Deep Neural Network (DNN) features. They typically use a carefully constructed joint loss function to separately consider the similarities between a proposed output and the input content & style images. However, most previous methods apply a single homogeneous stylization optimization to the entire image or require manual creation of segmentation masks for good performance. These systems may perform poorly when the input style and content image differ greatly, or if the content requires a difference in the rendering of certain regions (e.g. facial details). In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous stylization system making full use of a Segmentation Deep Convolution Neural Network, which produces hierarchical semantic information and performs feature extraction simultaneously. This allows a semantically guided heterogeneous stylization.

Robustness to geometric transformations is highly desirable for applications like wild life monitoring where there is no control on the pose of the objects of interest. The images of different objects viewed from various observation points define equivalence classes where by definition two images are said to be equivalent if they are views from the same object. These equivalence classes can be learned via embeddings that map the input images to vectors of real numbers. During training, equivalent images are mapped to vectors that get pulled closer together, whereas if the images are not equivalent their associated vectors get pulled apart. In this work, we present an effective deep neural network model for learning the homographic equivalence between patterns. The long term aim of this research is to develop more robust manta ray recognizers. Manta rays bear unique natural spot patterns on their bellies. Visual identification based on these patterns from underwater images enables a better understanding of habitat use by monitoring individuals within populations. We test our model on a dataset of artificially generated patterns that resemble natural patterning. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture is able to discriminate between patterns subjected to large homographic transformations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227457/","accessionNumber":"17452141","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227457/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning Geometric Equivalence between Patterns Using Embedding Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Geometric Equivalence between Patterns Using Embedding Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1203650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078072S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227460,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah-Al Nahid","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Abdullah-Al","lastName":"Nahid","id":"37086272419"},{"name":"Yinan Kong","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086047152"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2839-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2840-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227460","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local and Global Feature Utilization for Breast Image Classification by Convolutional Neural Network","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8226656/8227375/08227460.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227375","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227460","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cancer","Feature extraction","Histograms","Kernel","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","convolution","feature extraction","image classification","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast image classification","convolutional Neural network","Convolutional Neural Networks","revolutionary improvement","image analysis","image classification field","natural image classification","CNN method","medical image classification","global features extraction","hand-crafted features","CNN network","classification purposes","local feature utilization","global feature utilization","CNN model classifies images"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227460","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have brought a revolutionary improvement to image analysis, especially in the image classification field.

Although considerable efforts have been devoted to solving this problem, exact algorithms are still impractical for real-world data. Randomized hypothesize-and-test approaches such as RANSAC and its variants are therefore still the key players in the field. Revolving around the original RANSAC algorithm, different sampling schemes have been proposed. Despite achieving substantial improvements, these RANSAC variants are still insufficient for highly contaminated data. With the aim to improve the class of randomized techniques, this paper contributes a novel approach to solve the maximum consensus problem using Monte Carlo Tree Search. Based on the theory of the LP-type problems, we reformulate the maximum consensus as an instance of tree search, which advocates the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore the tree. We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms other state- of-the-art methods in common geometric estimation problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227480/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452073","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"RATSAC - Random Tree Sampling for Maximum Consensus Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RATSAC - Random Tree Sampling for Maximum Consensus Estimation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1204114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06456S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8227483,"authors":[{"name":"Lihong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Charles Sturt University Wagga, Wagga, Australia"],"firstName":"Lihong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37290553600"},{"name":"Bin Liang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Charles Sturt University Wagga, Wagga, Australia"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085445624"},{"name":"Ailian Jiang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Technology, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Ailian","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086314123"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2839-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2840-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227483","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1285},"abstract":"To assist the social interaction of deaf and hearing impaired people, efficient interactive communication tools is expected.

The network is trained using the residual image so as to obtain a high resolution image from two, low resolution views. Our network is comprised by two deep sub-nets which share, at their output, a single convolutional layer. This last layer in the network delivers an estimate of the residual image which is then used, in combination with the left input frame of the stereo pair, to compute the super-resolved image at output. Each of these sub- networks is comprised by ten weight layers and, hence, allows our network to combine structural information in the image across image regions efficiently. Moreover, by learning the residual image, the network copes better with vanishing gradients and its devoid of gradient clipping operations. We illustrate the utility of our network for image-pair super-resolution and compare our network to its non-gradient trained analogue and alternatives elsewhere in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2017.8227492","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications

The most commonly applied clinical methods for Bone Age Assessment (BAA) are based on the visual examination of ossification of individual bones in radiographs of the left hand and the wrist by comparing with standard hand atlas. This kind of method is highly subjective and the performance extremely depends on practitioners' experiences. This paper investigates the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for the automatic bone age assessment. As there exists no large-scale annotated medical image dataset comparable to ImageNet for medical image analysis, this paper uses transfer learning within DCNNs to perform bone age classifications making full use of advantages of DCNNs. We define various Regions of Interest (ROIs) based on domain knowledge, for each of which a local bone age classification model is achieved by fine-tuning the pre-trained VGGNet with corresponding ROI patches. A final bone age classification is obtained by fusing multiple regional models. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods in BAA with small dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17452149","htmlLink":"/document/8227503/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-1 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for Bone Age Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning for Bone Age Classification","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"pid1203820.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082242S","chronDate":"Nov. 29 2017-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8226656","isNumber":"8227375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8226656","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8227375","articleId":"8227503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227542,"authors":[{"name":"Michela Mu\u00f1oz Fern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Mission Control Systems Engineering, Software and Architecture, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States"],"firstName":"Michela Mu\u00f1oz","lastName":"Fern\u00e1ndez","id":"37086276977"},{"name":"Yisong Yue","affiliation":["Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States"],"firstName":"Yisong","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085390468"},{"name":"Romann Weber","affiliation":["Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States"],"firstName":"Romann","lastName":"Weber","id":"37086279157"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3462-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3463-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8227542","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tools","Telemetry","Space vehicles","Mars","Anomaly detection","NASA","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aerospace control","learning (artificial intelligence)","Mars","space research","space vehicles","telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["valuable decision support","spacecraft operators","NASA Mars Science Laboratory mission","telemetry anomaly detection system","machine learning","streamline mission operations","spacecraft housekeeping telemetry","flight control centers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"Spacecraft housekeeping telemetry is monitored at flight control centers by the operations engineers using tools that can perform limit checking or simple trend analysis.

Therefore, it is imperative to develop proper rehabilitation techniques to prevent falls and injuries. A vibrotactile device was developed as a training tool to enhance the rehabilitation of persons with recent lower-limb amputations. Stimuli provided by the device trains the user to sense discrete perturbations and then perform a corrective movement to reduce the chance of a fall. This pilot study was conducted to test the functionality of the device in improving the prosthetic proprioception of lower-limb amputees and the effect of the training instruction on motor learning. Two subjects were included in this study, one control and one receiving experimental training, with both subjects performing standing and walking tasks. Standing trials were used to evaluate the improvements in response and movement times and walking trials were tested for improvements in correct movement. In the standing task, the control and the experimental subject showed a 0.1% and 17% improvement in response time, respectively. In the walking task, both subjects showed improvements in making correct movement. Future work will focus on the design improvements of the device and the experiment protocols to further evaluate the effectiveness of the training.","doi":"10.1109/HIC.2017.8227626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIC.2017.8227626","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Healthcare Innovations and Point of Care Technologies (HI-POCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187165/8227561/08227626.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Healthcare Innovations and Point of Care Technologies (HI-POCT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proprioceptive improvements of lower-limb amputees under training with a vibrotactile device \u2014 A pilot study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Proprioceptive improvements of lower-limb amputees under training with a vibrotactile device \u2014 A pilot study","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227626/","accessionNumber":"17419148","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227626/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proprioceptive improvements of lower-limb amputees under training with a vibrotactile device \u2014 A pilot study","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"0980102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049587S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187165","isNumber":"8227561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187165","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227561","articleId":"8227626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8227631,"authors":[{"name":"Meilin Zhu","affiliation":["Center for Personalized Diagnostics, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA"],"firstName":"Meilin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086333411"},{"name":"Uwadiae Obahiagbon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Uwadiae","lastName":"Obahiagbon","id":"37085622635"},{"name":"Karen S.

Most commercial lateral flow tests use colorimetric detection on a nitrocellulose substrate. In this paper, we present a multistep, fluorescence-based assay detection system, which can detect antibodies in plasma to recombinant protein. Fluorescence-based detection allows us to achieve higher sensitivity, while a nitrocellulose substrate enables fluid handling, high protein immobilization, rapid detection time, and affordability. As a proof-of-concept for detection of disease-specific biomarkers in plasma, we demonstrate the detection of antibodies in plasma to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) recombinant protein and to human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E7 recombinant protein. We show that our detection system is able to detect EBNA-1-specific antibodies at a 1:10,000 plasma dilution and HPV 16 E7-specific antibodies at a 1:5,000 plasma dilution, indicating high sensitivity. This platform is a low-cost device that can detect fluorescence from labeled biomarkers on a lateral flow assay. Ultimately, we aim to adapt this system to detect HPV 16 and 18 biomarkers for cervical cancer screening in LMICs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Healthcare Innovations and Point of Care

In underwater environments this communication is not trivial, since it is based on acoustic signals that propagate in a challenging environment characterized by multipath, Doppler effect and long delays. To avoid collisions between the different members of the network, usually a Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme is employed, which cause a high latency in the system. In this work, a communication system based on Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is presented. This system can be used by a team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to exchange information in order to perform cooperative localization with no time scheduling, minimizing the system latency. Experimental tests showed the feasibility of the communication system, retrieving the original data even when the signals overlap at the receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA communication system for cooperative localization of underwater vehicles","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227642","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA communication system for cooperative localization of underwater vehicles","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227642/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451521","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA communication system for cooperative localization of underwater vehicles","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p26apariciososa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041697S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227651,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluigi Liva","affiliation":["Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), We\u03b2ling, Germany"],"firstName":"Gianluigi","lastName":"Liva","id":"37392271200"},{"name":"Giuseppe Durisi","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Durisi","id":"37266490000"},{"name":"Marco Chiani","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Chiani","id":"37268945300"},{"name":"Shakeel Salamat Ullah","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shakeel Salamat","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37085844223"},{"name":"Soung Chang Liew","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Soung Chang","lastName":"Liew","id":"37279300600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227651","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receivers","Decoding","Pragmatics","Error probability","Encoding","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","channel estimation","decoding","error correction codes","error statistics","fading channels","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short codes","mismatched channel state information","short-data packets","AWGN channel","error control coding","channel estimation","short blocks","fading channels","phase-noise channels","mismatched-decoding framework","short data packet","mismatched decoding","transmission strategies","transmission frame","converse bounds","low-density parity-check codes","channel code","channel codes","block error probability"]}],"abstract":"The rising interest in applications requiring the transmission of small amounts of data has recently lead to the development of accurate performance bounds and of powerful channel codes for the transmission of short-data packets over the AWGN channel. Much less is known about the interaction between error control coding and channel estimation at short blocks when transmitting over channels with states (e.g., fading channels, phase-noise channels, etc...) for the setup where no a priori channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, we use the mismatched-decoding framework to characterize the fundamental tradeoff occurring in the transmission of short data packet over an AWGN channel with unknown gain that stays constant over the packet. Our analysis for this simplified setup aims at showing the potential of mismatched decoding as a tool to design and analyze transmission strategies for short blocks. We focus on a pragmatic approach where the transmission frame contains a codeword as well as a preamble that is used to estimate the channel (the codeword symbols are not used for channel estimation). Achievability and converse bounds on the block error probability achievable by this approach are provided and compared with simulation results for schemes employing short low-density parity-check codes. Our bounds turn out to predict accurately the optimal trade-off between the preamble length and the redundancy introduced by the channel code.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227651","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227651.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short codes with mismatched channel state information: A case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Short codes with mismatched channel state information: A case study","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227651/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451506","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227651/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short codes with mismatched channel state information: A case study","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p72liva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096743S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227652,"authors":[{"name":"Veljko Boljanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Power, Electronic and Communications Engineering, University of Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Veljko","lastName":"Boljanovi\u0107","id":"37086300612"},{"name":"Dejan Vukobratovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Power, Electronic and Communications Engineering, University of Novi Sad, Serbia"],"firstName":"Dejan","lastName":"Vukobratovi\u0107","id":"37567276900"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"},{"name":"\u010cedomir Stefanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"\u010cedomir","lastName":"Stefanovi\u0107","id":"37567275100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227652","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Iterative decoding","Matching pursuit algorithms","Silicon carbide","Resource management","Decoding","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cellular radio","compressed sensing","encoding","energy conservation","machine-to-machine communication","multi-access systems","resource allocation","signal detection","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive random access","machine-type communication services","mobile cellular systems","massive-scale user access","compressed-sensing","system resource utilization","compressed sensing","energy-efficiency","coded slotted ALOHA","user activity detection"]}],"abstract":"Machine-type communication services in mobile cellular systems are currently evolving with an aim to efficiently address a massive-scale user access to the system.

Our preliminary results show that CS-based approach is able to provide the target user activity detection performance with less overall system resource utilization.

At the initial stage, the conventional linear detector based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion is employed, followed by the channel decoder. Per-antenna interference cancellation is then applied to the signals that are detected to be correct by the CRC test. Prior to the second channel decoder, a fixed-complexity MIMO detector such as QR-decomposition (QRD)-M-algorithm and the fixed-complexity sphere decoding (FSD) with parallel candidate adding (PCA) is employed. The overall system is shown to improve the MIMO decoder performance significantly, while reducing average computational complexity. The use of perantenna adaptive modulation is also proposed, which can further enhance the throughput of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227656","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227656.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive MIMO-BICM system with CRC-assisted two-stage interference cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive MIMO-BICM system with CRC-assisted two-stage interference cancellation","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227656/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451505","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227656/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive MIMO-BICM system with CRC-assisted two-stage interference cancellation","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p98hagihara.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053873S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227658,"authors":[{"name":"Shinsuke Ibi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinsuke","lastName":"Ibi","id":"37403574200"},{"name":"Seiichi Sampei","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Technology, Osaka University, Suita, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiichi","lastName":"Sampei","id":"38262497100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227658","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"The present paper deals with the under-determined problems caused by channel estimations using insufficient non-orthogonal pilot sequences for large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) iterative detection in large scaled belief propagation. The under-determined channel estimation problem induces under-determined signal detections. The problem seems to lie in the fact that the non-orthogonal pilot sequences shrink Frobenius norm of a pilot matrix for MIMO channels. For obtaining sufficient value of the Frobenius norm, data associated iterative channel estimation for Gaussian belief propagation detector is proposed. For solving the composite under-determined problems, the validity of the proposed iterative manner is demonstrated by computer simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227658.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data associated iterative channel estimations with non-orthogonal pilot for large MIMO detections","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","iterative methods","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal pilot sequences","channel estimation problem","under-determined signal detections","Frobenius norm","pilot matrix","MIMO channels","Gaussian belief propagation detector","under-determined problems","data associated iterative channel estimations","MIMO detections","multiple-input multiple-output iterative detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Data associated iterative channel estimations with non-orthogonal pilot for large MIMO detections","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227658/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451447","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data associated iterative channel estimations with non-orthogonal pilot for large MIMO detections","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p108ibi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075137S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227659,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Iwanow","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Univcrsit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), Germany"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Iwanow","id":"38252787400"},{"name":"Nikola Vu\u010di\u0107","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Vu\u010di\u0107","id":"37541775900"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Univcrsit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"},{"name":"Mario H.

The partially-connected structure employs a small number of phase shifters and therefore serves as an energy efficient solution for hybrid precoding. In this paper, we propose a DOUBLE PHASE SHIFTER (DPS) implementation for the phase shifter network in the partially-connected structure, which allows more tractable and flexible hybrid precoder design. In particular, the hybrid precoder design is identified as an eigenvalue problem. To further enhance the performance, dynamic mapping from radio frequency (RF) chains to antennas is proposed, for which a greedy algorithm and a modified K-means algorithm are developed. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed hybrid precoding algorithms with the DPS implementation over existing ones.

Towards efficient spectrum usage in ultra-dense heterogeneous networks, spectrum reuse between backhauling and access links combined with full duplex is applied. This forms a full-duplex self-backhauled heterogeneous network (FS-HetNet). Considering co-channel interference caused by frequency reuse, and residual self interference due to imperfect interference cancellation in full duplex, interference management becomes a major issue in boosting network performance. In this paper, motivated by the emerging non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for 5G, we consider a NOMA-based scheme to mitigate co-channel interference and achieve efficient spectrum utilization for FS-HetNet. We address an energy-saving problem for the considered network, aiming to satisfy all users' data demand within a limited transmit duration by consuming minimum energy. In addition to the energy consumption in transmission, the consumed decoding energy due to signal processing in successive interference cancellation is also taken into account. We propose an energy-efficient and delay-constrained scheduling algorithm to jointly optimize transmit power, user clustering, and transmission duration. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms previous schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227665.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy optimization for full-duplex self-backhauled HetNet with non-orthogonal multiple access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Decoding","Wireless communication","Optimization","Interchannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","cochannel interference","energy conservation","energy consumption","frequency allocation","interference suppression","multi-access systems","multiplexing","telecommunication power management","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy optimization","multiuser access schemes","5G system performance","ultra-dense heterogeneous networks","spectrum reuse","access links","FS-HetNet","co-channel interference","frequency reuse","residual self interference","NOMA","energy-saving problem","energy consumption","successive interference cancellation","user clustering","spectrum usage","spectrum utilization","full-duplex self-backhauled heterogeneous network","nonorthogonal multiple access","decoding energy","small cell densification","5G system","delay-constrained scheduling algorithm","energy-efficient algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access","wireless backhaul","full duplex","energy minimization","user clustering","heterogeneous network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy optimization for full-duplex self-backhauled HetNet with non-orthogonal multiple access","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227665/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451536","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy optimization for full-duplex self-backhauled HetNet with non-orthogonal multiple access","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p144lei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085844S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227666,"authors":[{"name":"Lanjie Shi","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lanjie","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086294164"},{"name":"Yung-Shun Wang","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Institute of Information Science, Taiwan","Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Shun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086295128"},{"name":"Y.-W.

Beamforming is adopted at the base-station to mitigate both intercell and intracell interference whereas power-domain multiplexing between a pair of users is considered in each spatial dimension. Given the beamforming vectors, intra-pair power allocation is first determined by maximizing the weighted sum rate under worst-case interference. Then, two coordinated beamforming schemes that take into consideration the effect of power-domain multiplexing are proposed, namely, the coordinated scheduling with pair-wise zero-forcing (CSPZF) and the maximum pair-wise signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (PSLNR) beamforming schemes. CSPZF beamforming utilizes the available spatial degrees of freedom at each base-station to separate signals intended for intracell user pairs as well as to eliminate strong out-of-cell interference. PSLNR beamforming, on the other hand, enhances the signal intended for each user pair while suppressing its leakage towards other users (including those in other cells). CSPZF is shown to outperform PSLNR beamforming in the high SNR regime where the performance is interference-limited and, vice versa.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227666","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227666.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated beamforming and power allocation for multicell NOMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated beamforming and power allocation for multicell NOMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451446","htmlLink":"/document/8227666/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated beamforming and power allocation for multicell NOMA systems","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p149shi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.381878S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8227667,"authors":[{"name":"Bofeng Yuan","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Bofeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085741616"},{"name":"Arash Gholami Davoodi","affiliation":["Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing (CPCC), University of California, Irvine"],"firstName":"Arash Gholami","lastName":"Davoodi","id":"37085449915"},{"name":"Syed A.

To reduce cooperation overhead (among different BSs), we prefer partial cooperation transmission such that each user's data stream (either multicast or unicast) is served by only a small subset of BSs.

Massive connectivity is one of the most important requirements for the next generation 5G networks. Since the complicated scheduling process of current 4G systems causes heavy load and large latency in supporting a large number of devices, the grant-free communication becomes viable option in massive machine type communication (mMTC) systems. In this paper, we propose a joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) technique for grant-free mMTC systems. The proposed algorithm consists of AUD, time-domain channel estimation, and identified user cancellation. Specifically, once an active device is identified, the channel for this device is estimated. Using the active user and channel information, the received signal is refined for the next iteration of AUD process. We show that the proposed iterative AUD and CE algorithm achieves substantial performance gain over the conventional AUD in realistic uplink grant-free mMTC environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint active user detection and channel estimation for massive machine-type communications","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227673","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint active user detection and channel estimation for massive machine-type communications","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227673/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451502","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint active user detection and channel estimation for massive machine-type communications","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p184park.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097034S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227681,"authors":[{"name":"Erich Z\u00f6chmann","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Dependable Wireless Connectivity for the Society in Motion","TU Wien, Institute of Telecommunications, Austria"],"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Z\u00f6chmann","id":"37085553325"},{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Guan","id":"37404288100"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["TU Wien, Institute of Telecommunications, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227681","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fresnel reflection","Mathematical model","Wireless communication","Data models","Ray tracing","Receiving antennas","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mmWave communications","two-ray model","wireless channels","millimeter wave bands","break point distance","generalized first Fresnel zone","simplified approximation formula","two-ray ground-reflection model","ray-tracing data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["break point","mmwave","channel modelling","two-ray model","path loss"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227681","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227681","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","abstract":"The two-ray model has been used for modelling of wireless channels already for decades.

The spatially sparse MIMO channel is modeled in terms of the basis array response matrices corresponding to the quantized directional cosines at the transmit and receive antenna arrays followed by the development of an expectation maximization (EM)-based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) channel estimation approach. Subsequently, an enhanced variant of the SBL scheme is proposed based on hard thresholding the associated hyperparameter estimates, which is observed to significantly improve the accuracy of channel estimation. The Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (BCRB) is also derived to benchmark the accuracy of the proposed SBL-based channel estimation schemes.

Existing works consider caching only at higher layers separated from physical layer. In this paper, we study wireless caching networks by taking into account cache capability when designing the signal transmission. In particular, we investigate multi-layer caching and their performance in edge-caching wireless networks where both base station (BS) and users are capable of storing content data in their local cache. Two notable uncoded and coded caching strategies are studied. Firstly, we propose a coded caching strategy that is applied to arbitrary value of cache size. The required backhaul and access rates are given as a function of the BS and user cache size. Secondly, closed-form expressions for the system energy efficiency (EE) corresponding to the two caching methods are derived. Thirdly, the system EE is maximized via precoding vectors design and optimization while satisfying the user request rate. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the two caching methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient design for edge-caching wireless networks: When is coded-caching beneficial?","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227689","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227689.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient design for edge-caching wireless networks: When is coded-caching beneficial?","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227689/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451458","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient design for edge-caching wireless networks: When is coded-caching beneficial?","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p265vu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048425S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227692,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085626518"},{"name":"Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Derrick Wing Kwan","lastName":"Ng"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227692","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Silicon","Optimization","Wireless communication","Covariance matrices","High definition video","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convex programming","frequency division multiple access","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access radio system","OFDMA","full-duplex base station","half-duplex downlink","uplink transmission","suboptimal iterative algorithm","resource allocation","nonconvex optimization","computational complexity","successive convex approximation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the resource allocation for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) radio system employing a full-duplex base station for serving multiple half-duplex downlink and uplink users simultaneously.

The algorithm design leads to a mixed combinatorial non-convex optimization problem and obtaining the globally optimal solution entails a prohibitively high computational complexity. Therefore, an efficient successive convex approximation based suboptimal iterative algorithm is proposed. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed suboptimal algorithm achieves a significant performance gain compared to two baseline schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for secure full-duplex OFDMA radio systems : (Invited paper)","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227692","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227692.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for secure full-duplex OFDMA radio systems : (Invited paper)","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227692/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451559","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for secure full-duplex OFDMA radio systems : (Invited paper)","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p280sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072494S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227693,"authors":[{"name":"Qingpeng Liang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qingpeng","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085388658"},{"name":"Shengpei Jiang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shengpei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086332234"},{"name":"Chuan Huang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407376100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227693","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio transmitters","Decoding","Receivers","Conferences","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","decoding","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication scheme","full-duplex amplify-and-forward transmitter cooperations","AF transmitter","AF relaying scheme","residual self-interference","additive noise","forward decoding","backward decoding","common receiver","FD transmitters","transmitter cooperations","multiple access channel","decoding schemes","transmission blocks","asymptotic channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227693","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227693.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple access channel with full-duplex amplify-and-forward transmitter cooperations","abstract":"In this paper, a full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) transmitter cooperative communication scheme is proposed for multiple access channel (MAC).

Motivated by this, we revisit a full-duplex base station (FD-BS) aided OFDMA system, which consists of one BS, several uplink/downlink users and multiple subcarriers. A joint 3-dimensional (3D) mapping scheme among subcarriers, down-link users (DUEs), uplink users (UUEs) is considered as well as an associated power allocation optimization. In detail, we first decompose the complex 3D mapping problem into three 2-dimensional sub ones and solve them by using the iterative Hungarian method, respectively. Then based on the Lagrange dual method, we sequentially solve the power allocation and 3-dimensional mapping problem by fixing a dual point. Finally, the optimal solution can be obtained by utilizing the sub-gradient method. Unlike existing work that only solves either 3D mapping or power allocation problem but with a high computation complexity, we tackle both of them and have successfully reduced computation complexity from exponential to polynomial order. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227696.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for a full-duplex base station aided OFDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Three-dimensional displays","Throughput","Conferences","Signal processing","Wireless communication","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","gradient methods","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","full-duplex base station","OFDMA system","full-duplex technology","base stations","FD-BS","uplink/downlink users","multiple subcarriers","3-dimensional mapping scheme","down-link users","uplink users","complex 3D mapping problem","Lagrange dual method","3-dimensional mapping problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex base station","resource allocation","3-dimensional binary assignment","Lagrange dual method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for a full-duplex base station aided OFDMA system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227696/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451539","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for a full-duplex base station aided OFDMA system","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p300you.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065728S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227702,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Lonnstrom","affiliation":["Communications Theory, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Lonnstrom","id":"37086270855"},{"name":"Eduard Jorswieck","affiliation":["Communications Theory, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Jorswieck","id":"37275005700"},{"name":"Daniel Haufe","affiliation":["Laboratory of Measurement and Sensor System Technique, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Haufe","id":"37086097672"},{"name":"Juergen W.

Also, the light waves cannot penetrate walls which enables interference avoidance between compartments. Meanwhile, LiFi access points (APs) have a much shorter range, relative to WiFi APs. A hybrid network can combine the high-speed transmission of LiFi and the ubiquitous coverage of WiFi. For such a network, access point assignment (APA) becomes challenging because of the completely overlaying coverage of different networks. In addition, LiFi is susceptible to channel blockage due to opaque obstacles, adding difficulties to the APA issue. In this paper, a novel APA method is proposed for hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks in consideration of LiFi channel blockage for the first time. By exploiting users' statistical information of channel blockage, the proposed method formulates the issue as an optimisation problem that maximises the system throughput over a period of time. Results show that the proposed method can improve throughput by up to 90% over the conventional load balancing method.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227704","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227704.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access point assignment in hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks in consideration of LiFi channel blockage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Access point assignment in hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks in consideration of LiFi channel blockage","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227704/","accessionNumber":"17451556","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access point assignment in hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks in consideration of LiFi channel blockage","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p340wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048515S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8227714,"authors":[{"name":"Rania Morsi","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Rania","lastName":"Morsi","id":"38232450800"},{"name":"Elena Boshkovska","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Boshkovska","id":"37085633066"},{"name":"Esmat Ramadan","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Esmat","lastName":"Ramadan","id":"37086301800"},{"name":"Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Derrick Wing Kwan","lastName":"Ng","id":"37536288000"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227714","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance of a time-slotted multi-antenna wireless powered communication (WPC) system, where a wireless device first harvests radio frequency (RF) energy from a power station (PS) in the downlink to facilitate information transfer to an information receiving station (IRS) in the uplink. The main goal of this paper is to provide insights and guidelines for the design of practical WPC systems. To this end, we adopt a recently proposed parametric non-linear RF energy harvesting (EH) model, which has been shown to accurately model the end-to-end non-linearity of practical RF EH circuits. In order to enhance the RF power transfer efficiency, maximum ratio transmission is adopted at the PS to focus the energy signals on the wireless device. Furthermore, at the IRS, maximum ratio combining is used. We analyze the outage probability and the average throughput of information transfer, assuming Nakagami-m fading uplink and downlink channels. Moreover, we study the system performance as a function of the number of PS transmit antennas, the number of IRS receive antennas, the transmit power of the PS, the fading severity, the transmission rate of the wireless device, and the EH time duration. In addition, we obtain a fixed point equation for the optimal transmission rate and the optimal EH time duration that maximize the asymptotic throughput for high PS transmit powers.

backscatter is a promising solution for future Internet of Things (IoT) composed of massive low-power wireless devices without external power sources. It is challenging to accommodate these devices with high throughput and long range because of the low efficiency inherent in ambient backscatter. To tackle the challenging issue, we propose an optimum modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for ambient backscatter communication networks (ABCN). We model and analyze the ABCN embedded by semi-passive tags with M-ary modulation and full-duplex WiFi access points as reader. The coverage and network capacity are derived, by which the effect of various system parameters including reflection coefficient, code rate, and cluster size is investigated. It is shown that the optimum MCS for the ABCN will provide highly increased throughput and range for future IoT networks and smart home/office.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17501853","htmlLink":"/document/8227716/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimum MCS for high-throughput long-range ambient backscatter communication networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum MCS for high-throughput long-range ambient backscatter communication networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p400kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064778S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8227719,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad R.

Next, by adopting a multisine waveform structure for the transmit signal of the energy transmitter, we jointly design the multisine signal amplitudes and phases over all frequency tones according to the channel state information (CSI) to maximize the deliverable DC voltage or harvested power. Although our formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we propose two suboptimal solutions to it, based on the frequency-domain maximal ratio transmission (MRT) principle and the sequential convex optimization (SCP) technique, respectively. Using various simulations, the performance gain of our solutions over the existing waveform designs is shown.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectennas","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Integrated circuit modeling","Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","energy harvesting","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform optimization","radio-frequency wireless power transfer","single-input single-output radio-frequency","power transfer system","frequency-selective channels","current-voltage model","energy receiver","semiclosed-form expression","multisine waveform structure","energy transmitter","multisine signal amplitudes","frequency tones","channel state information","frequency-domain maximal ratio transmission principle","sequential convex optimization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Waveform optimization","multisine signal","wireless power transfer","nonlinear energy receiver"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227719","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227719.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform optimization for radio-frequency wireless power transfer : (Invited paper)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Waveform optimization for radio-frequency wireless power transfer : (Invited paper)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227719/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227719/","accessionNumber":"17451483","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform optimization for radio-frequency wireless power transfer : (Invited paper)","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p415vedadymoghadam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081638S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8227720,"authors":[{"name":"Chaosong Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chaosong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086262053"},{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086264351"},{"name":"Wenjin Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292856200"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085362707"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227720","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","MIMO communication","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macro base station","full-dimension multiple-input multiple-output system","macrocellular radio","spectrum sharing","spectrum sharing","single macro base station","large-scale antenna array","interference coordination strategy","statistical channel state information","FD-MIMO HetNet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D beamforming","massive MIMO","statistical CSI","HetNet","interference coordination"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an interference coordination strategy for full-dimension (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) heterogeneous networks (HetNet).

Via a general scaling model on the number of users, the CSI quality and the data transmission power, with respect to the number of base station (BS) antennas, the asymptotic performance scaling law is obtained, which reveals quantitatively the tradeoff of the above three parameters.

The effect of these impairments becomes more severe in the systems involving a large number of inexpensive Radio Frequency (RF) chains such as massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems due to the requirement of cost-efficient implementation. However, most of the existing studies consider ideal transceivers without incorporating the effect of residual hardware impairments. In this regard, this paper studies the impact of additive residual transceiver hardware impairments on the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) filtering performance of Rayleigh-Product (RP) MIMO channels. Using principles from Random Matrix Theory (RMT), the MMSE filtering performance of the RP channels is analyzed and a tight lower bound is derived by taking the effects of residual additive transceiver impairments into account. Moreover, some useful insights on the performance of the considered system with respect to various parameters such as the transmit Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), the number of scatterers and the severity of impairments on both the transmit and receive sides are provided.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227726","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of residual transceiver impairments on MMSE filtering performance of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of residual transceiver impairments on MMSE filtering performance of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227726/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451451","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227726/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of residual transceiver impairments on MMSE filtering performance of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p452sharma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060772S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227727,"authors":[{"name":"Shahar Stein Ioushua","firstName":"Shahar Stein","lastName":"Ioushua"},{"name":"Yonina C.

This causes inter-cell interference called pilot contamination. An additional challenge is the increase in computational load due to the massive amount of data. It is, therefore, desirable to reduce the number of RF chains. In this paper, we focus on the problem of channel estimation in a multi-cell multi-user MIMO system, while addressing these two challenges. We consider a Bayesian channel estimator and design the pilot sequences to minimize the estimation error. In order to reduce the number of RF chains, we propose an analog combiner mapping the high number of sensors to the low number of RF chains. The optimal pilot sequences are shown to correspond to a user selection solution, where the users with the strongest links are chosen. In addition we show that the number of RF chains can be reduced with no significant loss in estimation performance in cases where the receive array is highly correlated.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227727","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227727.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot contamination mitigation with reduced RF chains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot contamination mitigation with reduced RF chains","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227727/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17501850","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227727/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot contamination mitigation with reduced RF chains","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p457steinioushua.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100206S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8227728,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085387352"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["University of Macau, Taipa, Macau, MO"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Jianzhong Zhang","affiliation":["Standards and Mobility Lab., Samsung Research America, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jianzhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085523899"},{"name":"Lingjia Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Lingjia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293117400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227728","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","full-dimensional massive MIMO system","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","three-dimensional antenna array","low-complexity DOA acquisition scheme","direction-of-arrival statistics"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to estimate thousands of channel parameters in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a three-dimensional antenna array, using only one training symbol while assuming no knowledge of path number, noise power, path gain and direction-of-arrival (DOA) statistics.

In this paper, the channel correlation between uplink and downlink channels are analyzed with real channel matrices measured with massive MIMO TDD prototype in outdoor scenarios. Downlink MIMO capacity based on the measured channels are investigated where MIMO precoding is based on the measured uplink channel and MIMO receiver is based on the downlink channel at sub-6GHz frequency band. Results show that channel correlation becomes weak as channel changes from LOS, foliage, to full-blocked NLOS cases. Far-field blockage has slightly impacts on channel reciprocity whereas near-field blockage degrades the channel reciprocity significantly. The achievable rate of downlink MIMO based on the channel reciprocity is crucially dependent on the receiver scheme. The U matrix receiver is sensitive to the imperfect channel reciprocity whereas MMSE receiver can robustly achieve the rate close to perfect channel reciprocity in single user case.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","mobile communication","precoding","radio receivers","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outdoor MIMO measurements","channel correlation","downlink channels","channel matrices","massive MIMO TDD prototype","downlink MIMO capacity","measured uplink channel","MIMO receiver","imperfect channel reciprocity","mobile communications","MIMO precoding","far-field blockage","MMSE receiver","U matrix receiver","frequency 6.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel reciprocity","massive MIMO","channel capacity","MMSE detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227729","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227729.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel reciprocity and capacity analysis with outdoor MIMO measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel reciprocity and capacity analysis with outdoor MIMO measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227729/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227729/","accessionNumber":"17451437","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel reciprocity and capacity analysis with outdoor MIMO measurements","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p467wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051871S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8227730,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhu Chandhar","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Eng.

In this paper, we consider MBM for the uplink of a massive MIMO system, which has not been reported before. Each user is equipped with one transmit antenna with multiple radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) placed near it. The base station (BS) is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive antennas. We investigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) in a massive MIMO setting. Our results show that multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) can significantly outperform other modulation schemes. For example, a bit error performance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the BS in a massive MIMO system using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas using MU-MBM. Even multiuser spatial modulation and generalized spatial modulation in the same massive MIMO settings require more than 200 antennas to achieve the same bit error performance. Also, recognizing that the MU-MBM signal vectors are inherently sparse, we propose an efficient MU-MBM signal detection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), and subspace pursuit (SP).","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227731","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser media-based modulation for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser media-based modulation for massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227731/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451476","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227731/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser media-based modulation for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p478shamasundar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051614S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227732,"authors":[{"name":"Gangtao Han","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhenyang, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Gangtao","lastName":"Han","id":"37085832547"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Zheng Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37076184500"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227732","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factorable space-time modulation","two-user uplink massive MIMO systems","space-time modulation scheme","quadrature amplitude modulation division","two-user massive multiple-input multiple-output uplink system","channel state information","transmitter","transmission scheme","scale channel coefficients","noise-free case","receiver antennas","noisy channel","different detectors","simple closed-form detector","minimum Euclidean distance detector","minimum Riemannian distance detector","BS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","space-time modulation","modulation division"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new space-time modulation scheme using quadrature amplitude modulation division for a two-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink system, in which channel state information (CSI) is unavailable at both the transmitter and the receiver.

In addition to obvious benefits in solely communications type of services, the aforementioned technological advances allow for completely new kind of applications. In this paper, we focus on user equipment (UE) positioning, and additionally show how also successful network synchronization can be done in 5G networks in a highly sophisticated, but low-complex network-centric solution. We will extend the analysis available in the existing literature to fully unsynchronized networks where the UEs as well as the network remote radio heads (RRHs) have clock offsets and skews with respect to a given reference clock.

The optimal transmission power to achieve maximal average capacity is computed as a function of the transmitter-receiver distance r when the transmitter is bounded by an average power constraint.

However, due to high susceptibility to blocking, mmWave links can be extremely intermittent in quality. This combination of high peak throughputs and intermittency can cause significant challenges in end-to-end transport-layer mechanisms such as TCP. This paper studies the particularly challenging problem of bufferbloat. Specifically, with current buffering and congestion control mechanisms, high throughput - high variable links can lead to excessive buffers incurring long latency. In this paper, we capture the performance trends obtained while adopting two potential solutions that have been proposed in the literature: Active queue management (AQM) and dynamic receive window. We show that, over mmWave links, AQM mitigates the latency but cannot deliver high throughput. The main reason relies on the fact that the current congestion control was not designed to cope with high data rates with sudden change. Conversely, the dynamic receive window approach is more responsive and therefore supports higher channel utilization while mitigating the delay, thus representing a viable solution.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227746","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227746.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TCP dynamics over mmwave links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"TCP dynamics over mmwave links","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451510","htmlLink":"/document/8227746/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCP dynamics over mmwave links","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p556zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060353S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":8227747,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin Jonathan Myers","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Nitin Jonathan","lastName":"Myers","id":"37086159549"},{"name":"Robert W.

Prior work has exploited the observation that mmWave MIMO channels are sparse in the spatial angle domain and has used compressed sensing based algorithms for channel estimation. Most of them, however, ignore hardware impairments like carrier frequency offset and phase noise, and fail to perform well when such impairments are considered. In this paper, we develop a compressive channel estimation algorithm for narrowband mmWave systems, which is robust to such non idealities. We address this problem by constructing a tensor that models both the mmWave channel and CFO, and estimate the tensor while still exploiting the sparsity of the mmWave channel. Simulation results show that under the same settings, our method performs better than comparable algorithms that are robust to phase errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International

multiplexing-index modulation (OFDM-IM)-aided cooperative relaying protocol is proposed for overlay cognitive radio (CR) networks, where the primary and secondary networks work concurrently over the same spectrum band. In the proposed scheme, OFDM-IM technique is used at the secondary user (SU) to split the transmission space into the signal constellation domain and the index domain. Specifically, the secondary transmitter (ST) of SU acts as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay to transmit the information of the primary user (PU) in the signal constellation domain, while the information bits of SU are carried by the index domain. Through this design concept, the mutual interference between the PU and SU can be partly avoided. Upper bounds on the bit error probability (BEP) of the PU and SU are analytically derived. We also analyse the achievable rates of this protocol with various finite-size constellations. Several numerical results and discussions are provided to substantiate the theoretical analysis, and to show that the proposed protocol is a viable candidate for OFDM-based overlay CR networks since it can enhance the performances of both PU and SU.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227748","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227748.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM-IM-aided cooperative relaying protocol for cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227748/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM-IM-aided cooperative relaying protocol for cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451464","htmlLink":"/document/8227748/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM-IM-aided cooperative relaying protocol for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p567ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070969S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227749,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Ren Tsai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuh-Ren","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37290160100"},{"name":"Guo-Xin Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guo-Xin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086300082"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Correlation","Time-domain analysis","Sensors","Indexes","Frequency-domain analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","signal detection","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM signals","guard subcarriers","cognitive radio","wireless communications","spectral efficiency","opportunistic spectrum access","efficient spectrum sensing technique","CR networks","computational complexity","time-domain based approaches","spectrum sensing techniques","primary system parameters","time-domain autocorrelation properties","time-varying system parameters","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","cognitive radio (CR)","spectrum sensing","time-domain autocorrelation","guard subcarriers"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) was proposed in wireless communications to improve spectral efficiency based on the concept of opportunistic spectrum access. Because orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become the major access technique, an efficient spectrum sensing technique targeted at OFDM-based signals is one of the primary requirements of CR networks. To reduce computational complexity, time-domain based approaches are highly desirable; in addition, to improve feasibility, spectrum sensing techniques should rely on as few primary system parameters as possible. In this work, we investigate the time-domain autocorrelation properties of OFDM-based signals that are induced by the presence of guard subcarriers. Accordingly, we design an efficient spectrum sensing algorithm for detecting the presence of OFDM signals.

We characterize the optimal scanning policy in the case of at most one free band and show that the policy is computationally challenging. Motivated by this challenge for the implementation of the optimal policy and the need to cope with an unknown number of interferers larger than one, we propose the constrained DGF algorithm.

While ZF precoding can be implemented by exact matrix inversion, this scheme is often prohibited due to stability and complexity issues. Hence a few matrix inverse approximation (MIA) methods were introduced to address these concerns. An eigen-based algorithm was recently proposed to enhance MIA accuracy for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel by estimating asymptotic eigenvalues of a Wishart matrix following the random matrix theory. In this paper, the eigen-based MIA concept is extended to the one-sided Kronecker model, (i.e., Rayleigh fading channel with transmit antenna correlation). Asymptotic eigenvalue probability density function of the non-commutative Kronecker channel is constructed from free probability theory and applied in eigen-based MIA. Simulation shows that MIA is degraded by transmit antenna correlation. However, compared to other Neumann expansion based methods, the proposed eigen-based MIA precoding scheme is still less susceptible to transmit antenna correlation especially for low to mid correlation values.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved matrix inversion approximation method for massive MIMO systems with transmit antenna correlation","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227755","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227755.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"An improved matrix inversion approximation method for massive MIMO systems with transmit antenna correlation","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227755/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451456","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved matrix inversion approximation method for massive MIMO systems with transmit antenna correlation","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p602lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05385S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227756,"authors":[{"name":"Deli Qiao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Deli","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085637529"},{"name":"Haifeng Qian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Qian","id":"37086302094"},{"name":"Geoffrey Ye Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Geoffrey Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37086007303"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227756","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","precoding","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution codebook design","FDD massive MIMO networks","codebook design method","two-stage precoding scheme","frequency division duplex mode","codeword","radiated power","expected average power","coverage beam range","beam-to-leakage ratio","optimization problem","narrow-beam design","novel codebook design based transmission scheme","covariance based method","frequency division duplex"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a new codebook design method for multi-resolution codebook based two-stage precoding scheme in massive MIMO networks in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode.

An optimization problem for narrow-beam design is formulated to maximize the BLR. The codebook is generated via solving the optimization problem.

In mmWave system, hybrid precoding is applied to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Although narrow band multiuser hybrid precoding is widely studied, only a few works focus on wideband hybrid precoding. The main problem is that all subcarrier share the same analog precoding matrix but the channel information in frequency domain are different. In this paper, we propose a wideband hybrid precoding method based on channel angular information in multiuser-MIMO (MU-MIMO) scenario. Since the channel state information (CSI) in time domain are the same for all subcarriers, we first construct a autocorrelation channel matrix by angular information, which is available for all subcarriers. Then, we propose an iterative method using manifold optimization for analog precoders and combiners to achieve higher sum data rate. Simulation results show that our proposed method is superior to the existing hybrid precoding method and has a close performance to digital ZF precoding.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227759.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband hybrid precoder design in MU-MIMO based on channel angular information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Correlation","Radio frequency","Frequency-domain analysis","Manifolds","Receivers","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid precoding method","analog precoding matrix","frequency domain","channel information","narrow band multiuser hybrid precoding","radio frequency chains","mmWave system","fifth generation mobile communication system","hybrid precoder design","digital ZF precoding","combiners","analog precoders","autocorrelation channel matrix","channel state information","MU-MIMO","multiuser-MIMO scenario","channel angular information","wideband hybrid precoding method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid precoding","wideband","autocorrelation channel matrix","angular information","manifold optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Wideband hybrid precoder design in MU-MIMO based on channel angular information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227759/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451498","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband hybrid precoder design in MU-MIMO based on channel angular information","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p622peng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143798S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227760,"authors":[{"name":"Hei Victor Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hei Victor","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38240086500"},{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rnson","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Erik G.

In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning technique for modeling the molecular MIMO channel and confirm the effectiveness via extensive numerical studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227765/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17451480","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Machine learning based channel modeling for molecular MIMO communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine learning based channel modeling for molecular MIMO communications","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p653lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112242S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8227766,"authors":[{"name":"Haoran Sun","affiliation":["Dept. of IMSE, Iowa State University, Ames, IA"],"firstName":"Haoran","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086027514"},{"name":"Xiangyi Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of IMSE, Iowa State University, Ames, IA"],"firstName":"Xiangyi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086279264"},{"name":"Qingjiang Shi","affiliation":["School of Info.

However, these algorithms often require a considerable number of iterations for convergence, which poses challenges for real-time processing. In this work, we propose a new learning-based approach for wireless resource management. The key idea is to treat the input and output of a resource allocation algorithm as an unknown non-linear mapping and to use a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate it. If the nonlinear mapping can be learned accurately and effectively by a DNN of moderate size, then such DNN can be used for resource allocation in almost real time, since passing the input through a DNN to get the output only requires a small number of simple operations. In this work, we first characterize a class of `learnable algorithms' and then design DNNs to approximate some algorithms of interest in wireless communications. We use extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the superior ability of DNNs for approximating two considerably complex algorithms that are designed for power allocation in wireless transmit signal design, while giving orders of magnitude speedup in computational time.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227766","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227766.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to optimize: Training deep neural networks for wireless resource management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227766/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Learning to optimize: Training deep neural networks for wireless resource management","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17451560","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227766/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to optimize: Training deep neural networks for wireless resource management","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p658sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083384S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8227768,"authors":[{"name":"Huikang Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Syst.

The GPM is essentially a projected gradient method and exploits the fact that the projection onto the discrete MPSK or QAM constellation is efficiently computable. As our main contribution, we first show that under certain conditions on the channel and additive noise, the GPM will converge to the true symbol vector in a finite number of iterations. We then show that the aforementioned conditions will be satisfied with high probability under standard probabilistic models of the channel and noise. Besides enjoying strong theoretical guarantees, the proposed method is shown in our simulations to be competitive with existing methods in terms of both detection performance and numerical efficiency. We believe that our techniques will find further applications in the development of high-performance detection methods for massive MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227768","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227768.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete first-order method for large-scale MIMO detection with provable guarantees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227768/","displayDocTitle":"A discrete first-order method for large-scale MIMO detection with provable guarantees","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451438","htmlLink":"/document/8227768/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrete first-order method for large-scale MIMO detection with provable guarantees","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p669liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065828S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227770,"authors":[{"name":"Junyeong Seo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junyeong","lastName":"Seo","id":"38569226500"},{"name":"Youngchul Sung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngchul","lastName":"Sung","id":"37286810600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227770","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Silicon carbide","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","MISO","Transceivers","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","encoding","MIMO communication","MISO communication","multiuser channels","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transceiver architecture","superposition coding","two-user group","ZF beamforming","roughly-orthogonal groups","nontrivial gain","closely-aligned channel vectors","multiuser MIMO communication","single-output broadcast channels","K-user multiple-input single-output broadcast channels","MISO broadcast channels","nonlinear mixture reception","linear mixture reception","linear zero-forcing downlink beamforming","nonlinear successive cancellation reception","Pareto-optimal design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-user MIMO","Transceiver","Pareto-optimality","SIC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new transceiver architecture for K-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channels (BCs) based on linear and non-linear mixture reception is proposed as an alternative to conventional fully linear zero-forcing (ZF) downlink beamforming.

The proposed scheme is motivated by the fact that most conventional receivers produce a sparse residual error vector, which is the difference between the actual transmitted symbol vector and the estimated one. The sparse feature of the residual error vector is utilized to locate the support set of the erroneously detected symbols by using the compressive sensing (CS) framework. We can then remove the effects of the correctly detected symbols and only update the soft information of the symbols with detection errors. Since the number of error symbols is usually much less than that of receive antennas, the sparsity-aided receiver equivalently convert the system into an over-determined MIMO system, and the soft information update of the error symbols can be performed with simple linear receivers. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sparsity-aided iterative receiver can achieve significant performance gains over conventional UD-MIMO receivers, at the cost of a small complexity overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-aided iterative receiver for large scale under-determined MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227771","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227771.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-aided iterative receiver for large scale under-determined MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227771/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451439","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-aided iterative receiver for large scale under-determined MIMO systems","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p684zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057937S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227772,"authors":[{"name":"Neev Samuel","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, The Edmond J.

Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm performs closely similar to the optimal performance at reduced computational costs in GFDM signal detection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manganese","Signal processing algorithms","Wireless communication","Approximation algorithms","Complexity theory","Conferences","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","conjugate gradient methods","matrix algebra","matrix inversion","message passing","OFDM modulation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient method","approximate diagonalization","equivalent channel matrix","OAMP","GFDM signal detection","orthogonal approximate message passing","GFDM data detection","generalized frequency division multiplexing","fifth generation wireless communication systems","matrix inverse operations"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227773","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227773.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal approximate message passing for GFDM detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal approximate message passing for GFDM detection","accessionNumber":"17451553","publicationDate":"July 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227773/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal approximate message passing for GFDM detection","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p695zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060577S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8227776,"authors":[{"name":"Thien Van Luong","affiliation":["Communications and Information Technology, Queens University of Belfast Belfast, NI, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Thien","lastName":"Van Luong","id":"37086231284"},{"name":"Youngwook Ko","affiliation":["Communications and Information Technology, Queens University of Belfast Belfast, NI, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Youngwook","lastName":"Ko","id":"37085432621"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227776","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","OFDM","Frequency diversity","Error probability","Wireless communication","Modulation","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","OFDM modulation","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency diversity","M-ary data symbol","SEP error performance","conventional OFDM","closed-form symbol error probability","Multicarrier Index Keying - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing","repeated MCIK-OFDM","spectral efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MICK-OFDM","index modulation (IM)","symbol error probability (SEP)","frequency diversity","maximum likelihood (ML) detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel scheme of Multi-carrier Index Keying - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MCIK-OFDM), called as repeated MCIK-OFDM (ReMO), which is capable of improving the error performance compared to classical MCIK-OFDM for a given spectral efficiency. Similar to the classical MCIK-OFDM, ReMO activates only a subset of sub-carriers to carry information bits by the use of both the active sub-carriers and their indices. However, unlike the classical scheme, ReMO exploits the frequency diversity such that the same M-ary data symbol is repeatedly used to modulate all the active sub-carriers. To gain an insight into the ReMO performance, a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) is derived. This expression can help us analyze the impact of the ReMO parameters on the symbol error performance and suggest the best ReMO setup to minimize the error probability. Through both theoretical and simulation results, ReMO is successfully proved to provide significantly better diversity order as well as SEP error performance over the conventional OFDM and MCIK-OFDM at the same spectral efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A closed-form symbol error probability for MCIK-OFDM with frequency diversity","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227776","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227776.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"A closed-form symbol error probability for MCIK-OFDM with frequency diversity","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227776/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451509","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A closed-form symbol error probability for MCIK-OFDM with frequency diversity","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p711luong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058696S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227777,"authors":[{"name":"Nesrine Cherif","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, 800, De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Ouest, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Nesrine","lastName":"Cherif","id":"37086059142"},{"name":"Im\u00e8ne Trigui","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, 800, De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Ouest, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Im\u00e8ne","lastName":"Trigui","id":"37391799000"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e8ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, 800, De la Gaucheti\u00e8re Ouest, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00e8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227777","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Apertures","Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Fading channels","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cochannel interference","free-space optical communication","multi-access systems","Nakagami channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-channel interference","transmit aperture selection","mixed multiaperture FSO/multiuser RF relay systems","M\u00e1laga M-distribution","free-space optical/radio frequency communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","co-channel interference","ergodic capacity","free-space optics (FSO)","M\u00e1laga M-distribution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider multi-aperture multiuser dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) free-space optical/radio frequency (FSO/RF) communication systems where the FSO and RF links, respectively, experience M\u00e1laga M-distribution and Nakagami-m fading.

The advantage of localization using UAVs is their movability, that is, even when only few UAVs are available, if each of them ranges a target node many times from different locations, the localization accuracy can be improved, because it virtually increases the number of UAVs, namely, anchor nodes. Unlike conventional localization systems, UAVs are movable, so they can be made a formation, such as a linear formation or a circular formation, to achieve higher localization accuracy for an individual target node to be localized. However, unfortunately, how to make the optimal formation of UAVs has been neither discussed nor solved. In this paper, we consider the formation problem of UAVs for localization. Assuming a two-dimensional time of arrival (TOA)-based localization, we theoretically derive the optimal formation of UAVs which can minimize the localization error.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227783","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal formation of unmanned aerial vehicles for minimizing localization error \u2014 A two-dimensional case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal formation of unmanned aerial vehicles for minimizing localization error \u2014 A two-dimensional case","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227783/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451473","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227783/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal formation of unmanned aerial vehicles for minimizing localization error \u2014 A two-dimensional case","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p746danjo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094982S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8227788,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38195111700"},{"name":"Yonggang Wen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yonggang","lastName":"Wen","id":"37276319700"},{"name":"Ying Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Ying Jun","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Fang Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086314034"},{"name":"Rui Fan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086311300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227788","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Cloud computing","Data compression","Mobile handsets","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data compression","mobile computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile computation cost","input/output data","mobile application","mobile resource","mobile tasks","data compression","voltage scaling","mobile cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Mobile cloud computing provides a cloud-based platform for executing mobile tasks remotely in the cloud.

This work studies the optimization of hybrid beamforming in the context of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture. In a C-RAN system, digital baseband signal processing functionalities are migrated from remote radio heads (RRHs) to a baseband processing unit (BBU) in the \u201ccloud\u201d by means of finite-capacity fronthaul links. Specifically, this work tackles the problem of jointly optimizing digital beamforming and fronthaul quantization strategies at the BBU, as well as RF beamforming at the RRHs, with the goal of maximizing the weighted downlink sum-rate. Fronthaul capacity and per-RRH power constraints are enforced along with constant modulus constraints on the RF beamforming matrices. An iterative algorithm is proposed that is based on successive convex approximation and on the relaxation of the constant modulus constraint.

In each femtocell, the femto base station (FBS) serves one femto user (FU), which is capable of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) energy harvesting (EH) in a power splitting manner. All FBSs suppress their interference to macro users (MUs) via a interference power constraint. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency of all femtocells via the joint design of beamforming and power splitting factors under the quality of service (QoS) and EH constraints in FUs and interference constraints in MUs. The non-convex objective function and constraints make the problem difficult to solve. To resolve this issue, We proposed a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that achieves superior performance over the baseline, a power minimization algorithm. Our simulation results show that our proposed SCA algorithm improves performance by as much as 107.1% over the baseline, indicating that energy efficient beamforming design is essential for the next-generation wireless systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227794.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient beamforming design with SWIPT for heterogeneous cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227794/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient beamforming design with SWIPT for heterogeneous cellular networks","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451579","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient beamforming design with SWIPT for heterogeneous cellular networks","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p802wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058137S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227795,"authors":[{"name":"Juwendo Denis","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom/Telecom SudParis CNRS UMR, SAMOVAR"],"firstName":"Juwendo","lastName":"Denis","id":"38666372600"},{"name":"Sinda Smirani","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom/Telecom SudParis CNRS UMR, SAMOVAR"],"firstName":"Sinda","lastName":"Smirani","id":"37399480800"},{"name":"Bakarime Diomande","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom/Telecom SudParis CNRS UMR, SAMOVAR"],"firstName":"Bakarime","lastName":"Diomande","id":"37086282649"},{"name":"Takoua Ghariani","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom/Telecom SudParis CNRS UMR, SAMOVAR"],"firstName":"Takoua","lastName":"Ghariani","id":"37601306000"},{"name":"Badii Jouaber","affiliation":["Institut Mines-Telecom/Telecom SudParis CNRS UMR, SAMOVAR"],"firstName":"Badii","lastName":"Jouaber","id":"37297909300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227795","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Optimization","Wireless communication","Multicast communication","Signal processing algorithms","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","array signal processing","cellular radio","concave programming","convex programming","multicast communication","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited signaling exchanges","successive convex approximation","physical layer multicasting","multicell multicast networks","energy-efficient coordinated beamforming","beamformer design","NP-hard problem","active user outage constraints","global energy-efficiency maximization","single antenna users","common information","single beamformer","multiple antennas","downlink channel distribution information","statistical CSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-cell multicasting","outage probability","convex approximation","beamforming"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient coordinated beamforming for multi-cell multicast networks under statistical CSI","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227795","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227795","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the problem of energy-efficiency for physical layer multicasting in multi-cell network under the assumption that only downlink channel distribution information (CDI) is available at the base station.

The problem is formulated as the global energy-efficiency maximization under each active user' outage constraints. To circumvent the high computational complexity incurred by investigating the NP-hard problem, we leverage the concept of successive convex approximation to tackle the original non-convex problem.

Cascade design is used for IA precoder design, where the first component precoder is obtained by MSE minimization and the second component of the cascade precoder is computed using zero forcing to null the intra-group interference. The resultant design is iterated to obtain the optimal precoder-decoder for IA. In simulations, the algorithm is analyzed for convergence, SNR behavior, and precoder initialization sensitiveness. It can be seen that the sum rate of the algorithm is non-decreasing in each iteration and performs better than the least squares based IA algorithm for IBC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the MMSE precoder design for interference alignment in MIMO interfering broadcast channel","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227797","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227797.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the MMSE precoder design for interference alignment in MIMO interfering broadcast channel","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227797/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451487","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the MMSE precoder design for interference alignment in MIMO interfering broadcast channel","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p818garg.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080317S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227798,"authors":[{"name":"Shigenori Kinjo","affiliation":["Japan Coast Guard Academy, Kure, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigenori","lastName":"Kinjo","id":"37086272108"},{"name":"Shuichi Ohno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Higshihiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Ohno","id":"37086265826"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227798","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally efficient algorithm","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","bit error rate performance","user stream permutations","optimal permutation pattern","optimal user stream permutation","MU-MIMO system","ZF-THP scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO","ZF-THP","sum-rate","unequal bit allocation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for downlink (DL) multiuser (MU) MIMO systems using a new zero-forcing (ZF) Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) scheme maximizing a sum-rate.

User stream permutations, which determine the order of the interference cancellation at the transmitter, is incorporated into the ZF-THP; then, we can select a permutation pattern so as to maximize the sum-rate. Since searching for an optimal permutation pattern is computationally cumbersome, we propose an efficient algorithm, which produces almost optimal user stream permutation, for the ZF-THP.

The simulation results show that compared with the benchmark schemes, directional modulation results in lower power consumption and symbol error rate using the less stringent extended detection regions and interference-free capability, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227801","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227801.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO directional modulation M-QAM precoding for transceivers performance enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227801/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO directional modulation M-QAM precoding for transceivers performance enhancement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451520","htmlLink":"/document/8227801/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO directional modulation M-QAM precoding for transceivers performance enhancement","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p838kalantari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068601S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227803,"authors":[{"name":"Alexis A.

However, the strong path loss attenuation and the limited transmission power affect the maximum number of carriers that can be activated. A simple way to address this limitation consists in transmitting the same message from multiple transmission points, using Joint-Transmission (JT) Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP). However, the distance-frequency-dependent molecular absorption that THz channels experience makes the implementation of JT-CoMP challenging. In this paper, we propose a decentralized scheme that takes into account the effect of distance to select the per-carrier transmit beamforming weights and powers. For this purpose, low-rate feedback information is reported from the receiver to the transmission points, such that decisions performed locally take into account the ones made in the coordinated set. Notable sum data rate gains are observed when compared to the baseline schemes, where transmission power is equally divided among carriers or independently allocated using waterfilling. As expected, the accuracy of the reported channel phase information, the number active transmission points, and the distance-dependent frequency selectivity of the THz channel affect the sum data rate that multi-carrier JT-CoMP can provide.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227803","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227803.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227803","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance-aware coordinated multi-point transmission for terahertz band communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227803","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distance-aware coordinated multi-point transmission for terahertz band communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227803/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227803/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451453","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance-aware coordinated multi-point transmission for terahertz band communication","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p848dowhuszko.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076706S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8227805,"authors":[{"name":"Heesu Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Heesu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085904410"},{"name":"Hyungsik Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungsik","lastName":"Han","id":"37085905694"},{"name":"Hyuncheol Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuncheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37085441923"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227805","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Dispersion","Time-domain analysis","Frequency-domain analysis","Pulse shaping methods","Interference","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel bank filters","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel waveform design","quadrature amplitude modulation based filter-bank multicarrier","conventional QAM-FBMC systems","designed filter","superior spectral efficiency","QAM-FBMC system","conventional multiple prototype filters","number filter coefficients"]}],"abstract":"Due to its spectral efficiency and well-localized spectrum, a quadrature amplitude modulation based filter-bank multi-carrier (QAM-FBMC) is considered as one of the candidate for 5G mobile communications.

These expressions can be used for understanding and comparison of the effects of geometric and probabilistic shaping techniques on the power distribution of the transmitted signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On PAPR characteristics of DFT-s-OFDM with geometric and probabilistic constellation shaping","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227810","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227810.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","displayDocTitle":"On PAPR characteristics of DFT-s-OFDM with geometric and probabilistic constellation shaping","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227810/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451582","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On PAPR characteristics of DFT-s-OFDM with geometric and probabilistic constellation shaping","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p883kakkavas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053194S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227811,"authors":[{"name":"Anastasios Kakkavas","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Kakkavas","id":"37086157304"},{"name":"Mario Casta\u00f1eda","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Casta\u00f1eda","id":"37396186200"},{"name":"Jian Luo","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086304444"},{"name":"Tobias Laas","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Laas","id":"37085533216"},{"name":"Wen Xu","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, German Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086297915"},{"name":"Josef A.

However, at such high frequencies, phase noise (PHN) can significantly affect the performance of the communication system. Filter Bank Multi-Carrier systems with Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (FBMC-OQAM) have received increased attention in recent years, but the impact of PHN on them has not yet been extensively studied. In this work, we derive analytic expressions for the interference power, under perfect Common Phase Error (CPE) correction of the OQAM symbols. Numerical evaluation of these expressions shows that FBMC-OQAM is more robust against PHN than Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Cyclic Prefix (CP-OFDM). A pilot-based and a pilot-free method are investigated for compensation of the CPE. The latter exploits the structure of the interference in FBMC-OQAM systems. Our numerical results corroborate the efficiency of the algorithm, making FBMC-OQAM an attractive option, as high performance is achievable with no loss in spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227811","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227811.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FBMC-OQAM with phase noise: Achievable performance and compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227811/","displayDocTitle":"FBMC-OQAM with phase noise: Achievable performance and compensation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451516","htmlLink":"/document/8227811/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FBMC-OQAM with phase noise: Achievable performance and compensation","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p888kakkavas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070302S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227812,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Nissel","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Nissel","id":"37085480413"},{"name":"Jiri Blumenstein","affiliation":["Vysoke uceni technicke v Brne, Brno, Moravskoslezsk\u00c3\u00bd, CZ"],"firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Blumenstein"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227812","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","computational complexity","Hadamard transforms","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","spread spectrum communication","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity MIMO","FBMC-OQAM","biggest obstacles","complex orthogonality","spreading process","low computational complexity","spreading length","frequency blocks","block frequency spreading approach","filter bank multicarrier system","multiple-input multiple-output system","fast Walsh-Hadamard transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FBMC-OQAM","MIMO","Walsh-Hadamard Coding","Multipath channels","Time-varying channels"]}],"abstract":"Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC) offers better spectral properties than conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). However, the lack of Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) compatibility is one of its biggest obstacles. By spreading symbols in frequency, we are able to restore complex orthogonality in FBMC, so that all MIMO methods known in OFDM can be straightforwardly applied. The spreading process itself has low computational complexity because it is based on a Fast-Walsh-Hadamard transform, thus completely free of multiplications. Orthogonality only holds if the channel is approximately frequency flat within the spreading length. We thus suggest the usage of frequency blocks which are separated by a guard subcarrier. We also investigate the effect of a doubly selective channel on our block frequency spreading approach. Finally, MIMO simulations validate the applicability.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227812","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block frequency spreading: A method for low-complexity MIMO in FBMC-OQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block frequency spreading: A method for low-complexity MIMO in FBMC-OQAM","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 July 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227812/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17451527","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block frequency spreading: A method for low-complexity MIMO in FBMC-OQAM","confLoc":"Sapporo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p893nissel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049242S","chronDate":"3-6 July 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187162","isNumber":"8227634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187162","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8227634","articleId":"8227812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227813,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Qian","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085782998"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijinz Jiaotonz University"],"firstName":"Gongpu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549100"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Hongbo Zhu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37289613500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3009-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3008-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3010-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"8227813","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Backscatter","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors","Power system reliability","Probability","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","error statistics","Internet of Things","phase shift keying","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unknown data symbols","pilot symbols","ambient signal","detection thresholds","CG source","PSK source","constellation design","semicoherent detector","ambient backscatter communication","detection-required parameters","energy detector","phase shift keying","analytical BER","outage probability","error floor","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambient backscatter","semi-coherent detection","BER","outage probability","Internet of Things"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227813","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187162/8227634/08227813.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2017.8227813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-coherent detector of ambient backscatter communication for the Internet of Things","abstract":"We study the semi-coherent detection of a novel communication mechanism, ambient backscatter, where detection-required parameters can be obtained from unknown data symbols and a few pilot symbols.

In this work we apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the challenging task of both 2D and 3D face recognition. We constructed two CNN models, namely CNN-1 (two convolutional layers) and CNN-2 (one convolutional layer) for testing on 2D and 3D dataset. A comprehensive parametric study of two CNN models on face recognition is represented in which different combinations of activation function, learning rate and filter size are investigated. We find that CNN-2 has a better accuracy performance on both 2D and 3D face recognition. Our experimental results show that an accuracy of 85.15% was accomplished using CNN-2 on depth images with FRGCv2.0 dataset (4950 images with 557 objectives). An accuracy of 95% was achieved using CNN-2 on 2D raw image with the AT&T dataset (400 images with 40 objectives). The results indicate that the proposed CNN model is capable to handle complex information from facial images in different dimensions.

Selective mapping (SLM) has been commonly employed to reduce the PAPR. However, SLM requires side information (SI) which reduce the bandwidth efficiency. A low-complexity cyclic SLM (C-SLM) scheme without SI which uses delay correlation and matched filter, called C-SLM-DC-MF, has been proposed in the literature. This paper examines the effects of cyclic shift resolution of the OFDM system with C-SLM-DC-MF scheme on the system performance, in terms of PAPR reduction, accuracy, and bit error rate (BER). Simulation results show that higher resolution leads to lower PAPR reduction but better accuracy and BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227853","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08227853.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic shift resolution effects on OFDM system employing cyclic-SLM with delayed correlation and matched filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227853/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic shift resolution effects on OFDM system employing cyclic-SLM with delayed correlation and matched filter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449478","htmlLink":"/document/8227853/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic shift resolution effects on OFDM system employing cyclic-SLM with delayed correlation and matched filter","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p153pamungkasari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046295S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8227853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227866,"authors":[{"name":"Mrinmoy Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mrinmoy","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37085658505"},{"name":"Anik Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Anik","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37086177493"},{"name":"Aqeeb Iqbal Arka","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Aqeeb Iqbal","lastName":"Arka","id":"37086175136"},{"name":"A.

A bio-inspired neuromorphic circuit system which can be used for pattern recognition has been presented in this paper. A new supervised learning approach technique with a unique control circuit has been developed to train the system to recognize particular patterns which use memristor as synapses and CMOS operational amplifiers as neurons. Each memristor block, which accounts for a single pattern, contains 30 weighted synapses corresponds to one pixel in a 6\u00d75 pixels image. The memristor synapses then weight the voltage pulses that are derived from the pixel values and summed by the output neurons, to be compared with a certain threshold voltage above which an output neuron fires, thus correctly identifying the test image. A system is developed with for 10 patterns (30 memristors corresponding to one pattern) and successful demonstration is shown by training and testing images of numbers from 0 to 9.","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08227866.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new supervised learning approach for visual pattern recognition using discrete circuit elements and memristor array","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A new supervised learning approach for visual pattern recognition using discrete circuit elements and memristor array","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449911","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8227866/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new supervised learning approach for visual pattern recognition using discrete circuit elements and memristor array","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p223sarkar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064312S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8227866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227869,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjeet Kumar Subudhi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sanjeet Kumar","lastName":"Subudhi","id":"37086307203"},{"name":"Somnath Maity","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Somnath","lastName":"Maity","id":"38260003900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8227869","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"Amplitude death (AD) is a coupling induced stabilization of the fixed point (FP) of a dynamical system.

In future, frequency reuse will be enabled by advanced technologies like device-to-device (D2D) communication which will allow eNB-free data exchange between end devices. However, the first challenge for devices to establish D2D links will be to \u201ddiscover\u201d each other in a distributed manner. Even with the availability of network infrastructure, the distributed discovery will offload eNB's processing burden. However, due to the autonomous selection of resources for discovery, issues like half-duplexing and resource-collision will prevent efficient device discovery. In this paper, we present an autonomous method for discovery resources selection by modifying the standard frame structure. Our scheme introduces an additional randomness to the discovery process, which tends to mitigate half-duplexing and collision. The results have shown that the proposed scheme improves D2D discovery compared to conventional method, especially with low SINR and for larger DUE communication range.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227935","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08227935.pdf","startPage":"614","endPage":"618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed device discovery in ProSe environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed device discovery in ProSe environments","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449875","htmlLink":"/document/8227935/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed device discovery in ProSe environments","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p614jaffry.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047274S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8227935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8227949,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This algorithm is a modification to the conventional Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) algorithm. Conventional SAD uses absolute difference between block of pixels in reference image and the other image to calculate the disparity cost function. The number of computations can be significantly reduced by taking the Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT) of the block of pixels and using only the lower frequency components of DCT for SAD calculation. An architecture which can perform these DCT and SAD could save the power up to 23% making it suitable for real time robotic applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power architecture of real time stereo vision algorithm using discrete cosine transform","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227949","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08227949.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A low power architecture of real time stereo vision algorithm using discrete cosine transform","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227949/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449836","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low power architecture of real time stereo vision algorithm using discrete cosine transform","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p689dhanaraj.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058293S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8227949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8227953,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Kishore Kodali","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, WARANGAL, INDIA"],"firstName":"Ravi Kishore","lastName":"Kodali","id":"38552824600"},{"name":"Kopulwar Shishir Mahesh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Warangal, WARANGAL, INDIA"],"firstName":"Kopulwar Shishir","lastName":"Mahesh","id":"37085992351"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8227953","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"abstract":"The Internet of Things is one of the trending technologies wherein connecting any device to the Internet and control power to any appliance and in addition possess capability of connecting those appliances to each other in creating a network.

It thus strengthens our present day Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) by quickly classifying the attack. Datasets like KDD-CUP 99, Kyoto 2006+, iCTF, DEFCON, NSL-KDD are available for experiments. However, most of them are not license-free and some are unlabeled. Here we have carried out the experiments on KDD-CUP 99 dataset. The major contribution of the paper is to determine the most appropriate feature selection algorithm to select the relevant features from 41 attributes of the connection vector.

Physical layer security is playing a very important role in increasing the security of our network. Most of the security algorithms are implemented in the upper layers of the network. Physical layer security is adding much security to the existing security on the upper layers. There have been lack in the implementation of physical layer security algorithms. This paper evaluate error correcting codes in term of physical layer security. The paper is examining the security of the error correcting codes in term of bit error rate and complexity (processing time). This paper compare non systematic scrambling t-error method with t-error correcting codes without scrambling and try to analyze the result. This paper provides the processing time that showed Reed Solomon without scrambling is better option for security than other error correcting codes with scrambling such as BCH due to the short time that it takes for processing. By showing this result we are proving that Reed Solomon has the least complexity among other error correcting code in term of physical layer security.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227981","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08227981.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8227981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8227981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of physical layer security over different t-error correcting codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8227981/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of physical layer security over different t-error correcting codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8227981/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449872","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of physical layer security over different t-error correcting codes","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p875magzoubalbashier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08361S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8227981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228001,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed A.

They have played a pivotal role in development and advancement of technologies such as GPS Navigation, Disaster Management Systems, Telemedicine services, Tele-education services, TV Broadcasting services etc. With advancements in these technologies there is a need for robust communication system that is capable of delivering stable and reliable data continually with constraints in hardware resources, communication bandwidth, transmission power and channel nonlinearity. To meet these requirements selection of precise modulation scheme is essential. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a reconfigurable modulator which is capable of performing modulation schemes that can effectively counter the limitations listed above. The proposed modulator can perform modulation schemes such as Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), Minimum Shift Keying (MSK), Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) and Unbalanced Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (UQPSK). Reconfiguration is an advanced technique for system design, wherein the same hardware resources can be reconfigured to provide different functionalities. The proposed modulator can dynamically reconfigure between modulation schemes as per the user requirement without any changes in the hardware. The proposed modulator is implemented on Virtex-5 FPGA. It is observed that 36.70-70.71 % of hardware resource and 70.253 % of power is saved by implementing the proposed reconfigurable modulator over conventional non-reconfigurable modulator.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","frequency shift keying","minimum shift keying","quadrature phase shift keying","reconfigurable architectures","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Disaster Management Systems","Telemedicine services","Tele-education services","TV Broadcasting services","robust communication system","hardware resources","communication bandwidth","transmission power","modulation schemes","Frequency Shift Keying","Minimum Shift Keying","Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying","Unbalanced Quadrature Phase Shift Keying","nonreconfigurable modulator","FPGA based reconfigurable modulator","satellite applications","information transmission systems","FSK","MSK","OQPSK","UQPSK","Virtex-5 FPGA","GPS Navigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite Modulator","Reconfigurable FPGA","Signal Processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228082","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228082","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1432","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228082.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228082/","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of FPGA based reconfigurable modulator for satellite applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17449906","htmlLink":"/document/8228082/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of FPGA based reconfigurable modulator for satellite applications","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p1427bhandarkar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.155329S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228109,"authors":[{"name":"Chuppala Harish","affiliation":["Bharat Electronics"],"firstName":"Chuppala","lastName":"Harish","id":"37086287210"},{"name":"Rajasekar Mohan","affiliation":["PES University"],"firstName":"Rajasekar","lastName":"Mohan","id":"37086294425"},{"name":"R Shashank","affiliation":["Amrita University"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Shashank","id":"37086285974"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8228109","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":649},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Receivers","OFDM","Frequency modulation","Frequency-domain analysis","IEEE Regions","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","error statistics","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","synchronisation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain","OFDM receivers","wireless transmitter","local oscillator","standard-compliant communication systems","IEEE 802.11ac","Analog-to-Digital conversion operation","sampling frequency","carrier frequency offset","wireless receiver","sampling clock offset estimation","Digital to Analog Conversion","CFO","ADC","DAC","modulation scheme","channel signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CFO","SNR","BER","offset PPM"]}],"abstract":"Carrier frequency offset often occurs between wireless transmitter and receiver due to mismatch between the local oscillator in each of them. Standard-compliant communication systems define outer limits of tolerance of this mismatch expressed in parts per million (PPM). For high throughput systems like IEEE 802.11ac, this tolerance range is quite narrow. To meet such stringent specifications, number of techniques for correction of carrier frequency offset (CFO) are in practice, with varying degrees of complexity and compromise. Sampling clock is used for Analog-to-Digital conversion (ADC) operation in receivers and in Digital to Analog Conversion (DAC) in the transmitters which invariably are not synchronized. In this paper, a different method is proposed for correcting the sampling clock offset (SCO) in frequency domain with an assumption that same source is utilized for generating both carrier frequency for down-conversion and the sampling frequency used for (ADC) operation in the receivers. Depending upon the choice of modulation scheme, channel Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), Bit Error Rate (BER) and acceptable offset PPM, hardware designs suiting the requirement and compatible with algorithm adopted are suggested. This method has distinct advantages for different degrees of complexity of design vis-a-vis data rate.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228109","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228109.pdf","startPage":"1583","endPage":"1587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling clock offset estimation and correction in frequency domain for OFDM receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228109/","displayDocTitle":"Sampling clock offset estimation and correction in frequency domain for OFDM receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449781","htmlLink":"/document/8228109/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling clock offset estimation and correction in frequency domain for OFDM receivers","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p1583chuppala.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055049S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228115,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Shi","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Shi","id":"37275990500"},{"name":"Siew Weng Leong","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siew Weng","lastName":"Leong","id":"37696894000"},{"name":"Bin Luo","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37068812200"},{"name":"Wenjiang Wang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wenjiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37656678900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8228115","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Predistortion","Voltage control","Phase measurement","Nonlinear distortion","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","microwave power amplifiers","millimetre wave power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF predistortion linearizer","independent control","optimal distortion compensation","Ka-band solid-state power amplifier","phase-gain response","gain expansion control","AM-AM nonlinearity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["linearization","RF predistortion","power amplifiers","non-linear distortion","third order intermodulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new architecture for RF predistortion linearizer that has the novel feature to provide independent control of phase/gain response for achieving optimal distortion compensation.

However, when the gain expansion is adjusted, the phase response will also change. This leads to the power amplifier not being optimally compensated. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a RF predistortion linearizer that features an independent control of gain/phase response.

MI is depicted in elevated ST-segment, wide pathological Q wave and inversion of T wave in electrocardiogram (ECG). This paper presents a multiscale energy based method for detection of MI. Detection of MI by consideration of fewer ECG leads requires prior information of the pathological characteristics of the disease. Thus, here we have considered all the 12 leads of the ECG signal simultaneously for detection of MI. Wavelet transform of all the leads of MI decomposes the signal into subbands of different order. The multiscale energy of all the bands are computed and the normalized multiscale energy of the wavelet coefficients are considered. The pathological structure present in the ECG data alters the covariance structure of the subband matrix and thus changes in the feature parameters of the signal occur, which leads to detection of MI. The results are presented using the standard MI ECG data from PTB diagnostic database.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228121","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228121.pdf","startPage":"1640","endPage":"1645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of myocardial infarction using wavelet transform and multiscale energy analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228121/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of myocardial infarction using wavelet transform and multiscale energy analysis","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17434049","htmlLink":"/document/8228121/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of myocardial infarction using wavelet transform and multiscale energy analysis","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p1640swain.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051979S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228122,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Kun Tseng","affiliation":["Cardiology division, Tri-Service General Hospital Songshan Branch, Songshan Dist., Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C.","Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chin-Kun","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37086316467"},{"name":"Lih-Jen Kau","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Lih-Jen","lastName":"Kau","id":"37265060500"},{"name":"Wei-Yen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wei-Yen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086319253"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8228122","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Prediction algorithms","Encoding","IEEE Regions","Conferences","Databases","Fuzzy neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","database management systems","electrocardiography","fuzzy neural nets","medical signal detection","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG signal","ECG waveform","original prediction errors","nondistortion compression","MIT-BIH arrhythmia ECG database","compression ratio","adjacent heartbeat","electrocardiogram periodicity","R-wave identification","ECG predictive coding algorithm","real-time applications","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy neural network-based predictive coding scheme","electrocardiogram signal","efficient lossless ECG compression method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228122","abstract":"In this paper, we present an efficient lossless ECG compression method for real-time applications.

The penetration of wind energy into grid is increasing day by day. In order to carry huge amount of wind power during the grid integration of large scale wind farms, high transmission line capability is demanded. In order to improve the power carrying capability of the transmission line and to improve the stability of the system, series compensation is the best practical solution. Series compensation can result in Sub-Synchronous Resonance (SSR) oscillations in the electrical system which will lead to damages in the system such as shaft failure. In this paper, a novel idea of using the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) based adaptive neuro controller is proposed for damping SSR oscillations in grid connected windfarms. The controller is trained in real time without a reference model. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is tested under varying series compensation, wind speeds and grid impedance conditions and it has been proved that the proposed controller performs far better than any other linear controllers.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228133","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1707","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228133.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RTRL based adaptive neuro-controller for damping SSR oscillations in SCIG based windfarms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"RTRL based adaptive neuro-controller for damping SSR oscillations in SCIG based windfarms","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228133/","accessionNumber":"17449864","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228133/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RTRL based adaptive neuro-controller for damping SSR oscillations in SCIG based windfarms","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p1702sindhuthampatty.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051976S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8228151,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Char Juin","affiliation":["Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Singapore"],"firstName":"Chin Char","lastName":"Juin","id":"37086286473"},{"name":"Richard Xiong Jun Wei","affiliation":["Hwa Chong Institution, Singapore"],"firstName":"Richard Xiong Jun","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086294049"},{"name":"Luis Fernando D'Haro","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Luis Fernando","lastName":"D'Haro","id":"37085352758"},{"name":"Rafael E.

The dynamic use of available spectrum bands needs proper spectrum handoff mechanism for switching to different operating frequencies based on vacant channels. Therefore, blocking probability, switching or handoff delay, link maintenance and failure probability are the important spectrum handoff performance metrics in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we derive analytical formulae of blocking probability, link maintenance, and failure probability of a cognitive user in opportunistic and negotiated network scenarios with backup channels. The impact of switching delay on these derived performance parameters is also presented in different network scenarios.

However, increased filter order may cause resonance which may affect the stability of the system and result in poor dynamics. In addition, the resonance effect requires the proper design of LCL-filter and may put a limit on maximum bandwidth achieved with single loop PI control. With converter side current as feedback, the delay in the loop gain further deteriorates the stability of the controller if the higher resonance frequency is adopted for the design. Due to such discrepancy, different controller structures are suggested for L-filter and LCL-filter type GcC with conventional PI control. In this paper, model-independent linear active disturbance rejection control for LCL-filter based GcC is introduced. It is explained by frequency response analysis that the characteristics of the control even with change in the resonance frequency by adopting different filter capacitance. The proposed method treats the system as a simple integrator by estimating all the dynamics of the system with linear extended state observer and compensating them in the control law of ADRC. The robustness of the proposed controller is compared with the conventional PI controller and verified under different filter parameters via simulation and hardware prototype.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228171","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228171.pdf","startPage":"1913","endPage":"1918","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust resonance damping of LCL-filter based grid-connected converter with linear active disturbance rejection control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A robust resonance damping of LCL-filter based grid-connected converter with linear active disturbance rejection control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228171/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449598","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228171/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust resonance damping of LCL-filter based grid-connected converter with linear active disturbance rejection control","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p1913saleem.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068055S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8228186,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Kyle Y.

The algorithm generates smooth paths consisting of continuous piecewise B\u00e9zier curves in real time. Specifically, a RRT-based waypoint generation algorithm is firstly proposed for the exploration of collision-free waypoints successively during flight. Besides, a novel real-time path smoothing technique is developed to generate continuous collision-free paths that satisfy the motion constraints of UAVs. This is achieved by fitting B\u00e9zier curves between consecutive waypoints based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Lastly, a path selection strategy is also introduced to seek for an optimum path when multiple solutions are available. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed real-time three-dimensional smooth path planning algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228192.pdf","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2022","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time three-dimensional smooth path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles in completely unknown cluttered environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Real-time systems","Smoothing methods","Heuristic algorithms","IEEE Regions","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace navigation","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","clutter","curve fitting","mobile robots","particle swarm optimisation","path planning","piecewise linear techniques","smoothing methods","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicles","UAVs","completely unknown cluttered environments","collision-free waypoints","continuous collision-free paths","particle swarm optimization algorithm","path selection strategy","rapidly-exploring random trees","motion constraints","PSO algorithm","continuous piecewise B\u00e9zier curve fitting","RRT-based waypoint generation algorithm","real-time three-dimensional smooth path planning algorithm","autonomous navigation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Real-time three-dimensional smooth path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles in completely unknown cluttered environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228192/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449614","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time three-dimensional smooth path planning for unmanned aerial vehicles in completely unknown cluttered environments","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2017wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062843S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228214,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Grid integrated wind farm undergoes many technical challenges. Wind farms need long transmission line for the grid integration. As long transmission line exhibits high inductive reactance, capacitive series compensation is required to improve the transmission capacity. Insertion of capacitive compensation in a line causes Sub Synchronous Resonance (SSR) Oscillations in the system. These oscillations may lead to a permanent damage in the turbine-shaft system. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy based adaptive controller for Rotor Side Converter (RSC) and Grid Side Converter (GSC) for damping SSR oscillations in a grid connected DFIG based wind farm. The paper describes the development of a mathematical model of the proposed system in detail and small signal stability for SSR oscillations is analyzed using Eigen value approach. Oscillation. Performance of the proposed controller is tested under varying operating conditions and it has been observed that the fuzzy based controller adopts the changes in the system operating conditions and gives satisfactory performance compared with conventional PI controller.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228214","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228214.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2143","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy based adaptive controller for grid connected DFIG based windfarm for damping SSR oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy based adaptive controller for grid connected DFIG based windfarm for damping SSR oscillations","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228214/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449729","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228214/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy based adaptive controller for grid connected DFIG based windfarm for damping SSR oscillations","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2138sindhuthampatty.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042978S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8228243,"authors":[{"name":"Shrishail M Hiremath","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Shrishail M","lastName":"Hiremath","id":"38196791900"},{"name":"Sarat Kumar Patra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Sarat Kumar","lastName":"Patra","id":"37368553400"},{"name":"Tulsi Prasad Sahu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Tulsi Prasad","lastName":"Sahu","id":"37086274542"},{"name":"Amit Kumar Mishra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37290432700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8228243","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Sensors","Covariance matrices","Antennas","Cognitive radio","IEEE Regions","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order eigenvalue-moment-ratio based blind spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","blind spectrum sensing techniques","EMR technique","fourth order moment","random matrix theory","asymptotic test statistic distribution","detection probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","Random Matrix Theory (RMT)","Eigenvalue","Blind Spectrum sensing","AGM","SLE","EMR","ROC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228243","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228243","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","abstract":"This paper presents the application of higher order eigenvalue moment ratio based blind spectrum sensing to the cognitive radio.

The effectiveness of this method was tested in a computer simulation and verified using real quadrotors.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228246","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228246.pdf","startPage":"2307","endPage":"2312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle avoidance algorithm for swarm of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle using artificial potential fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228246","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228246/","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle avoidance algorithm for swarm of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle using artificial potential fields","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449520","htmlLink":"/document/8228246/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle avoidance algorithm for swarm of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle using artificial potential fields","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2307galvez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070544S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228272,"authors":[{"name":"Joon Huang Chuah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Joon Huang","lastName":"Chuah","id":"37085573955"},{"name":"Hui Ying Khaw","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hui Ying","lastName":"Khaw","id":"37085803011"},{"name":"Foo Chong Soon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Foo Chong","lastName":"Soon","id":"37085805419"},{"name":"Chee-Onn Chow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chee-Onn","lastName":"Chow","id":"37290819800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8228272","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":467},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228272","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian noise","Image denoising","Training","Noise reduction","Noise level","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image denoising","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural network","Gaussian noise detection","noise level classification","denoising algorithms","standard test images","noise levels","denoising approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image noise","noise detection","convolutional neural networks","training","Gaussian noise"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228272","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228272.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","startPage":"2447","endPage":"2450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Gaussian noise and its level using deep convolutional neural network","abstract":"This study presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to effectively recognize the presence of Gaussian noise and its level in images.

We used 12000 and 3000 standard test images for training and testing purposes, respectively. Different noise levels are introduced to these images.

Image compression algorithm, like JPEG2000, utilizes the Forward Discrete Wavelet Transform (FDWT) and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT). The main problems face by researchers in the hardware implementation of the FDWT/IDWT are storage memory, internal processing buffer and the limitation of the FPGA resources. Memory access method significantly affects the design architecture of FDWT/IDWT. The off-chip memory access consumes more power while the on-chip memory increases the hardware cost. In this paper, we propose an FDWT/IDWT architecture that is based on the line-based and dual-scan methods. Both architectures reduce the number of image memory accesses. The line-based architecture reduces the internal buffer by 2 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 N where N is the dimension of image size. The implemented dual-scan architecture does not use any the internal memory. Both architectures were implemented on the Altera Cyclone II EP2C70F672C6 FPGA board and ran at frequency of 100 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228296","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","startPage":"2576","endPage":"2581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient FDWT/IDWT hardware implementation with line-based and dual-scan image memory accesses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient FDWT/IDWT hardware implementation with line-based and dual-scan image memory accesses","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228296/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449784","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient FDWT/IDWT hardware implementation with line-based and dual-scan image memory accesses","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2576ahmed.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066694S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228299,"authors":[{"name":"T.

As a result of that, the location of non-zeros elements in the sparse vector (s-vector) does not infer about the true class of the test vector unlike the sparse representation classification (SRC) over the exemplar dictionary. Thus, in our earlier works employing the learned dictionary for language recognition (LR), the s-vectors are required to be processed for classification. In this work, we explore SRC over discriminative learned dictionary for LR. For this purpose, the language-specific training i-vectors are used to create the language-specific learned dictionary. These language-specific dictionaries are then concatenated to form a composite discriminative dictionary. For sparse coding, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net (ENet) algorithms are explored. The regularized multiclass logistic regression is employed for score calibration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on NIST 2009 language recognition evaluation data set in closed set condition on 30 seconds duration segments.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228306","startPage":"2632","endPage":"2636","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228306.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse representation classification over discriminatively learned dictionary for language recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparse representation classification over discriminatively learned dictionary for language recognition","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228306/","accessionNumber":"17449760","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228306/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse representation classification over discriminatively learned dictionary for language recognition","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2632singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073733S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228314,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Martin C.

In order to have an efficient design of these systems, it is essential to perform solar resource assessment on the intended location prior to installation. Advancements in computational intelligence led to applications of artificial neural networks for solar resource assessment which outperforms existing empirical models in terms of speed and accuracy and overcomes the cost of using expensive solar radiation sensors. In this study, a single recurrent or feedback network is developed and assessed for efficacy in estimating the daily sum of solar radiation in the Philippines using meteorological data such as daily sum of sunshine duration, daily mean air temperature, daily mean air pressure, and daily mean air humidity. The collected data used in this study were obtained for the year 2014 from the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM) Agro-meteorological Station Lufft sensors in three locations: (1) Tanay, Rizal, (2) Barili, Cebu, and (3) Sto. Tomas, Davao del Norte. The developed model responded with mean squared error (MSE) values of 0.1491, 0.1679, and 0.2297 and regression values of 0.9146, 0.9313, and 0.9277 for the training, validation, and testing phases. The error histogram also shows that low values of error exist for each dataset and most errors fall between the ranges of -0.4581 to 0.5646. Results may further be improved by having larger data for training, validation, and testing phases for the neural network which can make the model more robust for larger variations in the weather patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228314","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228314.pdf","startPage":"2672","endPage":"2676","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network model for solar resource assessment: An application to efficient design of photovoltaic system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network model for solar resource assessment: An application to efficient design of photovoltaic system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17434029","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228314/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network model for solar resource assessment: An application to efficient design of photovoltaic system","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2672santiago.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050551S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8228333,"authors":[{"name":"Dionis A.

Using state machines implemented in Verilog - a hardware description language and MATLAB for verification purposes, the said eye tracking system was built. State machines are very relevant in creating the logical circuits for the process algorithm of the system. Even in a low-end FPGA, the study comprising of several processes such as Thinning Algorithm and Hough Transform was accomplished. MATLAB has its significance to improve the checking of data gathered from every algorithm sequence in the system. Having no significant difference on the eye centers detected from the FPGA and MATLAB implementations, the study proved to be successful in terms of an FPGA implementation of the eye tracking system.

Since food monitoring plays a leading role in health-related problems, it is becoming more essential in our day-to-day lives. In this paper, an approach has been presented to classify images of food using convolutional neural networks. Unlike the traditional artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks have the capability of estimating the score function directly from image pixels. A 2D convolution layer has been utilised which creates a convolution kernel that is convolved with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs. There are multiple such layers, and the outputs are concatenated at parts to form the final tensor of outputs. We also use the Max-Pooling function for the data, and the features extracted from this function are used to train the network. An accuracy of 86.97% for the classes of the FOOD-101 dataset is recognised using the proposed implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228338","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228338.pdf","startPage":"2801","endPage":"2806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Food classification from images using convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228338/","displayDocTitle":"Food classification from images using convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228338/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449430","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Food classification from images using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2801attokaren.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098476S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228349,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Mohammed Fahad","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Systems & Software Engineering, Uinversiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Mohammed","lastName":"Fahad","id":"37086330348"},{"name":"Abdulghani Ali Ahmed","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Systems & Software Engineering, Uinversiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Abdulghani Ali","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37086087536"},{"name":"Mohd Nizam Mohmad Kahar","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Systems & Software Engineering, Uinversiti Malaysia Pahang, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Nizam Mohmad","lastName":"Kahar","id":"37086330832"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1134-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1133-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1135-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"8228349","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Monitoring","Tools","Hardware","Operating systems","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uninterrupted services","cloud computing services","scale resource utilization","system administrators","cloud services monitoring","hardware advances","software advances","cloud monitoring","cloud monitoring tools","data centers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","CPU","monitoring tools","security","DDoS attacks"]}],"abstract":"Recent advances in hardware and software of cloud computing are putting tremendous pressure on the administrators who manage these resources to provide uninterrupted services.

Over the last decade, the deep feed-forward neural network (DFNN) has almost replaced the GMM in acoustic modeling. The current ASR systems are predominantly based on the DFNN-HMM acoustic model and the n-gram language model (LM). Owing to better long-term context modeling ability, the recurrent neural network (RNN) based LMs have already been reported to yield lower perplexity than the n-gram LMs. Recently a variant of RNN, the longshort term memory (LSTM) has been successfully explored in acoustic modeling. Interestingly, the evaluation of an ASR system employing both RNN-based acoustic and linguistic modeling is yet to be reported. Further, we note that most of these advancements are explored in the context of adults' ASR only. Motivated by those works, in this paper we explore LSTM-based acoustic modeling combined with RNN-based LM for children's ASR. Our experimental results show that such combined RNN-based modeling is found effective in both matched and mismatched children's ASR tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228353","startPage":"2880","endPage":"2884","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228353.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring recurrent neural network based acoustic and linguistic modeling for children's speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228353/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploring recurrent neural network based acoustic and linguistic modeling for children's speech recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228353/","accessionNumber":"17449575","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring recurrent neural network based acoustic and linguistic modeling for children's speech recognition","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p2880sreeram.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12287S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8228367,"authors":[{"name":"Vipin Kumar Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India"],"firstName":"Vipin Kumar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086315151"},{"name":"Mohd.

It is demonstrated that the use of a Memristor instead of a resistor leads to improved oscillator characteristics. Specifically, it is shown that the frequency deviation as well as the THD is lower for Memristor-based oscillators in comparison to their resistor-based counterparts. This coupled with the smaller on-chip area offered by a Memristor would enable high-performance low frequency oscillators.

For such network, the achievable rate and power efficiency is investigated. In uplink scenario, received signals across the RS and BS are detected with zero forcing (ZF) detector. We have also chosen ZF technique for precoder design, which is utilized across the RS in end-to-end signal transmission. When statistics of channel matrix and precoding matrix are known then SNR and achievable rate can be eaisly found by using random matrix theory. In such network, performance is also measured under different cooperation protocol. We have derived the tractable lower bound for the achievable rate which has also been numerically verified. Numerical results analyze the impact of a large number of RS and BS antenna for determining the achievable rate, where total transmit power remains constant. On the other side, the impact of a total number of RS and BS antenna on power efficiency has also been investigated where variation with total power to RS antennas is observed keeping BS antenna constant and vice versa.","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8169968/8227816/08228400.pdf","startPage":"3135","endPage":"3140","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2017 - 2017 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2017.8228400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8227816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable rate and power efficiency of massive MIMO in cooperative network with ZF receivers","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cooperative communication","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficiency","RS antennas","achievable rate","ZF receivers","relay station","received signals","ZF technique","end-to-end signal transmission","precoding matrix","BS antenna","massive MIMO","cooperative network","base station","zero forcing detector","channel matrix statistics","SNR","random matrix theory","tractable lower bound","BS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct decoding","Non-cooperative decoding","Cooperative decoding","ZF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rate and power efficiency of massive MIMO in cooperative network with ZF receivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228400/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17449730","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rate and power efficiency of massive MIMO in cooperative network with ZF receivers","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p3135kumar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060305S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8169968","isNumber":"8227816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8169968","xplore-issue":"8227816","articleId":"8228400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228445,"authors":[{"name":"Naufal Suryanto","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics and Computer Engineering Electronic Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Naufal","lastName":"Suryanto","id":"37086280353"},{"name":"Chihiro Ikuta","affiliation":["Dept. of Creative Technology Engineering, Anan National College of Technology, Anan, Japan"],"firstName":"Chihiro","lastName":"Ikuta","id":"37086277671"},{"name":"Dadet Pramadihanto","affiliation":["Dept. of Informatics and Computer Engineering Electronic Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Dadet","lastName":"Pramadihanto","id":"37353702300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0716-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0717-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228445","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228445","abstract":"Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is fast and popular algorithm to find the optimum value of non-linear and multi-dimensional function.

The research issue comes from the background that most of the AI systems developed by using AI developing tools require a huge amount of training samples. In this paper, we propose a method for reducing the amount of training samples. Based on the proposed method, we created a Japanese hand-writing recognizing system to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This system is used for recognizing more than 6,000 different kinds of Japanese Kanji characters. The important feature of the system is that we do not need to collect millions of hand-writing Kanji character images as training samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by demonstration experiments.","doi":"10.1109/KCIC.2017.8228448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KCIC.2017.8228448","startPage":"13","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Electronics Symposium on Knowledge Creation and Intelligent Computing (IES-KCIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170163/8228443/08228448.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Electronics Symposium on Knowledge Creation and Intelligent Computing (IES-KCIC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for reducing the amounts of training samples for developing AI systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A method for reducing the amounts of training samples for developing AI systems","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228448/","accessionNumber":"17450176","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228448/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for reducing the amounts of training samples for developing AI systems","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"03MamiNagoya13201570381067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0676S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170163","isNumber":"8228443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170163","xplore-issue":"8228443","articleId":"8228448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8228451,"authors":[{"name":"Zaqiatud Darojah","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Zaqiatud","lastName":"Darojah","id":"37085456519"},{"name":"Endah Suryawati Ningrum","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Endah Suryawati","lastName":"Ningrum","id":"37062646500"},{"name":"Didik Setyo Purnomo","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Didik Setyo","lastName":"Purnomo","id":"37085467358"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0716-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0717-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228451","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228451","abstract":"In the previous study, we have investigated that the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has the excellennt performance and very fast learning as the training of Feedforward Neural Network (FNN).

In this contribution a newly developed SVD algorithm for polynomial matrices (PMSVD) is analyzed and compared to the commonly used SVD-based MIMO equalization. Since the PMSVD processing results in independent single-input single-output layers exhibiting a frequency-selective characteristic, a simple zero forcing equalizer or an optimal Viterbi detector is applied in this work so as to remove the occurring inter-symbol interferences. The PMSVD orthogonalization is compared with the conventional SVD in terms of the achievable spectral efficiencies, showing that there is no loss applying PMSVD over SVD processing. In addition, the bit-error rate performances in different channel scenarios are evaluated and optimized by applying combined bit and power allocation schemes. One scenario involves the measured specific impulse responses of a (2\u00d72) optical MIMO channel, consisting of a 1.4 km multi-mode fiber, optical fusion couplers for mode multiplexing and demultiplexing when operating at a wavelength of 1576 nm. The computer simulation results show that the PMSVD could be an alternative signal processing method compared to conventional SVD-based approaches in frequency-selective MIMO channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170166/8228485/08228495.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of polynomial matrix SVD-based broadband MIMO equalization in an optical multi-mode testbed","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","equalisers","error statistics","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","polynomial matrices","signal processing","singular value decomposition","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalizer","optimal Viterbi detector","PMSVD orthogonalization","conventional SVD","SVD processing","bit-error rate performances","power allocation schemes","optical fusion couplers","mode multiplexing","demultiplexing","frequency-selective MIMO channels","polynomial matrix SVD","MIMO equalization","multimode testbed","multiple-output systems","block-transmission description","spatio-temporal vector coding","polynomial matrices","PMSVD processing results","single-input single-output layers","frequency-selective characteristic","intersymbol interferences","spectral efficiencies","impulse responses","multimode fiber","signal processing method","singular value decomposition","SVD algorithm","size 1.4 km","size 1576.0 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of polynomial matrix SVD-based broadband MIMO equalization in an optical multi-mode testbed","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228495/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450306","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of polynomial matrix SVD-based broadband MIMO equalization in an optical multi-mode testbed","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p001sandmann.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087077S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170166","isNumber":"8228485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170166","xplore-issue":"8228485","articleId":"8228495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228500,"authors":[{"name":"Joris Van Kerrebrouck","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC) -

This proves the presented approach is suited to cancel self-phase modulation in coherent optical communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228500","publicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170166/8228485/08228500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228485","startPage":"32","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear MIMO impulse responses determination using pseudo random sequences, and nonlinear compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear MIMO impulse responses determination using pseudo random sequences, and nonlinear compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228500/","conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450294","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear MIMO impulse responses determination using pseudo random sequences, and nonlinear compensation","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p032vankerrebrouck.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.144795S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170166","isNumber":"8228485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170166","xplore-issue":"8228485","articleId":"8228500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228503,"authors":[{"name":"Ferhat Yarkin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ferhat","lastName":"Yarkin","id":"37085995249"},{"name":"Ibrahim Altunbas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Altunbas","id":"37443120300"},{"name":"Ertugrul Basar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ertugrul","lastName":"Basar","id":"38666344600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0585-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228503","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a cooperative relaying scheme combining space shift keying (SSK) and transmit antenna selection (TAS), and investigate its error performance.

SSK is applied by using the selected antennas. Moreover, a single-antenna relay is used to amplify the transmitted signal from the source and forward it to the destination. Considerably tight upper-bound and lower-bound expressions for the bit error probability of the proposed SSK system are derived when the number of selected antennas is two.

To support an increasing number of antennas, a CloudRAN approach that maximally aggregates base station functionality of the different antenna sites is the most economically feasible. To support light weight antenna units, analog radio-over-fiber is most promising. To mitigate linearity constraints of optical modulators, an all-digital transmitter can be used. In this paper, LTE transmission is demonstrated over 200 m OM4 multimode fiber using a VCSEL and a resonant transimpedance amplifier. The VCSEL is directly modulated with a high-speed 2-level signal generated in real-time on an FPGA. After reception of this signal, the adjacent channel power ratio was measured to be -45.6 dB. This is within the LTE specifications, proving this is a cost and power effective solution for next generation wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228510/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17450278","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228510/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Real-time all-digital radio-over-fiber LTE transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time all-digital radio-over-fiber LTE transmission","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p083vankerrebrouck.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055408S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170166","isNumber":"8228485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170166","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8228485","articleId":"8228510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228514,"authors":[{"name":"Noran Mohamed Farouk","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Technology, German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Noran Mohamed","lastName":"Farouk","id":"37086283246"},{"name":"Wassim Alexan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Technology, German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Wassim","lastName":"Alexan","id":"37085380491"},{"name":"Ahmed El-Mahdy","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Technology, German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"El-Mahdy","id":"38272064500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0585-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228514","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"Wireless communication has been rapidly developed in recent years acquiring higher demand of efficient wireless systems. Cooperative communication is considered to be capable of effectively meeting this rapid growth where the use of relays improves the throughput and ensures successful transmission to all terminals in a given system. In this paper, a Two-way Decode and Forward Relaying for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) mobile systems (TWR-DF-oFdMA) is proposed. The system consists of mobile terminals (MTs) divided into near nodes and far nodes in which the base station directly transmits to the near nodes and indirectly transmits to the far nodes by the cooperation of the near nodes which act as relays. The performance of the system is measured in terms of the bit error rate and the sum rate. It is found that the performance of TWR-DF-OFDMA is much better than that of conventional OFDMA. Furthermore, it is shown that the number of NNs in the system affects the performance of TWR-DF-OFDMA and an optimum number was found to give the highest performance of TWR-DF-OFDMA compared to conventional OFDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170166/8228485/08228514.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Way decode and forward relaying for OFDMA mobile systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Throughput","Base stations","Mobile communication","Artificial neural networks","Signal to noise ratio","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA mobile systems","wireless communication","efficient wireless systems","relays","orthogonal frequency division multiple access mobile systems","mobile terminals","TWR-DF-OFDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["two way relaying","decode and forward","multiuser","OFDMA system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Two-Way decode and forward relaying for OFDMA mobile systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228514/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450304","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Way decode and forward relaying for OFDMA mobile systems","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p102farouk.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056868S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170166","isNumber":"8228485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170166","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228485","articleId":"8228514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8228517,"authors":[{"name":"Masanori Yofune","affiliation":["Mobile Techno Corp., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Yofune","id":"37085617425"},{"name":"Satoshi Sonobe","affiliation":["Mobile Techno Corp., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Sonobe","id":"37086272095"},{"name":"Atsuhiko Sugitani","affiliation":["Mobile Techno Corp., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsuhiko","lastName":"Sugitani","id":"37086264161"},{"name":"Yasuharu Amezawa","affiliation":["Mobile Techno Corp., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuharu","lastName":"Amezawa","id":"37085462609"},{"name":"Shin-ichi Sato","affiliation":["Mobile Techno Corp., Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin-ichi","lastName":"Sato","id":"37086263656"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0585-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228517","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228517","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Phase shift keying","Parity check codes","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","parity check codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE802.11n LDPC codes","backward compatibility","WLAN devices","optimal retransmission data length","IR-harq scheme","multiband WLAN system","incremental redundancy hybrid ARQ scheme","wireless local area network system","multiband simultaneous transmission","rate compatible low-density parity-check codes","RC-LDPC","WLAN control frame","noise figure 2.9 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["retransmission scheme","IR-HARQ","multiband WLAN","rate compatible LDPC","CTS"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an incremental redundancy hybrid ARQ (IR-HARQ) scheme for the wireless local area network (WLAN) system employing multiband simultaneous transmission.

MIMO-CEM has a transmitter system with an efficient non-linear power amplifier and a receiver system with a 1-bit Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) sampled at the Intermediate Frequency (IF). In spite of the great reduction in power consumption and hardware complexity as a result of using 1-bit ADC at the receiver side, a big degradation in the bit error rate performance (BER) is observed. This was a result of using 1-bit ADC which cause a severe quantization noise. Therefore, an efficient error correction coding becomes a major to solve this problem. In this paper, a comprehensive study for channel coding technique for MIMO-CEM system is done to select the most suitable channel coding technique to improve MIMO-CEM BER performance. The evaluation of this study was done over a multipath Rayleigh fading channel with both Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) modulation and Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation. The simulation results show a significant improvement in the BER performance at low values of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) when LDPC channel coding is used while, the Convolutional Code (CC) with Viterbi Decoder achieves the best BER performance at high SNR values.","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228519","publicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170166/8228485/08228519.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of channel coding techniques for MIMO-CEM system with IF sampled 1-bit ADC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of channel coding techniques for MIMO-CEM system with IF sampled 1-bit ADC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228519/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17450298","htmlLink":"/document/8228519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of channel coding techniques for MIMO-CEM system with IF sampled 1-bit ADC","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p126amrallah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057657S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170166","isNumber":"8228485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170166","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228485","articleId":"8228519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8228521,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Aldababsa","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering, Gebze Technical University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Aldababsa","id":"37086321652"},{"name":"O\u011fuz Kucur","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering, Gebze Technical University, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuz","lastName":"Kucur","id":"37304195400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0585-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0586-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228521","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":617},"abstract":"We study outage performance of a downlink multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) in dual hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relay communication system over frequency non-selective and slow fading channels with Nakagami-m distribution.

First, a dual-stream transmission scheme under a 2-by-M (M \u2265 2) multiple-input multiple-output scenario is studied. A generalization for any number of simultaneous substreams is then built based on the initial results. We provide an approximation on the average bit error probability (ABEP). We also show that a rotation of \u03c0/4 radian applied on the BPSK signal constellation minimizes the derived approximation on ABEP.

In D2D systems, user equipments (UEs) do not necessarily communicate via evolved Node Base station (eNB); instead, they are allowed to communicate directly with each other. This underlying communication generates interference due to reusing the same resources of the conventional cellular network. Therefore, efficient interference management techniques are required to keep the interference under control. Most of the existing results assume perfect channel state information (CSI), which is considered to be an unrealistic assumption. In this paper, the problem of interference management for underlay D2D users in a two-tier heterogeneous macro-small cell network is studied assuming imperfect CSI. The effect of channel estimation error on the coverage probabilities of D2D and cellular users is investigated. We also derive an expression for the D2D optimal power that aims to maximize the coverage probability and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of both links while satisfying minimum quality of service (QoS) requirements (SINR target).","publicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170166/8228485/08228544.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"261","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2017.8228544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference management for D2D communications underlay macro-small cell networks with imperfect channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Interference management for D2D communications underlay macro-small cell networks with imperfect channel estimation","htmlLink":"/document/8228544/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17450307","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference management for D2D communications underlay macro-small cell networks with imperfect channel estimation","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p256maher.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06203S","chronDate":"2-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170166","isNumber":"8228485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170166","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228485","articleId":"8228544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":8228567,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Labiyb Afakh","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Division, Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS), Kampus PENS, Jalan Raya ITS Sukolilo, Surabaya, 60111 Indonesia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Labiyb","lastName":"Afakh","id":"37086513543"},{"name":"Anhar Risnumawan","affiliation":["Mechatronics Engineering Division"],"firstName":"Anhar","lastName":"Risnumawan","id":"37681265400"},{"name":"Martianda Erste Anggraeni","affiliation":["Department of Creative Multimedia"],"firstName":"Martianda Erste","lastName":"Anggraeni","id":"37086043729"},{"name":"Mohamad Nasyir Tamara","affiliation":["Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS)"],"firstName":"Mohamad Nasyir","lastName":"Tamara","id":"37086072900"},{"name":"Endah Suryawati Ningrum","affiliation":["Kampus PENS, Jalan Raya ITS Sukolilo, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Endah Suryawati","lastName":"Ningrum","id":"37062646500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0716-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0717-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228567","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Detectors","Manuals","Visualization","Text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","document image processing","feature extraction","history","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","text analysis","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural network","text confidence map","text lines","text analysis","scene images","ancient Javanese character","Aksara Jawa text detection system","heritage culture","Aksara Jawa text","backpropagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aksara Jawa","text detection","scene image","deep learning","convolutional neural network","joint learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228567","abstract":"Aksara jawa is an ancient Javanese character, which has been used since 17th century. The character is mostly written on stones to describe history or naming such as places, wedding, tombstones, etc. This character is however gradually ignored by people. Thus, it is extremely important to preserve this near loss heritage culture. In this paper, as a step toward preserving and converting visual information into text, we develop Aksara Jawa text detection system in scene images employing deep convolutional neural network to localize the occurrence of Aksara Jawa text. This method mainly differs from the existing Aksara Jawa text works that employ manually hand-crafted features and explicitly learn a classifier. The features and classifier of this method are jointly learned from which the back-propagation technique is employed to obtain parameters simultaneously. A text confidence map is then produced followed by bounding boxes formation which is estimated and formed to indicate the occurrence of text lines. Experiments show encouraging result for the benefit of text analysis on Aksara Jawa.","doi":"10.1109/KCIC.2017.8228567","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2017 International Electronics Symposium on Knowledge Creation and Intelligent Computing (IES-KCIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KCIC.2017.8228567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228443","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Electronics Symposium on Knowledge Creation and Intelligent Computing (IES-KCIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170163/8228443/08228567.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aksara jawa text detection in scene images using convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228567/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Aksara jawa text detection in scene images using convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228567/","accessionNumber":"17450152","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aksara jawa text detection in scene images using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"14MuhammadLabiybAfakh77821570384614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07163S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170163","isNumber":"8228443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170163","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8228443","articleId":"8228567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8228570,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Fuad Rachmadi","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, Indonesia","Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Reza Fuad","lastName":"Rachmadi","id":"37086269583"},{"name":"Keiichi Uchimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichi","lastName":"Uchimura","id":"37268906200"},{"name":"Gou Koutaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Gou","lastName":"Koutaki","id":"37846212800"},{"name":"Kohichi Ogata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST), Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohichi","lastName":"Ogata","id":"38490751800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0716-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0717-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228570","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228570","abstract":"The demand of High Definition Maps (HD-Maps) has been increasing, especially for autonomous vehicle application.

Satellite imagery or aerial imagery is beneficial because it can widely capture the condition of the surface ground and provides a massive amount of information in a piece of satellite imagery. Since obtaining satellite imagery or aerial imagery is getting more ease in recent years, landslide detection and flood detection is highly in demand. In this paper, we propose automatic natural disaster detection particularly for landslide and flood detection by implementing convolutional neural network (CNN) in extracting the feature of disaster more effectively. CNN is robust to shadow, able to obtain the characteristic of disaster adequately and most importantly able to overcome misdetection or misjudgment by operators, which will affect the effectiveness of disaster relief. The neural network consists of 2 phases: training phase and testing phase. We created training data patches of pre-disaster and post-disaster by clipping and resizing aerial imagery obtained from Google Earth Aerial Imagery. We are currently focusing on two countries which are Japan and Thailand. Training dataset for both landslide and flood consist of 50000 patches. All patches are trained in CNN to extract region where changes occurred or known as disaster region occurred without delay. We obtained accuracy of our system in around 80%-90% of both disaster detections. Based on the promising results, the proposed method may assist in our understanding of the role of deep learning in disaster detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228593/","accessionNumber":"17450166","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228593/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Disaster detection from aerial imagery with convolutional neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disaster detection from aerial imagery with convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"40SitiNorKhuzaimahBintiAmit2392451570392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090171S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170163","isNumber":"8228443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170163","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8228443","articleId":"8228593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8228622,"authors":[{"name":"Huacheng Zeng","affiliation":["University of Louisville"],"firstName":"Huacheng","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38468509900"},{"name":"Chen Cao","affiliation":["University of Louisville"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085365050"},{"name":"Hongxiang Li","affiliation":["University of Louisville"],"firstName":"Hongxiang","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Qiben Yan","affiliation":["University of Nebraska-Lincoln"],"firstName":"Qiben","lastName":"Yan","id":"38235570100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0683-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0682-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0684-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228622","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Wireless fidelity","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming","MIMO communication","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["JrRx","holistic anti-jamming scheme","legitimate communications","WiFi network","jamming signals","wireless MIMO networks","broadband radio jamming attacks","blind jamming mitigation algorithm","multiple unknown radio jammers","BJM algorithm","signal recovery","jamming-resistant receiver","jamming-resistant communications","antijamming solution","jamming mitigation algorithms","noise figure 20.0 dB"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a practical anti-jamming solution for wireless MIMO networks to enable their legitimate communications in the presence of multiple high-power and broadband radio jamming attacks, and evaluate the proposed solution using real-world implementations in a WiFi network. We first develop a blind jamming mitigation (BJM) algorithm, which can cancel jamming signals from multiple unknown radio jammers and, at the same time, equalize channel to recover the signals from the legitimate sender. Unlike the existing jamming mitigation algorithms, the BJM algorithm does not need any channel information for jamming mitigation and signal recovery. Based on the BJM algorithm, we develop a jamming-resistant receiver (termed JrRx) and a holistic anti-jamming scheme to salvage legitimate communications in the face of jamming attacks. We have built a prototype of JrRx and evaluated its performance in a WiFi network. Experimental results show that, as long as JrRx has more antennas than the jammers, it can successfully decode the signals from the sender, even if the jamming signals are 20 dB stronger than the signals of interest.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2017.8228622","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170165/8228604/08228622.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2017.8228622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling jamming-resistant communications in wireless MIMO networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228622/","displayDocTitle":"Enabling jamming-resistant communications in wireless MIMO networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450222","htmlLink":"/document/8228622/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling jamming-resistant communications in wireless MIMO networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p91zeng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106528S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228631,"authors":[{"name":"Liyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Liyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085656009"},{"name":"Francesco Restuccia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Restuccia","id":"38246737900"},{"name":"Tommaso Melodia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Melodia","id":"37266571400"},{"name":"Scott M.

To increase the efficacy and stealthiness of such threats, a number of extremely challenging, next-generation cross-layer attacks have been recently unveiled. Although existing research has thoroughly addressed many single-layer attacks, the problem of detecting and mitigating cross-layer attacks still remains unsolved. For this reason, in this paper we propose a novel framework to analyze and address cross-layer attacks in wireless networks. Specifically, our framework consists of a detection and a mitigation component. The attack detection component is based on a Bayesian learning detection scheme that constructs a model of observed evidence to identify stealthy attack activities. The mitigation component comprises a scheme that achieves the desired trade-off between security and performance. We specialize and evaluate the proposed framework by considering a specific cross-layer attack that uses jamming as an auxiliary tool to achieve route manipulation. Simulations and experimental results obtained with a testbed made up by USRP software-defined radios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228631/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450221","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to detect and mitigate cross-layer attacks in wireless networks: Framework and applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to detect and mitigate cross-layer attacks in wireless networks: Framework and applications","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p299zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063129S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8228632,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Garnaev","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Garnaev","id":"37545521500"},{"name":"Wade Trappe","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wade","lastName":"Trappe","id":"37266719100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0683-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0682-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0684-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228632","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Radar","Signal to noise ratio","Communication systems","Interference","Games","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","game theory","jamming","OFDM modulation","radar applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system equilibrium strategy","jamming equilibrium strategy","OFDM","uncertain jamming power","dual communication","communication objectives","dual radar-communication system","jamming attack","unknown total jamming power","equilibrium jamming strategies","Bayesian approach","water-filling form","game-theoretical model"]}],"abstract":"One of the challenges in designing dual communication and radar systems employing multi-carrier waveforms is addressing the separate radar and communication objectives. This challenge becomes more difficult when one considers that such a system would be the target of malicious attacks, especially those involving interference. In this paper, to gain insight into the problem, a game-theoretical model with SNRs as the utilities for radar and communication objectives is developed for an OFDM-based dual radar-communication system facing a jamming attack. We first investigate the scenario with known jamming power. Then, employing a Bayesian approach, we generalize the formulation to unknown total jamming power. The equilibrium jamming strategies are derived in water-filling form for both scenarios. It is shown that the system equilibrium strategy equalizes the rate at which the system's utility is decreased when jamming enters the scenario. The jamming equilibrium strategy is always unique, while the system has multiple equilibria, but these are shown to be equivalent as they return the same payoff.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An OFDM-based dual radar/communication system facing uncertain jamming power","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2017.8228632","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170165/8228604/08228632.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2017.8228632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An OFDM-based dual radar/communication system facing uncertain jamming power","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228632/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450252","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An OFDM-based dual radar/communication system facing uncertain jamming power","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p290garnaev.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066834S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228633,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Du","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Du","id":"37086094317"},{"name":"Qinghua Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, University of Arkansas"],"firstName":"Qinghua","lastName":"Li","id":"37085687600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0683-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0682-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0684-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228633","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Outsourcing","Servers","Cryptography","Privacy","Optimization","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","gradient methods","nonlinear programming","optimisation","outsourcing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure outsourcing","large-scale nonlinear programming","cloud computing","computing resources","large-scale computations","privacy concerns","output privacy","engineering optimization tasks","secure transformation scheme","encrypted nonlinear programming problem","designed outsourcing protocol","security concerns","efficiency outsourcing","efficiency transformation scheme","detailed proofs"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is attracting increasing attention since it enables clients with limited computing resources to perform and complete large-scale computations.

Consequently, an adversary targeting the channel sounding process has the potential to significantly degrade performance. In this paper, we first present and model the Pilot Distortion Attack, a simple but devastating jamming strategy in which the adversary distorts the AP's CSI measurement of even a single client leading to denial-of-service for all clients associated with the AP. We propose MACE as a countermeasure that exploits the AP's large antenna array to detect jamming with zero startup cost and zero additional network overhead. Our key insight is that with many antennas, the AP's variance estimator of client Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) will significantly increase when there are jamming signals present. We build a testbed with a 72-antenna massive MIMO AP and conduct the first experimental study of the Pilot Distortion Attack. Our results show that a single-antenna adversary jamming no more than 1/60 of the time and having no more transmit power than any client can cause over 26% reduction of achievable rate of all clients. Moreover, by setting a single threshold, MACE can achieve 0.97 true positive at 0.01 false positive for various client/adversary locations and for a wide range of SNR (5 ~ 35 dB) and SIR (- 5 ~ 35 dB) with SNR - SIR\u22655 dB.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2017.8228634","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170165/8228604/08228634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2017.8228634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO pilot distortion attack and zero-startup-cost detection: Analysis and experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228634/","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO pilot distortion attack and zero-startup-cost detection: Analysis and experiments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450235","htmlLink":"/document/8228634/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO pilot distortion attack and zero-startup-cost detection: Analysis and experiments","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p73zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077171S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228639,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaonan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaonan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086169191"},{"name":"Qi Jia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085734767"},{"name":"Linke Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Linke","lastName":"Guo","id":"38236725100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0683-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0682-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0684-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228639","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Authentication","Receivers","Data communication","Modulation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSA system","dynamic spectrum access","optimized unauthorized secondary user detection","secure user detection","optimized unauthorized SU detection scheme","secure SU detection scheme","severe interference","spectrum permit","licensed spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Spectrum Access","Unauthorized SU Detection","Security","Accuracy","Efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been envisioned to become the key to solving worldwide spectrum shortage.

Massive MIMO systems often operate in a time division duplexing (TDD) fashion. The BS estimates the channel state information (CSI) at receivers based on their uplink pilot transmissions. Downlink transmission rates are highly dependent on these estimates, as the BS utilizes the CSI to exploit the beamforming gain offered by massive MIMO. However, this CSI estimation phase is vulnerable to malicious attacks. Specifically, an attacker can contaminate the uplink pilot sequences by generating identical pilot signals to those of legitimate users. We formulate a denial of service (DoS) attack in which the attacker aims to minimize the sum-rate of downlink transmissions by contaminating the uplink pilots. We also consider another attack model where the attacker generates jamming signals in both the CSI estimation and data transmission phases by exploiting in-band full-duplex techniques. We study these attacks under two power allocation strategies for downlink transmissions. Our analysis is conducted when the attacker knows or does not know the locations of the BS and users. When the attacker does not have perfect location information, stochastic optimization techniques are utilized to assess the impact of the attack. The formulated problems are solved using interior-point, Lagrangian minimization, and game-theoretic methods. We obtain a closed-form solution for a special case of the problem. Our results indicate that even though the attacker does not have the perfect location information, proposed pilot contamination attacks degrade the throughput of a massive MIMO system by more than 50%, and reduce fairness among users significantly.

It was shown that, over n independent channel uses, O(\u221an) bits can transmitted reliably over a public channel while achieving an arbitrarily low probability of detection (LPD) by other stations. This result is well known as the square-root law and even to achieve this diminishing rate of covert communication, all existing studies utilized some form of secret shared between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, we establish the limits of LPD communication over the MIMO AWGN channel. In particular, using relative entropy as our LPD metric, we study the maximum codebook size for which the transmitter can guarantee reliability and LPD conditions are met. We first show that, the optimal codebook generating input distribution under \u03b4-PD constraint is the zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Then, assuming channel state information (CSI) on only the main channel at the transmitter, we derive the optimal input covariance matrix, hence, establishing scaling laws of the codebbok size. We evaluate the codebook scaling rates in the limiting regimes for the number of channel uses (asymptotic block length) and the number of antennas (massive MIMO). We show that, in the asymptotic block-length regime, square-root law still holds for the MIMO AWGN. Meanwhile, in massive MIMO limit, the codebook size, while it scales linearly with \u221an, it scales exponentially with the number of transmitting antennas. The practical implication of our result is that MIMO has the potential to provide a substantial increase in the file sizes that can be covertly communicated subject to a reasonably low delay.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2017.8228657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2017.8228657","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170165/8228604/08228657.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental limits of covert communication over MIMO AWGN channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental limits of covert communication over MIMO AWGN channel","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228657/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450213","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228657/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental limits of covert communication over MIMO AWGN channel","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p64abdelaziz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064424S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8228658,"authors":[{"name":"Seth Andrews","affiliation":["Virginia Tech, Arlington, VA"],"firstName":"Seth","lastName":"Andrews","id":"37086328111"},{"name":"Ryan M.

Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been proposed to allow cognitive radio networks to use existing spectrum more efficiently. It will allow secondary users to transmit on already allocated spectrum on a non-interference basis. Cognitive radios are able to change bandwidth and other transmission characteristics to take greater advantage of this spectrum. It is necessary to identify all devices on the network in order to enforce spectrum access rules. Manufacturing variation cause minute differences in signals from supposedly identical devices. Physical layer identification (also called device fingerprinting) techniques allow identification of devices based on small but unique variation due to these imperfections. Fingerprinting is very sensitive to any changes in the signal capture setup or the device's environment. The changes in bandwidth that would occur in a DSA system cause device fingerprinting to fail. In this paper we extend current device identification methods to include identification of devices with changing bandwidth. Experimental results are demonstrated on a collection of over 50 transmitters, with a significant improvement over current methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17450219","htmlLink":"/document/8228658/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards physical layer identification of cognitive radio devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards physical layer identification of cognitive radio devices","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p353andrews.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056337S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8228665,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Cheng","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Commun., University of Elec.

techniques based on channel coding with feedback are proposed in this paper to enhance the security of wireless communications systems at the physical layer. Reliable and secure transmission over an additive noise Gaussian wiretap channel is investigated using Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) and Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) channel codes. A hybrid automatic repeat-request (HARQ) protocol is used to allow for the retransmission of coded packets requested by the intended receiver (Bob). It is assumed that an eavesdropper (Eve) has access to all forward and feedback transmitted packets. To limit the information leakage to Eve, retransmitted packets are subdivided into smaller granular subpackets. Retransmissions are stopped as soon as the decoding process at the legitimate (Bob) receiver converges. For the hard decision decoded BCH codes, a framework to compute the frame error probability with granular HARQ is proposed. For LDPC codes, the HARQ retransmission requests are based on received symbols likelihood computations: the legitimate recipient request for the retransmission of the set of bits that are more likely to help for successful LDPC decoding. The performances of the proposed techniques are assessed for nul and negative security gap (SG) values, that is when the eavesdropper's channel benefits from equal or better channel conditions than the legitimate channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228670/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17450182","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228670/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Physical layer security using BCH and LDPC codes with adaptive granular HARQ","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical layer security using BCH and LDPC codes with adaptive granular HARQ","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p565hajtaieb.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06259S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8228681,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Tahmasbi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Tahmasbi","id":"37085472901"},{"name":"Matthieu R.

It is used to calculate the Area Control Error (ACE) based on frequency and tie-line power flow between balancing areas, and then adjust power generation to maintain the power system frequency in an acceptable range. However, attackers might inject malicious frequency or tie-line power flow measurements to mislead AGC to do false generation correction which will harm the power grid operation. Such attacks are hard to be detected since they do not violate physical power system models. In this work, we propose algorithms based on Neural Network and Fourier Transform to detect data forgery attacks in AGC. Different from the few previous work that rely on accurate load prediction to detect data forgery, our solution only uses the ACE data already available in existing AGC systems. In particular, our solution learns the normal patterns of ACE time series and detects abnormal patterns caused by artificial attacks. Evaluations on the real ACE dataset show that our methods have high detection accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2017.8228705","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170165/8228604/08228705.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"404","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2017.8228705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning-based data forgery detection in automatic generation control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning-based data forgery detection in automatic generation control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228705/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450264","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228705/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning-based data forgery detection in automatic generation control","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p400zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051011S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8228709,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Abubaker","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Abubaker","id":"37086321044"},{"name":"Leonard Dervishi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"Dervishi","id":"37086324675"},{"name":"Erman Ayday","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erman","lastName":"Ayday","id":"37698056500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0683-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0682-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0684-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228709","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":577},"abstract":"As an extension of cloud computing, fog computing is proving itself more and more potentially useful nowadays. Fog computing is introduced to overcome the shortcomings of cloud computing paradigm in handling the massive amount of traffic caused by the enormous number of Internet of Things devices being increasingly connected to the Internet on daily basis. Despite its advantages, fog architecture introduces new security and privacy threats that need to be studied and solved as soon as possible. In this work, we explore two privacy issues posed by the fog computing architecture and we define privacy challenges according to them. The first challenge is related to the fog's design purposes of reducing the latency and improving the bandwidth, where the existing privacy-preserving methods violate these design purposed. The other challenge is related to the proximity of fog nodes to the end-users or IoT devices. We discuss the importance of addressing these challenges by putting them in the context of real-life scenarios. Finally, we propose a privacy-preserving fog computing paradigm that solves these challenges and we assess the security and efficiency of our solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170165/8228604/08228709.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"509","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2017.8228709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2017.8228709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving fog computing paradigm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Edge computing","Privacy","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Security","Intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","security of data","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fog nodes","privacy-preserving fog computing paradigm","cloud computing","privacy threats","fog computing architecture","security assessment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Privacy in Fog","IoT","Fog Computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving fog computing paradigm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8228709/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450197","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-preserving fog computing paradigm","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p502abubaker.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054922S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170165","isNumber":"8228604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170165","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8228604","articleId":"8228709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228721,"authors":[{"name":"Tung Nguyen","affiliation":["Wireless Network Development Division, NEC Corporation, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tung","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086185024"},{"name":"Masashi Hirabe","affiliation":["Wireless Network Development Division, NEC Corporation, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masashi","lastName":"Hirabe","id":"37086001369"},{"name":"Ryuji Zenkyu","affiliation":["Wireless Network Development Division, NEC Corporation, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuji","lastName":"Zenkyu","id":"37086182654"},{"name":"Masaya Uchida","affiliation":["Wireless Network Development Division, NEC Corporation, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaya","lastName":"Uchida","id":"37086262966"},{"name":"Eisaku Sasaki","affiliation":["Wireless Network Development Division, NEC Corporation, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Eisaku","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"38492854500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0464-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228721","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular momentum","multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio links","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric lens","uniform circular array","high capacity radio link","Orbital Angular Momentum mode-multiplexing","Software Defined Radio based system","signal processing","16-QAM data streams","OAM mode-multiplexing","size 0.5 m","frequency 5.1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orbital Angular Momentum","mode multiplexing","lens antenna","Uniform Circular Array","Spectral Efficiency"]}],"abstract":"The feasibility of a high capacity radio link employing Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) mode-multiplexing is discussed in this paper.

The proposed method utilizes the framework of Compressive Sensing and the sparse signal is constructed via difference incentives of reference array without failures and array under test with failure elements. Fourier transform submatrix is used to constitute measurement matrix and a random undersampling strategy is implemented on the far field radiation patterns of reference array and array under test to acquire measurement data. Three ISTA, including Parallel Coordinate Decent (PCD) Algorithm, Separable Surrogate Functional (SSF) Algorithm, Iterative Reweighted Least Square (IRLS) Algorithm are then applied to reconstruct the sparse signal. Several simulation experiments are carried out and the results indicate that proposed method not only locates the positions of failure elements precisely, but also identifies their failure types using far less measurement points compared with traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISANP.2017.8228799","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170167/8228714/08228799.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISANP.2017.8228799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid diagnosis method for defective array elements based on compressive sensing and Iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228799/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid diagnosis method for defective array elements based on compressive sensing and Iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450525","htmlLink":"/document/8228799/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid diagnosis method for defective array elements based on compressive sensing and Iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1165liweihit3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035999S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170167","isNumber":"8228714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170167","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228714","articleId":"8228799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228816,"authors":[{"name":"Jihoon Bang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jihoon","lastName":"Bang","id":"37086273495"},{"name":"Youngtaek Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Youngtaek","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085433595"},{"name":"Jaehoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0464-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228816","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1809},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","5G mobile communication","Slot antennas","Mobile antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna phased arrays","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile handset","slot antenna elements","metal-body","5G mobile communication","mm-wave phased array antenna","whole-metal-covered 5G mobile phone applications","S-parameter characteristics","mutual-coupling","hemispherical beam coverage","frequency 27.1 GHz to 28.6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fifth generation (5G)","mm-wave","phased-array","beam-steering","handset antennas","slot antenna"]}],"abstract":"A novel mm-wave phased array antenna for whole metal covered 5G mobile handset is proposed.

The capacity gains of aperiodic over uniform array antenna configurations are presented, which at some distances can be a factor 2.5.","doi":"10.1109/ISANP.2017.8228884","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170167/8228714/08228884.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISANP.2017.8228884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228714","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point-to-point 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO performance gains with aperiodic sparse arrays in pure LOS channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8228884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Point-to-point 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO performance gains with aperiodic sparse arrays in pure LOS channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8228884/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450618","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8228884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point-to-point 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO performance gains with aperiodic sparse arrays in pure LOS channels","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1294AAGChalmers1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039525S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170167","isNumber":"8228714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170167","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228714","articleId":"8228884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8228893,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Ju Huang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Ju","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086232515"},{"name":"Hsi-Tseng Chou","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsi-Tseng","lastName":"Chou","id":"37279738600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0465-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0464-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0466-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8228893","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Wires","Genetic algorithms","Radio frequency","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","cost reduction","electromagnetic interference","genetic algorithms","interference suppression","microcontrollers","phase shifters","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical MCU architecture","control wires","electromagnetic interferences","antenna radiation","Genetic algorithm","phased antenna array","dynamic phase shifter controls","hierarchical microcontrol unit architecture","radiation beamforming","RF device control","cost reduction","binary codes","phase discrepancy reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming Algorithm","Phased array of antennas","Subarray decomposition","Hierarchical control architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hierarchical MCU (micro-control unit) architecture to reduce the number of wires required to control the RF devices of large phased array of antennas.

Maximum realized gains of 2.83 dB (in the lower band) and 3.28 dB (in the upper band) are achieved.

However, the MIMO performance is analyzed by envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of the UWB MIMO antenna.","doi":"10.1109/ISANP.2017.8229048","publicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170167/8228714/08229048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISANP.2017.8229048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8228714","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact printed UWB MIMO antenna with pattern diversity characteristic for portable devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compact printed UWB MIMO antenna with pattern diversity characteristic for portable devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 2 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229048/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-2 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17450340","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229048/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact printed UWB MIMO antenna with pattern diversity characteristic for portable devices","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1522iitd20171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035517S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2017-Nov. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170167","isNumber":"8228714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170167","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8228714","articleId":"8229048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229119,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Yao","affiliation":["Translational Neuromodeling Unit, University of Zurich & ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Yao","id":"37089106454"},{"name":"Guanghao Sun","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Guanghao","lastName":"Sun","id":"38238880600"},{"name":"Tetsuo Kirimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics and Engineering, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Kirimoto","id":"37270130900"},{"name":"Takemi Matsui","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takemi","lastName":"Matsui","id":"37671488700"},{"name":"Michael Schiek","affiliation":["ZEA-2 - Electronic Systems, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, J\u00fclich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schiek","id":"37402559900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0882-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0883-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229119","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Delays","Mathematical model","Kalman filters","Nonlinear filters","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","Kalman filters","medical signal processing","nonlinear filters","state estimation","state-space methods","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online state space filtering","neural network-augmented Kalman filter","Gaussian state space models","nonlinear time series analysis","nonlinear filters","linear filters","state space filter","delay embedding principle","online estimation","nonlinear delay space filter","state estimation problem","extended Kalman filter","feed-forward neural network","Kalman filter state","artificial biomedical time series"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kalman filter","artificial neural network","state space filtering","delay embedding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229119","abstract":"Since its inception, the Kalman filter, which represents the optimal estimator for linear, Gaussian state space models, has been adopted for a wide array of practical applications due to its efficient, recursive formulation. At the same time, the field of nonlinear time series analysis has produced powerful methods for filtering time series with deterministic dynamics. These nonlinear filters differ significantly from linear filters, because they transform the time series via delay embedding and exploiting geometric features in delay space. However, they are not capable of operating recursively like the Kalman filter. In this paper, we propose a state space filter based on the delay embedding principle, but capable of online estimation. This is achieved by formulating the nonlinear delay space filter as a state estimation problem, which can be solved using the extended Kalman filter. In order for this reformulation to work, it is necessary to approximate the dynamics of the time series. For this purpose, we use a feed-forward neural network. By embedding the neural network weights in the Kalman filter state, we are able to simultaneously estimate the hidden dynamics of the time series and perform online state space filtering. We present preliminary performance estimates of our online state space filtering approach obtained from tests with artificial biomedical time series.","doi":"10.1109/BMEiCON.2017.8229119","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187746/8229097/08229119.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 10th Biomedical Engineering International Conference (BMEiCON)","publicationTitle":"2017 10th Biomedical Engineering International Conference (BMEiCON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEiCON.2017.8229119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online state space filtering of biosignals using neural network-augmented Kalman filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2017-Sept. 2 2017","displayDocTitle":"Online state space filtering of biosignals using neural network-augmented Kalman filter","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17452000","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229119/","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online state space filtering of biosignals using neural network-augmented Kalman filter","confLoc":"Hokkaido, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570370038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043191S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2017-Sept. 2 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187746","isNumber":"8229097","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187746","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229097","articleId":"8229119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8229134,"authors":[{"name":"Kuntinan Plathong","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kuntinan","lastName":"Plathong","id":"37086268921"},{"name":"Boonprasert Surakratanasakul","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Boonprasert","lastName":"Surakratanasakul","id":"38246745600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0882-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0881-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-0883-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229134","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Internet of Things","Protocols","Monitoring","Cloud computing","XML","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood","cloud computing","health care","medical information systems","patient monitoring","Web services","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patient treatment","Internet of Things","aging society support","medical data transfer","real-time healthcare monitoring support","JSON language","web service","XML language","Health Level 7 standard","hospitals","public health","medical device","cloud computing","health level 7 protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time healthcare monitoring system","Internet of Things","Health Level 7","Cloud computing","XML"]}],"abstract":"Thailand will fully enter aging society in 2025 has a major impact on the rise of patients in each country.

Simulation result demonstrates that the proposed procedure is more computationally efficient than the conventionally-implemented construction of oblique projectors without the degradation of bit-error-rate (BER) performance in the DS/CDMA system.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229252","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187602/8229179/08229252.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous DS/CDMA of recursive oblique projectors using the Gram-Schmidt process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229252/","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous DS/CDMA of recursive oblique projectors using the Gram-Schmidt process","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451946","htmlLink":"/document/8229252/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous DS/CDMA of recursive oblique projectors using the Gram-Schmidt process","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570368490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064192S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187602","isNumber":"8229179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187602","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8229179","articleId":"8229252","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229253,"authors":[{"name":"Soumya Kanti Datta","affiliation":["EURECOM, France"],"firstName":"Soumya Kanti","lastName":"Datta","id":"38236898300"},{"name":"Christian Bonnet","affiliation":["EURECOM, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Bonnet","id":"37268481800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4046-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229253","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":991},"abstract":"The current IoT ecosystem is Cloud centric which can not handle a diverse set of IoT applications and services, especially those demanding real time response.

However, existing VLC systems require high-speed camera to achieve high data rate. To achieve VLC with sufficient data rate using commercial devices (e.g., smartphones), VLC using low-speed image sensor and MEMS mirror is proposed. In proposed technique, the transmitter emits modulated light pulses using an LED, and the receiver obtains the message using MEMS mirror and image sensor. Specifically, incoming light of fast blinking (time-domain signal) is scanned and converted to dotted and dashed lines (space-domain signal) by MEMS mirror, and image sensor can capture multiple bits per frame efficiently. The performance of the system was evaluated in experiments. The obtained results suggest that the proposed VLC system using low-speed image sensor and MEMS mirror could achieve data rate of 25 bps (frame rate of image sensor: 5 fps) with bit-error rate of 0 when signal-to-noise ratio was more than 5 dB.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229354","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187602/8229179/08229354.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of efficient and compact visible light communication using low-speed image sensor and MEMS mirror","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229354/","displayDocTitle":"Design of efficient and compact visible light communication using low-speed image sensor and MEMS mirror","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451905","htmlLink":"/document/8229354/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of efficient and compact visible light communication using low-speed image sensor and MEMS mirror","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570372082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037371S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187602","isNumber":"8229179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187602","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8229179","articleId":"8229354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229377,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Chih Jimmy Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Chih Jimmy","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086296202"},{"name":"Po-Chen Chien","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Chen","lastName":"Chien","id":"37086296033"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4046-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229377","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Feature extraction","Frequency-domain analysis","Resonant frequency","Time-domain analysis","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electrocardiography","medical signal processing","neural nets","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast ECG diagnosis","compressive neural network","electrocardiogram diagnosis","clinical approach","cardiac disease","accurate ECG diagnosis","nonlinear problem","analyzes ECG signal","time domain","ECG analyzing","long computing time","complex preprocessing","time-domain analysis","frequency domain analysis","ECG diagnosis time","conventional ECG wavelet analysis","average accuracy loss","frequency domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG","Wavelet Transform","Neural Network","Frequency","Compressive"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229377","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187602/8229179/08229377.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast ECG diagnosis using frequency-based compressive neural network","abstract":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis is a widely-used clinical approach because it has been proven as an efficient way to diagnose cardiac disease. However, to get an accurate ECG diagnosis is a challenging task because it is a nonlinear problem. Therefore, many Neural Network (NN)-based ECG analysis approaches were proposed to analyzes ECG signal in time domain in recent years which can improve the ability of ECG analyzing. However, these methods suffer from long computing time because of complex preprocessing. To solve this problem, we propose a method that analyze ECG signal in frequency domain. Different from the time-domain analysis, frequency domain analysis requires less preprocessing, fewer parameters, and less complexity of analysis. The experimental result shows that the proposed method save 80% of ECG diagnosis time compared with the conventional ECG wavelet analysis with only 5% average accuracy loss.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229377/","accessionNumber":"17434229","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8229377/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A fast ECG diagnosis using frequency-based compressive neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast ECG diagnosis using frequency-based compressive neural network","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570372431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044424S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187602","isNumber":"8229179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187602","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229179","articleId":"8229377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229395,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Chou Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng-Chou","lastName":"Chang","id":"38183724500"},{"name":"Ze-Gang Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ze-Gang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37086171812"},{"name":"Jyun-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jyun-Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086295121"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4046-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229395","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":700},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware accelerator for boosting convolution computation in image classification applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187602/8229179/08229395.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229179","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229395","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Hardware","Rockets","Kernel","Image classification","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image classification","matrix multiplication","neural nets","reduced instruction set computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution hardware accelerator","image classification applications","CNN","convolution calculation","total processing work","efficient matrix multiplication","convolution computation boosting","convolutional neural network","matrix multiplication","RISC-V Rocket processor","CHA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","image classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229395","abstract":"In a convolutional neural network (CNN), convolution calculation can account for about 90% of the total processing work.

Analyzing massive amount of data can be done by accessing and connecting various devices with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). However, it is not enough to have an Internet support and self-updating readings from the sensors but also to have a self-sustainable agricultural production with the use of analytics for the data to be useful. This study developed a smart hydroponics system that is used in automating the growing process of the crops using exact inference in Bayesian Network (BN). Sensors and actuators are installed in order to monitor and control the physical events such as light intensity, pH, electrical conductivity, water temperature, and relative humidity. The sensor values gathered were used to build the Bayesian Network in order to infer the optimum value for each parameter. A web interface is developed wherein the user can monitor and control the farm remotely via the Internet. Results have shown that the fluctuations in terms of the sensor values were minimized in the automatic control using BN as compared to the manual control. The yielded crop on the automatic control was 66.67% higher than the manual control which implies that the use of exact inference in BN aids in producing high-quality crops. In the future, the system can use higher data analytics and longer data gathering to improve the accuracy of inference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2017.8229470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229179","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 6th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8187602/8229179/08229470.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A smart hydroponics farming system using exact inference in Bayesian network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229470/","displayDocTitle":"A smart hydroponics farming system using exact inference in Bayesian network","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17501872","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smart hydroponics farming system using exact inference in Bayesian network","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"1570372866.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058327S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8187602","isNumber":"8229179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8187602","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8229179","articleId":"8229470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229472,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Hsien Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Chin-Hsien","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276427800"},{"name":"Ting-Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of and Computer Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Ting-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086314691"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4045-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4046-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229472","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229472","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Recycling","Data structures","Embedded systems","Aerospace electronics","Memory management","Cats"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","embedded systems","flash memories","NAND circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["garbage collection mechanism","NAND-based storage systems","demand-based caching method","flash-memory embedded systems","NAND flash memory","erase-before-write characteristic","RAM-limited embedded systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND Flash Memory","Garbage Collection","Embedded Systems"]}],"abstract":"NAND flash memory has been used for the data storage of mobile devices, Laptops, and various embedded systems, but requires a garbage collection mechanism due to its erase-before-write characteristic.

Those authors have applied techniques as digital images processing and machine learning, combined with different sizes of datasets and color spaces such as: RGB, HSI and Lab. More recently, deep learning has been used, working with grayscale, though. We present a method for automatic classification of light field smear microscopy patches using RGB, R-G and grayscale patches versions as inputs of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model for identifying MT. A dataset of negative and positive patches was created for training three CNN Models applying regularization techniques, like: dataset normalization, data augmentation and dropout. The best result in the patch classification test was reached using R-G input version and a three convolutional layers Model with regularization, getting an Area under ROC Curve of 99%.","doi":"10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229512","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170169/8229498/08229512.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","publicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic classification of light field smear microscopy patches using Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying mycobacterium tuberculosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of light field smear microscopy patches using Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying mycobacterium tuberculosis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17434139","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229512/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of light field smear microscopy patches using Convolutional Neural Networks for identifying mycobacterium tuberculosis","confLoc":"Pucon, Chile","sourcePdf":"014IEEECHILECON2017paper185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048518S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170169","isNumber":"8229498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170169","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8229498","articleId":"8229512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229517,"authors":[{"name":"Hector Kaschel","affiliation":["Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago de Chile, CL"],"firstName":"Hector","lastName":"Kaschel"},{"name":"Karel Toledo","affiliation":["Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago de Chile, CL"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Toledo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3123-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3122-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3124-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229517","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Cognitive radio","Irrigation","Sensors","Radio spectrum management","Silicon compounds","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","radio spectrum management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient spectrum management","cognitive radio sensor networks","spectrum underutilization problem","Wireless Sensor Networks","noncooperative sensing techniques","optimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)","Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN)","energy efficiency","spectrum management"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient spectrum management in cognitive radio sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229498","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170169/8229498/08229517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229517","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229517","abstract":"Cognitive Radio has been proposed as a solution to the spectrum underutilization problem in Wireless Sensor Networks.

The Ecuadorian Armed Forces are trying to equip their soldiers with IoT Technology to monitor and visualize in real time the state of health during combat missions. However, the implementation and research, at least in Ecuador; has been very complex due to two problems: (1) organization in the design and the integration of the components and applications when participate several researchers and engineers of multiple disciplines (e.g, control, software) and (2) the complex implementation due to the technological fragmentation between the military contexts (e.g., air force, army and navy). We propose an approach to the solution to the implementation of real-time military health monitoring in combat missions, using the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm and the research model proposed by Takeuchi & Nonaka. We were able to obtain a meta-model delineated in the 4 domains of the IoT Technology embedded within the 4 contexts of a product line process.

This paper presents the application of an artificial neural network to improve position estimates from inertial measurement in a mobile robot navigating in an indoor environment.","doi":"10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229655","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170169/8229498/08229655.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network regularization of an inertial odometry estimation for position control of a mobile robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Acceleration","Estimation","Training","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","inertial systems","mobile robots","neural nets","path planning","position control","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network regularization","inertial odometry estimation","position control","autonomous mobile robots","reasonable precision","sensor fusion","good enough estimation","artificial neural network","position estimates","inertial measurement","mobile robot navigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","inertial measurement units","mobile robots","position control","autonomous robots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Neural network regularization of an inertial odometry estimation for position control of a mobile robot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8229655/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17451010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network regularization of an inertial odometry estimation for position control of a mobile robot","confLoc":"Pucon, Chile","sourcePdf":"157IEEECHILECON2017paper090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070836S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170169","isNumber":"8229498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170169","xplore-issue":"8229498","articleId":"8229655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229656,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel R.

The estimation involves previewing the input impedances and power loss for each coupling arrangement on every position pair at the feeder, calculated for frequencies between 9 kHz to 10 MHz. When we deal with PLC in primary distribution feeders, the time changes on the stochastic parameters of the channel model are less important than in secondary distribution, making structural modeling a good choice. The presented algorithm is based on the existing theory of multiconductor transmission lines (MTL) and nodal analysis. Models from literature for distribution transformers, high frequency ground losses, noise on overhead feeders and for coupling units are considered. All the cited models and theories are integrated in an algorithm that is capable of predicting the behavior of the PLC signals in a complete feeder. The parameters of the lines, connecting topologies, wires and loads are read from tables generated by the actual data base systems currently adopted by energy suppliers. The results can be applied to predict the optimized allocation of the power spectrum with the minimum necessary power use, the possible achieved capacity and consequent technical viability. Also, to reduce the cost of installed network, the number and the cost of transceivers and repeaters and no less important, preventing possible interferences with other systems. Finally, we present the results for a real overhead feeder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line matrix methods","Transmitters","Power transmission lines","Receivers","Conductors","Impedance","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","multiconductor transmission lines","power overhead lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power loss","coupling arrangement","position pair","primary distribution feeders","stochastic parameters","channel model","secondary distribution","structural modeling","power line communication","multiconductor transmission lines","MTL","PLC","overall capacity forecasting","input impedances","complete distribution feeder","primary distribution overhead lines","capacity estimation algorithm","technical viability","possible achieved capacity","minimum necessary power use","power spectrum","actual data base systems","complete feeder","coupling units","overhead feeder","high frequency ground losses","distribution transformers","nodal analysis","frequency 9.0 kHz to 10.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power line communication","coupler PLC","channel model","narrowband PLC","broadband PLC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229656","doi":"10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229656","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 CHILEAN Conference on Electrical, Electronics Engineering, Information and Communication Technologies (CHILECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170169/8229498/08229656.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHILECON.2017.8229656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229656/","displayDocTitle":"Channel model with capacity estimation algorithm on primary distribution overhead lines for broadband PLC","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17450983","htmlLink":"/document/8229656/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel model with capacity estimation algorithm on primary distribution overhead lines for broadband PLC","confLoc":"Pucon, Chile","sourcePdf":"158IEEECHILECON2017paper106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068021S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170169","isNumber":"8229498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170169","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229498","articleId":"8229656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229700,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With all this, the idea is to reduce the computational cost while eliminating the necessity of weighting factors and improving the performance of the full system.

Also the performance of different window functions has been compared based on the area under the curve (AUC).","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229816.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of window functions for exon prediction in DNA sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","DNA","Proteins","Encoding","Automation","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","discrete Fourier transforms","DNA","genetics","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","exon prediction","DNA sequences","DFT","protein coding region detection","discrete Fourier transform","window functions","area under the curve","AUC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Short-time discrete Fourier transform (ST-DFT)","3-baseperiodicity","Fourier spectral analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of window functions for exon prediction in DNA sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8229816/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17449045","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of window functions for exon prediction in DNA sequences","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"153631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040869S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229834,"authors":[{"name":"Piyush Kumar Mudgal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Piyush Kumar","lastName":"Mudgal","id":"37086310721"},{"name":"Rajesh Purohit","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Purohit","id":"37719102200"},{"name":"Rajesh Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086311315"},{"name":"Mahendra Kumar Jangir","affiliation":["School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mahendra Kumar","lastName":"Jangir","id":"37086313152"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229834","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Ciphers","Sociology","Statistics","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","cryptanalysis","computer science","security measurement","cryptographic algorithm","Brute-force method","meta heuristic applications","mono-alphabetic substitution cipher technique","selection genetic operators","crossover genetic operator","mutation genetic operator","selection-random with elitism","roulette wheel","tournament options"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Ciphers","Encryption","Roulette wheel selection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229834","abstract":"Today, security is a vital concern in computer science, cryptography is used vastly for implementation of the same. Cryptanalysis is a process in which the security is attempted to breach and the complexity of this process is considered as security measurement. As cryptographic algorithm is open to all, the whole strength lies in the complexity of the key i.e. efforts to crack the key. Mostly the strength of the key is shown through its length, eventually the number of communication (Brute-force method). Genetic algorithms are considered to be a tool for meta heuristic applications. In this work an attempt is made to carry out cryptanalysis, through genetic algorithms. In this, mono-alphabetic substitution cipher technique is considered. The experiment is carried out for four key samples, and attempt to break with variations in genetic operators i.e. selection, crossover and mutation. Regarding variations, for selection-random with elitism, roulette wheel and tournament options are used, for crossover - 1-point, 2-point and Uniform options are used, with interchanging mutation.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229834","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229834.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"405","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of genetic algorithm in cryptanalysis of mono-alphabetic substitution cipher","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic algorithm in cryptanalysis of mono-alphabetic substitution cipher","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17449066","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229834/","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic algorithm in cryptanalysis of mono-alphabetic substitution cipher","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"215620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065581S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229836,"authors":[{"name":"Subama Shakya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Lalitpur, Nepal"],"firstName":"Subama","lastName":"Shakya","id":"38253171800"},{"name":"Sandeep Sigdel","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Tribhuvan University, Lalitpur, Nepal"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Sigdel","id":"37086303837"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229836","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Classification algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Anomaly detection","Computational modeling","Automation","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","mean square error methods","pattern classification","security of data","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection algorithm","anomaly identification","abnormality revelation calculation","anomaly recognition calculations","false alert rate","high resource usage","anomaly detection systems","weighted hybrid model","support vector machine","anomaly discovery","accuracy based weight values","hybrid algorithm","Naive Bayes classifiers","weight elements","k-fold cross validation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","support vector machine","naive bayes","cross validation","error","weight values","hybrid algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection involves way towards finding the example in the information that violates ordinary conduct. The choice of anomaly detection algorithm can to a great extent affect the undertaking of anomaly identification. The decision of abnormality revelation calculation can influence complexity and correctness of the process. The choice of anomaly recognition calculations may increase the occurrence of false alert rate, high resource usage, and may even lead to security vulnerabilities. In addition, one anomaly detection procedure can beat the other in same dataset. In this way, many anomaly detection systems can be used to merge the prediction from multiple system in order to improve the generalizability over a single estimator. In this research work, we show a weighted hybrid model utilizing Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes for anomaly discovery, k-fold cross validation to figure the error related with corresponding model and accuracy based weight values to be used with the candidate model. The hybrid algorithm has been executed to join the result of expectation of SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers utilizing weight elements. The weights elements have been computed utilizing root mean square error of forecast as error metric. The classifier with high accuracy has been given higher weight and classifier with the lower precision has been given lower weight. The objective is to improve the performance of hybrid model than that of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to develop a hybrid algorithm based on support vector machine and Naive Bayes for anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229836","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229836.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"An approach to develop a hybrid algorithm based on support vector machine and Naive Bayes for anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8229836/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17449207","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to develop a hybrid algorithm based on support vector machine and Naive Bayes for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"2114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073166S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229841,"authors":[{"name":"Akanksha Rai Sharma","affiliation":["Information's Technology Dept., Amity School of Engineering and Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Akanksha Rai","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086291523"},{"name":"Pranav Kaushik","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Dept., Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Techology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Pranav","lastName":"Kaushik","id":"37086292051"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229841","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2625},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Natural language processing","Neural networks","Machine learning","Information retrieval","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","public domain software","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","natural language processing","Deep learning","language models","statistical models","Convolutional Neural Networking","open source software TensorFlow","gaming","reward-driven algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Natural Language Processing","Information Extraction","Statistical models","Neural Networks","Deep Learning","TensorFlow","Reinforcement Learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229841","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229841.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Literature survey of statistical, deep and reinforcement learning in natural language processing","abstract":"This paper underlines the necessity to incorporate Deep learning and Neural networking in language models under scrutiny for Natural Language Processing.

There have been several approaches to handwriting recognition but the recognition of handwritten characters using deep learning has been a hot topic of research in the past five years. This paper proposes a method of converting handwritten text into speech at real time using the concept of deep neural networks. Moreover the pre-processing is improved by using an enhanced edge detection method for thinning the boundaries of the segmented characters. The recognized text is converted into speech. This system provides the benefit of reducing the hectic task of manually going through the handwritten documents in places such as banks and post offices. It can have various applications such as the audio based checking of exam sheets of students in schools and colleges preventing the task of recognizing the handwritten characters, would be beneficial for the blind, for the people who are illiterate and do not know reading but know a specific language. It proposes to reduce the human effort in understanding one's handwriting and easily they can listen to the speech converted. It can be beneficial for the students as well as they can simple listen to their notes and learn better.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Particle swarm optimization","Noise measurement","Detectors","Sociology","Statistics","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","edge detection","handwritten character recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","optical character recognition","particle swarm optimisation","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization technique","handwriting recognition","handwritten characters","deep learning","deep neural networks","segmented characters","recognized text","hectic task","handwritten documents","edge detection method","handwritten text into speech"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","deep learning","handwriting to speech conversion","real time OCR"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229843","startPage":"363","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229843.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge detection using particle swarm optimization technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Edge detection using particle swarm optimization technique","accessionNumber":"17449234","publicationDate":"May 2017","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229843/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge detection using particle swarm optimization technique","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"28255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153688S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229875,"authors":[{"name":"Prachi Arora","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, National Institute of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Prachi","lastName":"Arora","id":"37086318993"},{"name":"Nitin Garg","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, National Institute of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Nitin","lastName":"Garg","id":"37086318010"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229875","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Optical transmitters","Optical attenuators","Optical receivers","Safety","Avalanche photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","biological effects of laser radiation","eye","fog","free-space optical communication","light attenuation","optical links","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser eye safety limits","transmission data rate","point-to-point free space optical link","continental fog","retinal safety","RF spectrum","Free Space Optics","atmospheric phenomenon","frequent link outages","detrimental laser hazards","laser power","NRZ-OOK FSO system","nonreturn to zero on-off keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["free space optics (FSO)","fog","attenuation","eye safety","Q factor","transmitted power","received power","beam divergence","data rate"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, the congestion of RF spectrum and increasing demands for high data rate is evident. In such a scenario, Free Space Optics (FSO) is seen as an effective alternative to cater the future bandwidth demands. However, commercial deployment of the technology is hampered owing to the various atmospheric phenomenon that severely limits the link quality of service. Among all the weather conditions, fog causes the maximum attenuation reaching hundreds of decibels per kilometer which results in high data rate drops and frequent link outages. Further, because of detrimental laser hazards in the wavelength band of interest, one cannot increase the laser power beyond a certain limit to improve the system performance. This work analyses NRZ-OOK FSO system under continental foggy conditions keeping in view of laser eye safety limits. Various system parameters such as transmission data rate, beam divergence and avalanche photodiode gain are analyzed. The challenge to operate at lower wavelengths of near infrared band has been discussed. Based on the investigation carried out, the paper is concluded with an optimal parameter selection.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229875","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229875.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulative analysis of NRZ-OOK point-to-point free space optical link under continental fog in view of retinal safety","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Simulative analysis of NRZ-OOK point-to-point free space optical link under continental fog in view of retinal safety","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17449230","htmlLink":"/document/8229875/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulative analysis of NRZ-OOK point-to-point free space optical link under continental fog in view of retinal safety","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"338498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109695S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8229881,"authors":[{"name":"Flevina Jonese D'souza","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Flevina Jonese","lastName":"D'souza","id":"37086273135"},{"name":"Dakshata Panchal","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Dakshata","lastName":"Panchal","id":"37085353085"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229881","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Standards","Heuristic algorithms","Ciphers","Matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced encryption standard security enhancement","data handling","message transmission","electronic transaction","public network","cryptography","messages","symmetric encryption standard","strong encryption algorithm","symmetric algorithm","AES algorithm","brute-force attack","differential attack","linear attack","algebraic attack","dynamic key generation","dynamic S-box generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","Decryption","Dynamic Key","Dynamic S-box","Encryption","S-box"]}],"abstract":"Security is major concern in data handling, communication, message transmission and electronic transaction on public network. Cryptography (secret writing) is the encryption process of transformation of messages to make information secure and resistant to attack. AES is symmetric encryption standard recommended by NIST. AES is proved to be highly secure, faster and strong encryption algorithm. AES is used commonly because of its great competence and easiness. But in recent years cyber-attacks are continuously developing, therefore security specialists must stay busy in the lab inventing new schemes to keep attackers at bay. Possible attacks on symmetric algorithm can be Brute-force Attack, Differential Attack, Algebraic Attack and Linear Attack. So to provide strong security in message transmission, AES algorithm with hybrid approach of Dynamic Key Generation and Dynamic S-box Generation is proposed. In hybrid approach first we will add more complexity in data to increase Confusion and Diffusion in Cipher text by using Dynamic Key Generation and then by using Dynamic S-Box Generation we will make it difficult for attacker to do any down study of static set of S-box.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced encryption standard (AES) security enhancement using hybrid approach","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229881","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229881.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Advanced encryption standard (AES) security enhancement using hybrid approach","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8229881/","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17449133","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced encryption standard (AES) security enhancement using hybrid approach","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"343580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076518S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229888,"authors":[{"name":"Chinnakandukuri Paul Pramod","affiliation":["Dept. of C.S.E., Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Chinnakandukuri Paul","lastName":"Pramod","id":"37086303132"},{"name":"Manjit Jaiswal","affiliation":["Dept. of C.S.E., Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Manjit","lastName":"Jaiswal","id":"37086297805"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229888","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Matrices","Cloud computing","Algorithm design and analysis","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced AES algorithm","flexible S-Box","Cloud Computing","key dependent rotated S-Box","fixed S-box","key-dependent S-Box","data block","Big Data","advance encryption standard encryption technique","block encryption scheme","offline analysis","data storage","word length 400.0 bit","word length 200.0 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","Encryption Techniques","Block Encryption","S-Box Rotation","Swap","Cloud Computing","Data Transmission"]}],"abstract":"This paper suggests a new Advance Encryption Standard (AES) encryption technique.

For cloud resource scheduling we propose an optimization technique for bacterial foraging. Effectively scheduling the tasks on an available physical machine in a cloud environment a unique resource scheduling hyper-heuristic based improved bacteria foraging algorithm (IBFA) has been proposed.

Two major processes in blind image steganalysis are feature extraction and classification.

This paper discusses the importance of heuristic wrapper approach which is an improved version of Particle Swarm Optimization. The fitness function and classification is based on artificial neural network. The neural networks are fast learning and non-linear classifier which gives it an edge over other classifiers. The experiment results show that feature selection technique improves the classification accuracy with reduced number of feature set and provides better understanding of features.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229953","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229953.pdf","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1069","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind image steganalysis using neural networks and wrapper feature selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Blind image steganalysis using neural networks and wrapper feature selection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17449095","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229953/","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind image steganalysis using neural networks and wrapper feature selection","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"713241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067953S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8229960,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086312825"},{"name":"Sukhwinder Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Sukhwinder","lastName":"Singh","id":"38476554700"},{"name":"Jagdish Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38242693100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229960","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Databases","Skin","Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gender classification","auxiliary information","biometrie techniques","face recognition techniques","age classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","Age","Face Recognition","Gender"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays research has explored to extracting auxiliary information from various biometrie techniques such as fingerprints, face, iris, palm, voice etc. This information contains some features like gender, age, beard, mustache, scars, height, hair, skin color, glasses, weight, facial marks, tattoos etc. All this information contributes more and more to identification.

Unfortunately, it comes with the inherent speckle noise which results in the degradation of the texture information in these images, thus making the diagnosis harder. This paper proposes a new approach for despeckling the ultrasound images combining the multiscale anisotropic diffusion model with the non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST). The method involves the decomposition of images using the Non-Subsampled Laplacian pyramid, resulting in a low and high frequency sub images. Modified anisotropic diffusion method is further applied to the coarser component, whereas, the finer component is subjected to shearlet function, resulting in noisy coefficients, which are further subjected to thresholding. This multidimensional and multidirectional method enhances the visual characteristics of the ultrasound images with not just the removal of speckle noise, but also with the preservation of more edges, thus enhancing the images effectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed for real ultrasound images. Results show that the method excels over the earlier proposed techniques in terms of preservation of edges and structural similarities. Moreover, when analysed qualitatively, it is observed that there is a substantial removal of speckle noise, thus making the diagnosis easier for the radiologists.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229964","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1124","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229964.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement of ultrasound images using modified anisotropic diffusion model in non-subsampled shearlet domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement of ultrasound images using modified anisotropic diffusion model in non-subsampled shearlet domain","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8229964/","accessionNumber":"17433951","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229964/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement of ultrasound images using modified anisotropic diffusion model in non-subsampled shearlet domain","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"723338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067566S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8229967,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd.

It is very popular and interesting topic of computer vision. The basic requirement of content based image retrieval is to extract the appropriate information from the large image repository corresponding to query image on the basis of contents with better system performance. But, in the development of CBIR system with an appropriate fusion of low-level features is a big problem. This paper suggested an enhanced retrieval system by using the combination of HSV histogram, discrete wavelet transforms and edge histogram descriptor to extract the relevant information of an image. In this work, we used HSV color histogram with quantized non-uniform 72 bins to extract color information of image, discrete wavelet transform on each component (H, S and V) of HSV image to extract the complex texture pattern of image and global as well as local edge histogram descriptor on V component of HSV image to extract the geometry information of image. Here, Euclidean distance is used as similarity measurement to find out how similar the user image is with respect to the image in the database. For experimental analysis, 600 images of Wang image database are used and the results show that this approach gives good performance in term of precision and adaptableness while comparing with other's combining scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229967","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168800/8229760/08229967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCAA.2017.8229967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8229760","startPage":"1136","endPage":"1141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced CBIR using HSV quantization, discrete wavelet transform and edge histogram descriptor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced CBIR using HSV quantization, discrete wavelet transform and edge histogram descriptor","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8229967/","conferenceDate":"5-6 May 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"17449166","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8229967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced CBIR using HSV quantization, discrete wavelet transform and edge histogram descriptor","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"726367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080855S","chronDate":"5-6 May 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8168800","isNumber":"8229760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168800","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8229760","articleId":"8229967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8229977,"authors":[{"name":"Sarfaraz Masood","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engg, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Sarfaraz","lastName":"Masood","id":"37085544488"},{"name":"Tarun Luthra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engg, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Tarun","lastName":"Luthra","id":"37086311122"},{"name":"Himanshu Sundriyal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engg, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Sundriyal","id":"37086311236"},{"name":"Mumtaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engg, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mumtaz","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37086310827"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6471-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6472-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8229977","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diabetes","Training","Retinopathy","Image color analysis","Computational modeling","Blood vessels","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","eye","feedforward neural nets","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye images","color fundus images","convolutional neural network classifier","Inception V3 network","5-class severity classification","diabetic retinopathy","transfer learning","trained model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diabetic Retinopathy","Convolutional Neural Network","Transfer Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8229977","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks have been performing exceptionally well for the recognition of worldly objects and there are various trained models available which can give you the class of an object if an image of the object is fed as their input.
