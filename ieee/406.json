The key conclusion from the work presented here is that, in the case under study, the optimal quantizer design problem can be partitioned into two sub-problems, namely (i) the design of an optimal analog pre-filter followed by sampling and (ii) an optimal quantizer, which works directly on the pre-sampled signals.

Secondly, we implement face recognition approach via DCT directly with one training sample. Thirdly, we primarily use DCT to generate some low-frequency matrices in frequency domain and then converted into the spatial domain as independent training images. Then, 2DPCA will be used for face recognition. Finally, we use DCT to generate some low-frequency matrices in frequency domain and use DCT to do face recognition. Experiments on the AMP and Yale face database show that the approach DCT+2DPCA produces better results on the AMP database.

The algorithm is suitable not only for stochastic process, but also for deterministic process. To compare effectiveness of the algorithm with that of other estimators, two simulation examples are presented to estimate the amplitudes of sinusoids in white noise with elliptic filter and the algorithm given in this paper. The algorithm is also testified in estimation of the sinusoid's amplitude at some frequency in a fuel cell system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4060574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4060574/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9190358","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of The Amplitude of Sinusoid in White Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of The Amplitude of Sinusoid in White Noise","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"CHICC-00-366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035687S","chronDate":"7-11 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4060207","isNumber":"4060208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060207","xplore-issue":"4060208","articleId":"4060574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TECH COMMITTEE ON CONTROL THEORY","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4060651,"authors":[{"name":"Juhng-perng Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Juhng-perng","lastName":"Su","id":"37281322000"},{"name":"Chian C.

The proposed linear SMC technique not only suppresses the output swing range of all critical integrators effectively, but also avoids the instability limitation of high-order SDM without SNR degradation. This is because the stabilization scheme of the proposed technique leads the output states of all critical integrators to approach the sliding surface promptly and stay within sliding mode steadily, and keeps the overall operation constant through a digital compensative loop. The SIMULINK simulations verify that both stability and dynamic range of SDM can also be improved a lot by this simpler linear SMC technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4060651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4060651/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"9200404","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Oversampling Sigma-Delta Modulator Stabilized by Linear Sliding Mode Control Technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampling Sigma-Delta Modulator Stabilized by Linear Sliding Mode Control Technique","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"CHICC-00-443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04298S","chronDate":"7-11 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4060207","isNumber":"4060208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4060207","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4060208","articleId":"4060651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TECH COMMITTEE ON CONTROL THEORY","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4060655,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanming Ding","affiliation":["Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Ding","id":"37069581100"},{"name":"Akira Sano","affiliation":["Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Sano","id":"37276868400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"7-900669-88-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"7-81077-802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"4060655","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Predistortion","OFDM","Nonlinear distortion","Power system modeling","Inverse problems","Adaptive control","High power amplifiers","Programmable control","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","linearisation techniques","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive nonlinearity compensation","model-matching","time-domain adaptive linearization","high power amplifiers","OFDM systems","power series model","predistorter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Compensation","Linearization","Identification","Power Amplifier (PA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4060655","doi":"10.1109/CHICC.2006.280802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHICC.2006.280802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4060208","publicationTitle":"2006 Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4060207/4060208/04060655.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Nonlinearity Compensation for Power Amplifiers Based on Model-Matching Approach","abstract":"A new time-domain adaptive linearization scheme is presented for compensating nonlinearity of high power amplifiers (HPA) in OFDM systems.

In such cases, a Gaussian assumption is unrealistic and a formulation of a general shape model which accounts for skewness is in order. In this paper, we present a novel statistical method for shape modeling, which we refer to as the flexible skew-symmetric shape model (FSSM). The model is sufficiently flexible to accommodate a departure from Gaussianity of the data and is fairly general to learn a \"mean shape\" (template), with a potential for classification and random generation of new realizations of a given shape. Robustness to skewness results from deriving the FSSM from an extended class of flexible skew-symmetric distributions. In addition, we demonstrate that the model allows us to extract principal curves in a point cloud. The idea is to view a shape as a realization of a spatial random process and to subsequently learn a shape distribution which captures the inherent variability of realizations, provided they remain, with high probability, within a certain neighborhood range around a mean. Specifically, given shape realizations, FSSM is formulated as a joint bimodal distribution of angle and distance from the centroid of an aggregate of random points. Mean shape is recovered from the modes of the distribution, while the maximum likelihood criterion is employed for classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4060926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4060926/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261425","pubMedId":"17269627","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Skew-Symmetric Shape Model for Shape Representation, Classification, and Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Skew-Symmetric Shape Model for Shape Representation, Classification, and Sampling","sourcePdf":"16tip02-baloch.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086737S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4060925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4060925","articleId":"4060926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":4060933,"authors":[{"name":"Wenpeng Ding","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4060925/4060933/4060933-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenpeng Ding received the B.S. degree in 2004 from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D degree in compute science."]},"firstName":"Wenpeng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37528819700"},{"name":"Feng Wu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4060925/4060933/4060933-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Wu (M'99\u2013SM'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Xidian University, China, in 1992, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively.","He joined in Microsoft Research China as an Associate Researcher in 1999.

Instead of alternately applying horizontal and vertical lifting, as in present practice, ADL performs lifting-based prediction in local windows in the direction of high pixel correlation. Hence, it adapts far better to the image orientation features in local windows. The ADL transform is achieved by existing 1-D wavelets and is seamlessly integrated into the global wavelet transform. The predicting and updating signals of ADL can be derived even at the fractional pixel precision level to achieve high directional resolution, while still maintaining perfect reconstruction. To enhance the ADL performance, a rate-distortion optimized directional segmentation scheme is also proposed to form and code a hierarchical image partition adapting to local features. Experimental results show that the proposed ADL-based image coding technique outperforms JPEG 2000 in both PSNR and visual quality, with the improvement up to 2.0 dB on images with rich orientation features","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Directional Lifting-Based Wavelet Transform for Image Coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.888341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4060925/04060933.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.888341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4060925","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4060933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4060933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Directional Lifting-Based Wavelet Transform for Image Coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4060933/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261433","pubMedId":"17269635","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Directional Lifting-Based Wavelet Transform for Image Coding","sourcePdf":"16tip02-ding.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109532S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4060925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"4060925","articleId":"4060933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":4060937,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Gan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Lu Gan (S'02\u2013M'04) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Gan","id":"37266507000"},{"name":"Chengjie Tu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Chengjie Tu (S'02\u2013M'04) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Chengjie","lastName":"Tu","id":"37334594400"},{"name":"Jie Liang","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Jie Liang (S'99\u2013M'04) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Liang","id":"37337013500"},{"name":"Trac D.

Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on \"difficult\" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes ordinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4060945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","volume":"16","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9261437","pubMedId":"17269639","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4060945/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Regularized Iteratively Reweighted MAD Method for Change Detection in Multi- and Hyperspectral Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Regularized Iteratively Reweighted MAD Method for Change Detection in Multi- and Hyperspectral Data","sourcePdf":"16tip02-nielsen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119187S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4060925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"330","xplore-issue":"4060925","articleId":"4060945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4060948,"authors":[{"name":"John P.

This added lightness has been referred to as \"airlight\" in the literature since it is often caused by optical scattering due to fog or mist. A statistical model for scene content is formulated that gives a way of detecting the presence of airlight in an arbitrary image. An algorithm is described for estimating the level of this airlight given the assumption that it is constant throughout the image. This algorithm is based on finding the minimum of a global cost function and is applicable to both monochrome and color images. The method is robust and insensitive to scaling. Once an estimate of airlight is achieved, then image correction is straightforward. The performance of the algorithm is explored using the Monte Carlo simulation with synthetic images under different statistical assumptions.

The region to be inpainted is general: It may be still or moving, in the background or in the foreground, it may occlude one object and be occluded by some other object. The algorithm consists of a simple preprocessing stage and two steps of video inpainting. In the preprocessing stage, we roughly segment each frame into foreground and background. We use this segmentation to build three image mosaics that help to produce time consistent results and also improve the performance of the algorithm by reducing the search space. In the first video inpainting step, we reconstruct moving objects in the foreground that are \"occluded\" by the region to be inpainted. To this end, we fill the gap as much as possible by copying information from the moving foreground in other frames, using a priority-based scheme. In the second step, we inpaint the remaining hole with the background. To accomplish this, we first align the frames and directly copy when possible. The remaining pixels are filled in by extending spatial texture synthesis techniques to the spatiotemporal domain. The proposed framework has several advantages over state-of-the-art algorithms that deal with similar types of data and constraints. It permits some camera motion, is simple to implement, fast, does not require statistical models of background nor foreground, works well in the presence of rich and cluttered backgrounds, and the results show that there is no visible blurring or motion artifacts. A number of real examples taken with a consumer hand-held camera are shown supporting these findings","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Inpainting Under Constrained Camera Motion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.888343","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4060925/04060949.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.888343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4060925","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4060949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4060949/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Video Inpainting Under Constrained Camera Motion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4060949/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261444","pubMedId":"17269646","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Inpainting Under Constrained Camera Motion","sourcePdf":"16tip02-patwardhan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063002S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4060925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"4060925","articleId":"4060949","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4060950,"authors":[{"name":"Lingling Pu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Lingling","lastName":"Pu","id":"37566623700"},{"name":"Zhenyu Wu","affiliation":["Corporate Research, Thomson, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278599200"},{"name":"Ali Bilgin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Bilgin","id":"37281700300"},{"name":"Michael W.

A cyclic coordinate descent optimization procedure is used to solve the MAP formulation, in which the motion fields, segmentation fields, and HR images are found in an alternate manner given the two others, respectively. Specifically, the gradient-based methods are employed to solve the HR image and motion fields, and an iterated conditional mode optimization method to obtain the segmentation fields.

Furthermore, to enhance the quality of restored images, this paper presents a cooperative neural fusion (CNF) algorithm for image fusion. Compared with existing signal-level image fusion algorithms, the proposed CNF algorithm can greatly reduce the loss of contrast information under blind Gaussian noise environments. The performance analysis shows that the proposed two neural fusion algorithms can converge globally to the robust and optimal image estimate.

In contrast with prior work, we extend Bode's integral equation for the case where the preview is made available to the controller via a general, finite capacity, communication system. Under asymptotic stationarity assumptions, our results show that the new fundamental limitation differs from Bode's only by a constant, which quantifies the information rate through the communication system. In the absence of asymptotic stationarity, we derive a universal lower bound which uses Shannon's entropy rate as a measure of performance.

The bioreporters are placed on a CMOS integrated circuit (IC) that detects bioluminescence, performs signal processing and produces a digital output pulse with a frequency that is proportional to the concentration of the target substance. The digital output pulse that contains the sensor information can then be transmitted to a remote location either wirelessly or via a data cable. The basic building blocks of the integrated circuit are the microluminometer and the transmitter. The microluminometer includes an integrated photodetector and a signal processor and is housed in a rugged inexpensive package that can be used in many remote applications in hazardous environmental monitoring. The total power consumption of the entire signal processing circuitry including the photodiodes is 3 mW from a 3.3-V power supply. This is lowered by a factor of 3 when compared to previous versions of the BBIC. In addition, it also integrates all features of detection, processing and data transmission into one small element. The bioreporter typically contains the luxCDABE reporter genes. The close proximity of the bioreporter and the sensing element eliminates the need for complex instrumentation to channel light from the bioreporters to the microluminometer. This paper presents an integrated CMOS microluminometer realized in 0.35-mum CMOS process and optimized for the detection of low-level bioluminescence as part of the BBIC. A flow-through test system was designed to expose the BBIC system composed of the microluminometer and the bioreporter Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL to salicylate for determination of analytical benchmark data. The results obtained from the experiment are currently being used to study enclosures and micro-environment configurations for field-deployable BBICs for environmental monitoring","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.887982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4061002/04061018.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.887982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Circuit Biosensors Using Living Whole-Cell Bioreporters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Circuit Biosensors Using Living Whole-Cell Bioreporters","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9306040","htmlLink":"/document/4061018/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Circuit Biosensors Using Living Whole-Cell Bioreporters","sourcePdf":"54tcsi01-islam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121167S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4061002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4061002","articleId":"4061018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4061019,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Jacob Koickal","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4061002/4061019/4061019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Jacob Koickal received the Ph.D degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India.","From 1998 to 2002, he was a Scientist in the Control and Guidance Design Group at Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, Trivandrum, India.

The CMOS image sensor performs spatially compressing image quantization on the focal plane yielding digital output at a rate proportional to the mere information rate of the video. A bank of column-parallel first-order incremental DeltaSigma-modulated analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) performs column-wise distributed focal-plane oversampling of up to eight adjacent pixels and concurrent weighted average quantization. Number of samples per pixel and switched-capacitor sampling sequence order set the amplitude and sign of the pixel coefficient, respectively. A simple digital delay and adder loop performs spatial accumulation over up to eight adjacent ADC outputs during readout. This amounts to computing a two-dimensional block matrix transform with up to 8times8-pixel programmable kernel in parallel for all columns.

Design optimization towards minimal power consumption is demonstrated for the high-speed low-power building blocks of the DeltaSigma modulator. From this point of view, it is shown that GmC integrators are preferred over RC integrators in the low-pass filter of the modulator because they show a better tradeoff between power, speed, and accuracy. A new single-bit quantizer topology is presented that incorporates a local feedback path that improves stability using a switched-voltage technique. Finally, a design methodology for the single-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in the feedback loop is proposed, focusing on the impact of high sampling rates on the stability of the converter. The presented continuous-time ADC achieves a simulated dynamic range of 72 dB and a signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio of 66 dB in a 10-MHz signal bandwidth. Therefore, it can be applied for WLAN broadband communication. The power consumption of the DeltaSigma modulator is limited to 7.5 mW.

In such applications, it is often required to capture a large amount of data and process them in real time while the hardware is constrained to take very little physical space and to consume very little power. This is only possible using custom single-chip solutions integrating image sensor and hardware-friendly image compression algorithms.

As an example, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) operating in the 3-7-GHz frequency band is used. A noise figure (NF) below 2.3 dB is measured from 3.5 to 7 GHz with NF<1.8 dB between 5-7 GHz. This device survived 33 dBm of available RF input power for 16 h without any change in low-noise performance. The stress mechanisms at high input powers are identified by systematic measurements of an LNA and a single high electron-mobility transistor in the frequency and time domains. It is shown that the gate dc current, which occurs due to self-biasing, is the most critical factor regarding survivability. A series resistance in the gate dc feed can reduce this gate current by feedback, and may be used to improve LNA ruggedness","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.886907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.886907","startPage":"37","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4061036/04061062.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Survivability of GaN Low-Noise Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Survivability of GaN Low-Noise Amplifiers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","volume":"55","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4061062/","accessionNumber":"9257701","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061062/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Survivability of GaN Low-Noise Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tmtt01-rudolph.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050673S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4061036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4061036","articleId":"4061062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4061080,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek P.

Many existing products are equipped with steerable, stand-alone fixed beamformers which provide moderate levels of directivity. Moreover, many applications have long employed the classical adaptive noise canceller configuration with a reference sensor near the noise source to cancel unwanted noise. In this paper, the cascading of stand-alone beamformers with back-end adaptive noise cancellers is studied. A decoupled model for signal enhancement using front-end beamformers and cascaded noise cancellers is presented. The inter-operation of the beamforming and noise canceling units is studied by defining the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) gain, directivity index, and white noise gain offered by the beamforming and noise cancelling components. The performance of decoupled beamformer-noise canceller structures is evaluated using experimental measurements. An experimental procedure for evaluating output SIR is presented.

Classical linear algorithms of model aggregation are compared in the paper with a nonlinear strategy, based on the neural combination of a set of first-level neural estimators.

It is shown in literature that CSI is superior in performance to the other interpolation functions. One of main applications of the CSI is to cooperate with standard DCT-based JPEG to obtain the modified JPEG codec and still obtain a better quality of the reconstructed image for higher compression ratios. This paper shows that the compression performance of such a modified JPEG codec can be further improved by the use of optimal quantization. The optimal quantization makes use of the rate distortion optimization algorithm to measure DCT coefficient statistic for an image generated from the CSI scheme and then construct a DCT quantization table for the given rate/distortion specification. Experimental results show that the proposed optimal quantization can achieve a better PSNR than that of the modified JPEG codec with a default quantization table","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4061132/4061133/04061145.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM'06)","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2006.57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2006.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4061145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCT-Based Image Codec Embedded Cubic Spline Interpolation with Optimal Quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codecs","Spline","Interpolation","Quantization","Transform coding","Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Code standards","Image reconstruction","Rate-distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","image reconstruction","interpolation","rate distortion theory","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT-based image codec","discrete cosine transform","cubic spline interpolation","CSI","optimal quantization","JPEG","image reconstruction","compression performance","rate distortion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"DCT-Based Image Codec Embedded Cubic Spline Interpolation with Optimal Quantization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4061145/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9352614","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2007","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCT-Based Image Codec Embedded Cubic Spline Interpolation with Optimal Quantization","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"274600011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058305S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4061132","isNumber":"4061133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4061132","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4061133","articleId":"4061145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4061176,"authors":[{"name":"Hiromasa Fujihara","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromasa","lastName":"Fujihara","id":"37411633100"},{"name":"Masataka Goto","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Goto","id":"37271633000"},{"name":"Jun Ogata","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37624119000"},{"name":"Kazunori Komatani","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Komatani","id":"37273821000"},{"name":"Tetsuya Ogata","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Ogata","id":"37273829100"},{"name":"Hiroshi G.

Although there were methods that can synchronize between monophonic speech signals and corresponding text transcriptions by using Viterbi alignment techniques, they cannot be applied to vocals in CD recordings because accompaniment sounds often overlap with vocals. To align lyrics with such vocals, we therefore developed three methods: a method for segregating vocals from polyphonic sound mixtures, a method for detecting vocal sections, and a method for adapting a speech-recognizer phone model to segregated vocal signals. Experimental results for 10 Japanese popular-music songs showed that our system can synchronize between music and lyrics with satisfactory accuracy for 8 songs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiple signal classification","CD recording","Viterbi algorithm","Speech recognition","Automatic speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Adaptive signal detection","Informatics","Auditory displays","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio discs","audio recording","audio signal processing","music","speech recognition","synchronisation","Viterbi detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyphonic musical audio signal","speech-recognizer phone model","Japanese song","automatic synchronization","lyrics","music CD recording","Viterbi alignment technique","segregated vocal signal"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2006.38","startPage":"257","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Eighth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4061132/4061133/04061176.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2006.38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Synchronization between Lyrics and Music CD Recordings Based on Viterbi Alignment of Segregated Vocal Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Synchronization between Lyrics and Music CD Recordings Based on Viterbi Alignment of Segregated Vocal Signals","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9352642","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4061176/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Synchronization between Lyrics and Music CD Recordings Based on Viterbi Alignment of Segregated Vocal Signals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"274600257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083404S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4061132","isNumber":"4061133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4061132","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4061133","articleId":"4061176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4061205,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Gruijters","affiliation":["Silicon Hive, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gruijters","id":"37370276000"},{"name":"Bertrand Vandewiele","affiliation":["Silicon Hive, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Vandewiele","id":"38131121800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2746-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4061205","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","OFDM","Application specific processors","Signal processing algorithms","Costs","Application specific integrated circuits","Silicon","Time to market","Digital signal processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost reduction","digital signal processing chips","embedded systems","integrated circuit design","OFDM modulation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algorithm partitioning","system-on-chip","SoC design","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM communication system","multiple application specific processor","cost reduction","ASIC solution","embedded programmable digital signal processor","silicon area","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an algorithm partitioning and SoC design approach for OFDM communication systems using multiple application specific processors.

More specifically, we adapt a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to take into account user specific constraints on the clustering process. Such an algorithm could be applied, e.g., for user specific clustering of Web search results, where the user's constraints on the clustering process are given by a hierarchical folder or bookmark structure.

Most current approaches for Web service discovery cater to semantic Web services, i.e., Web services that have associated semantic descriptions. It is unrealistic, however, to expect all new services to have associated semantic descriptions. Furthermore, the descriptions of the vast majority of already existing services do not have explicitly associated semantics. In this paper we present a novel approach for Web service discovery that combines semantic and statistical association metrics. Semantic metrics are based on the semantic aspects of relevant ontology. Statistical association metrics are based on the association aspects of Web services instances (their inputs and outputs). Specifically, our approach exploits semantic relationship ranking for establishing semantic relevance, and a hyperclique pattern discovery method for grouping Web service parameters into meaningful associations. These associations combined by the semantic relevance are then leveraged to discover and rank Web services","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI 2006 Main Conference Proceedings)(WI'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4061321/4061322/04061447.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Service Discovery via Semantic Association Ranking and Hyperclique Pattern Discovery","doi":"10.1109/WI.2006.194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WI.2006.194","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4061447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Web Service Discovery via Semantic Association Ranking and Hyperclique Pattern Discovery","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9451861","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4061447/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Service Discovery via Semantic Association Ranking and Hyperclique Pattern Discovery","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"274700649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040797S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4061321","isNumber":"4061322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4061321","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4061322","articleId":"4061447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4061468,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Liu","affiliation":["Information Engineering Institute, Information and Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405144800"},{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Information Engineering Institute, Information and Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37833642500"},{"name":"Qingxian Wang","affiliation":["Information Engineering Institute, Information and Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Qingxian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291368900"},{"name":"Yao Liu","affiliation":["Information Engineering Institute, Information and Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Liu","id":"38128678600"},{"name":"Liang Wei","affiliation":["Information Engineering Institute, Information and Engineering University, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37828471900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2747-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4061468","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web pages","Partitioning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Entropy","Testing","Information analysis","Costs","Energy measurement","Technological innovation","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval","learning (artificial intelligence)","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scoring method","block importance estimation learning problem","vision-based Web page segmentation algorithm","Web page semantic block partitioning","spatial feature representation","content feature representation","entropy-based method","BlockEvaluator algorithm","Web sites","news extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4061468","abstract":"The estimation of the block importance could be defined as a learning problem.

Algorithmic improvements and FPGA-based hardware implementations of ray tracing have demonstrated realtime performance but hardware that achieves performance levels comparable to commodity rasterization graphics chips is still not available. This paper describes the architecture and ASIC implementations of the DRPU design (dynamic ray processing unit) that closes this performance gap. The DRPU supports fully programmable shading and most kinds of dynamic scenes and thus provides similar capabilities as current GPUs. It achieves high efficiency due to SIMD processing of floating point vectors, massive multithreading, synchronous execution of packets of threads, and careful management of caches for scene data. To support dynamic scenes B-KD trees are used as spatial index structures that are processed by a custom traversal and intersection unit and modified by an update processor on scene changes. The DRPU architecture is specified as a high-level structural description in a functional language and mapped to both FPGA and ASIC implementations. Our FPGA prototype clocked at 66 MHz achieves higher ray tracing performance than CPU-based ray tracers even on a modern multi-GHz CPU.

Today, the resulting power consumption and heat dissipation threaten to end this trend, and CPU designers are looking for alternative ways of providing more compute power. In particular, they are looking towards three concepts: a streaming compute model, vector-like SIMD units, and multi-core architectures. One particular example of such an architecture is the cell broadband engine architecture (CBEA), a multi-core processor that offers a raw compute power of up to 200 GFlops per 3.2 GHz chip. The cell bears a huge potential for compute-intensive applications like ray tracing, but also requires addressing the challenges caused by this processor's unconventional architecture. In this paper, we describe an implementation of realtime ray tracing on a cell. Using a combination of low-level optimized kernel routines, a streaming software architecture, explicit caching, and a virtual software-hyperthreading approach to hide DMA latencies, we achieve for a single cell a pure ray tracing performance of nearly one order of magnitude over that achieved by a commodity CPU","doi":"10.1109/RT.2006.280210","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Interactive Ray Tracing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Interactive Ray Tracing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4061529/4061530/04061541.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RT.2006.280210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061530","startPage":"15","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray Tracing on the Cell Processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4061541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ray Tracing on the Cell Processor","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061541/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9231268","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4061541/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray Tracing on the Cell Processor","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"RT-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072744S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4061529","isNumber":"4061530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4061529","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4061530","articleId":"4061541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4061542,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The highest quality acceleration structures are generally agreed to be those built using greedy cost optimization based on a surface area heuristic (SAH). This technique is most often applied to the construction of kd-trees, as in this work, but is equally applicable to the construction of other hierarchical acceleration structures. Unfortunately, SAH-optimized data structure construction has previously been too slow to allow per-frame rebuilding for interactive ray tracing of dynamic scenes, leading to the use of lower-quality acceleration structures for this application. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that high-quality SAH based acceleration structures can be constructed quickly enough to make them a viable option for interactive ray tracing of dynamic scenes. We present a scanning-based algorithm for choosing kd-tree split planes that are close to optimal with respect to the SAH criteria. Our approach approximates the SAH cost function across the spatial domain with a piecewise quadratic function with bounded error and picks minima from this approximation. This algorithm takes full advantage of SIMD operations (e.g., SSE) and has favorable memory access patterns. In practice this algorithm is faster than sorting-based SAH build algorithms with the same asymptotic time complexity, and is competitive with non-SAH build algorithms which produce lower-quality trees. The resulting trees are almost as good as those produced by a sorting-based SAH builder as measured by ray tracing time.

Computational efficiency has been the main focus of previous work on ray tracing point-sampled surfaces. For very complex models efficient storage in the form of compression becomes necessary in order to avoid costly disk access. However, as ray tracing requires neighborhood queries, existing compression schemes cannot be applied because of their sequential nature. This paper introduces a novel acceleration structure called the quantized kd-tree, which offers both efficient traversal and storage. The gist of our new representation lies in quantizing the kd-tree splitting plane coordinates. We show that the quantized kd-tree reduces the memory footprint up to 18 times, not compromising performance. Moreover, the technique can also be employed to provide LOD (level-of-detail) to reduce aliasing problems, with little additional storage cost","doi":"10.1109/RT.2006.280221","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Interactive Ray Tracing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Symposium on Interactive Ray Tracing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4061529/4061530/04061552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RT.2006.280221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4061530","startPage":"105","endPage":"113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Quantized kd-Tree: Efficient Ray Tracing of Compressed Point Clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4061552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Quantized kd-Tree: Efficient Ray Tracing of Compressed Point Clouds","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4061552/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9231279","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4061552/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Quantized kd-Tree: Efficient Ray Tracing of Compressed Point Clouds","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"RT-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097518S","chronDate":"18-20 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4061529","isNumber":"4061530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4061529","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4061530","articleId":"4061552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4061558,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Abert","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t Koblenz-Landau, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Abert","id":"37698086300"},{"name":"Markus Geimer","affiliation":["Forschungszentrum Julich, Switzerland","Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Geimer","id":"37595684100"},{"name":"Stefan Muller","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t Koblenz-Landau"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Muller","id":"37592777100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0693-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4061558","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":424},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Spline","Surface topography","Surface reconstruction","Computer graphics","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational geometry","Polynomials","Solid modeling","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","rendering (computer graphics)","splines (mathematics)","surface fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NURBS surface","Bezier surface","interactive ray tracing","interactive rendering","Cox-de Boor recursion","free-form surface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ray tracing","NURBS","free-form surfaces","interactive rendering"]}],"abstract":"Recently it has been shown that Bezier surfaces can be used as a geometric primitive for interactive ray tracing on a single commodity PC. However, the Bezier representation is restricted, as a large number of control points also imply a high polynomial degree, thus reducing the frame rate significantly. In this work we present a fast, efficient and robust algorithm to ray trace trimmed NURBS surfaces of arbitrary degree. Furthermore, our approach is largely independent of the number of control points of a surface with respect to the rendering performance. Additionally the degree and the number of control points of a surface do not influence the numerical stability of the intersection algorithm. The desired high performance is achieved by taking a novel approach of surface evaluation, which requires only minimal preprocessing.

This very promising approach should constitute the second generation of MRAM switching technology; it features small switching current (~120uA) and high programming speed (<1ns). The macro-model has been developed in Verilog-A language and implemented on Cadence Virtuoso platform with Spectre 5.0.32 simulator.

We also considered a parallelization technique of enhanced integration historical data method in order to decrease its working time.

The ANN has been trained on the base of measurement results in order to approximate measurement results of toxicity of exhaust gas components. Measurements data which have been used to training ANN cover a wide range of steady state engine operating conditions (more then 230). The ANN modelling accuracy has been controlled by optimisation method which has been used in order to find the influence of given centres of Gauss function. Outputs from the ANN for some set of control parameters are compared with measurements. A good correspondence of results has been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/IDAACS.2005.282958","pdfPath":"/iel5/4062069/4062070/04062109.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems: Technology and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS.2005.282958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of Artificial Neural Network to Diesel Engine Modelling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4062109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"An Application of Artificial Neural Network to Diesel Engine Modelling","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","accessionNumber":"10185567","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/4062109/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application of Artificial Neural Network to Diesel Engine Modelling","confLoc":"Sofia, Bulgaria","sourcePdf":"IDAACS-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054403S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4062069","isNumber":"4062070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062069","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4062070","articleId":"4062109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4062123,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

As input signal a rectangle 16-QAM corrupted by different levels of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) was used. The nonlinearities caused by the amplifier in low IBO operating conditions can change the output constellation and lead to difficulties in finding the correct model parameters, as the black-box identification procedure is based on measured input/output signals. These signals can be altered by different types of noise. The AWGN degrades the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and can lower the model accuracy that should ideally not be influenced. In this paper the models were first estimated using noise-free data (NFD) and secondly with different levels of noisy corrupted data (NCD). NFD was also applied to the models calculated with NCD and vice versa. An investigation of the loss of accuracy caused by the noise in the identified models is presented. Three situations were considered: 6dB IBO, 4dB IBO, and 2dB IBO.

Current On-Board Diagnosis (OBD II) systems use simple rules and maps to perform diagnosis, and significant human intervention is needed to troubleshoot a problem. More research is needed on developing innovative, easy-to-use automated diagnostic approaches for incorporation into the OBD systems. In addition, developing intelligent remote diagnosis technology, building a bridge between on-board and off-board diagnosis are open areas of research in the automotive industry.Here, we propose a systematic data-driven process that utilizes knowledge from signal- processing and statistical domains to detect and diagnose faults in automotive engines. The proposed approach is applied to a Toyota Camry engine, and the experimental results are presented in detail. The experimental system consists of an engine running with manual transmission on a dynamometer test- stand. For our experiments, the data for five faults (three sensor faults and two physical faults) with different severity levels under various operating conditions (e.g., different throttle angles, engine speeds, etc) is collected from the engine, and the application of a data-driven diagnostic process is examined.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Fault detection","Fault diagnosis","Automotive engineering","Engines","Intelligent vehicles","Automobiles","Humans","Intelligent structures","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","engines","fault diagnosis","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic data driven process","real time fault detection","automotive engines","signal processing","statistical domains"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.2006.283654","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Autotestcon","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Autotestcon","pdfPath":"/iel5/4062300/4062301/04062335.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTEST.2006.283654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Data-Driven Approach to Real-Time Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Automotive Engines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4062335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Data-Driven Approach to Real-Time Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Automotive Engines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4062335/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4062335/","accessionNumber":"10207648","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Data-Driven Approach to Real-Time Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Automotive Engines","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"AUTEST-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067297S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4062300","isNumber":"4062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062300","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4062301","articleId":"4062335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4062366,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Ginart","affiliation":["Impact Technologies LLC, USA"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Ginart","id":"37295693300"},{"name":"Irtaza Barlas","affiliation":["Impact Technologies LLC, USA"],"firstName":"Irtaza","lastName":"Barlas","id":"37300874200"},{"name":"Jonathan Goldin","affiliation":["Impact Technologies LLC, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Goldin","id":"38181154600"},{"name":"Jordan Lewis Dorrity","affiliation":["Impact Technologies LLC, USA"],"firstName":"Jordan Lewis","lastName":"Dorrity","id":"37355136700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0052-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0051-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1088-7725"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4550"}],"articleNumber":"4062366","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computerized monitoring","Prognostics and health management","Condition monitoring","Machinery","Fault detection","Feature extraction","Sensor systems","Acceleration","System performance","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","condition monitoring","feature extraction","machine testing","machinery","vibration measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated feature selection","embeddable prognostic","alarm settings","automatic health monitoring","industrial machinery vibration"]}],"abstract":"This work presents novel approaches for feature selection and alarm settings that can be exploited by automatic health monitoring systems that use vibrations of industrial machinery as a primary source for detection of failures and incipient faults.

Coupled with autonomic logistics for unprecedented responsiveness, cost effectiveness, and mission availability, PHM is largely automated in its application. Incorporating the principles of condition-based maintenance (CBM) along with the tenets of reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), the PHM paradigm extends these capabilities and provides a robust environment to optimize maintenance and logistics for increased operational availability (A\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n), and reduced life-cycle costs (LCC) while potentially increasing the reliability and life expectancy of mechanical, structural, and electronic systems. Driven by a demand for greater reliability at reduced cost and fueled by technological advancements, the PHM contribution to an already robust and confounding vocabulary surrounding maintenance and logistics is significant. As adopters of PHM technology attempt to define requirements and performance parameters, difficulties encountered with various non- standardized terminology indicate that the PHM vocabulary merits a lexical review. This paper will provide a compendium of PHM terminology along with definitions and examples, derived from the authors' experience in the implementation of PHM systems. Coalescing existing vocabularies and introducing, formally, the new lexicon of maintenance and logistics, the authors seek to aid in clarification of the emerging dialogue of life-cycle support.","doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.2006.283685","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Autotestcon","pdfPath":"/iel5/4062300/4062301/04062398.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTEST.2006.283685","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Autotestcon","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defining PHM, A Lexical Evolution of Maintenance and Logistics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4062398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Defining PHM, A Lexical Evolution of Maintenance and Logistics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4062398/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4062398/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10207692","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defining PHM, A Lexical Evolution of Maintenance and Logistics","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"AUTEST-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043378S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4062300","isNumber":"4062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062300","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4062301","articleId":"4062398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4062443,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A promising research area in particular are telemanipulation tasks where vibrations occurring in the remote environment are fed back through tactile displays. Two experiments concerning the perception of vibrations were conducted. The first experiment aims at determining whether vibrations are coded primarily by frequency, amplitude, or acceleration by human subjects. Results show that primarily frequency and amplitude, but not acceleration of the vibrations were perceived. In the second experiment, subjects' just noticeable difference (JND) for frequency under different conditions was examined. The resulting JND of 18% for frequencies showed neither dependence on amplitude or acceleration, which were independently held constant, nor on the reference frequencies. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust the subjective intensity for vibrations for each human operator when designing tactile displays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Humans","Displays","Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Vibration measurement","Frequency synthesizers","Vibration control","Conferences","Haptic interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["haptic interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vibrotactile perception","high-frequency vibrations","telemanipulation","remote environment","tactile displays","vibration coding","tactile feedback"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HAVE.2006.283803","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Workshop on Haptic Audio Visual Environments and their Applications (HAVE 2006)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Workshop on Haptic Audio Visual Environments and their Applications (HAVE 2006)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4062507/4062508/04062549.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HAVE.2006.283803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vibrotactile Perception: Differential Effects of Frequency, Amplitude, and Acceleration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4062549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vibrotactile Perception: Differential Effects of Frequency, Amplitude, and Acceleration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4062549/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4062549/","accessionNumber":"9264562","conferenceDate":"4-5 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vibrotactile Perception: Differential Effects of Frequency, Amplitude, and Acceleration","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"HAVE2006_72-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078026S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"4062507","isNumber":"4062508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062507","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4062508","articleId":"4062549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4062569,"authors":[{"name":"Huicheng Chi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4062555/4062569/4062569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huicheng Chi received the BEng degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003.","He is currently a MPhil candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Since the demands of different clients are asynchronous and the contents of clients' buffers are continuously changing, finding partners with expected data and collaborating with them for future content delivery are very important and challenging problems. In this paper, we propose a generic buffer-assisted search (BAS) scheme to improve partner search efficiency by reducing the size of index overlay. We have also developed a novel scheduling algorithm based on deadline-aware network coding (DNC) to fully exploit network resources by dynamically adjusting the coding window size. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that BAS can provide a faster response time with less control cost than the existing search methods, and DNC improves the network capacity utilization and provides high streaming quality under different network conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4062569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9311979","volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4062569/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient search and scheduling in P2P-based media-on-demand streaming service","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient search and scheduling in P2P-based media-on-demand streaming service","sourcePdf":"js_0701_119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066829S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4062555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4062555","articleId":"4062569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4062601,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The analysis and classification of Partial Discharge based on its site of occurrence is a complex process notwithstanding the intricacies involved in the digital computer acquisition system, since partial discharge is inherently a stochastic and a non-Markovian process in which there can be significant statistical variability. Since each defect has a particular deterioration mechanism, it is imperative to discern the correlation between the discharge patterns and the nature of defect in order to ascertain the quality of insulation. Neural Network which is a non-parametric method has been a recent innovative technique suitable for partial discharge pattern classification. The Back Propagation Algorithm Neural Network is verified and validated for the various inputs based on established validation techniques. As against the conventional technique of using mathematical descriptors adopted by previous researchers, unique characteristic input feature vectors have been devised in this work in order to provide a possible solution to a simple yet an effective preprocessing methodology.

The network consists of 8 signal receiving stations and works using the Time-Of-Arrival (TOA) technique. Area covered by the network includes: Java Island, Bali Island, Southern part of Sumatra Island, Southern part of Kalimantan Island, and Southern part of Sulawesi Island. The present work reports on the lightning stroke density obtained by the TOA network for 5 consecutive years from 1996 to 2000 on the Java Island. Maps of the lightning stroke density and its annual variations are presented. Further, monthly variation of the detected lightning strokes is also discussed. Lightning activity on the Island shows a consistent high density. The spatial and temporal distribution of lightning activity on the Island as reported by Hidayat and Ishii are confirmed. The density obtained using the present network is comparable to that reported by Hidayat and Ishii. On the other hand, the current amplitude is almost two-fold higher with an increasing tendency from 1995 to 1999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4062798/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4062798/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9251797","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Observation of Lightning Discharges in Indonesia by Lightning Detection Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observation of Lightning Discharges in Indonesia by Lightning Detection Network","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ICPADM-00-209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083858S","chronDate":"June  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4062588","isNumber":"4062589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062588","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4062589","articleId":"4062798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4062836,"authors":[{"name":"Pulak K.

The needs of system-level verification and software/hardware co-design also prefer behavior-level executable specifications, such as C or SystemC. In this paper we present the platform-based synthesis system, named xPilot, being developed at UCLA. The first objective of xPilot is to provide novel behavioral synthesis capability for automatically generating efficient RTL code from a C or SystemC description for a given system platform and optimizing the logic, interconnects, performance, and power simultaneously. The second objective of xPilot is to provide a platform-based system-level synthesis capability, including both synthesis for application-specific configurable processors and heterogeneous multi-core systems. Preliminary experiments on FPGAs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a wide range of applications and its value in exploring various design tradeoffs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","System-on-a-chip","Control system synthesis","Electronic design automation and methodology","Costs","Productivity","Design optimization","Electronics industry","Design automation","Logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","logic design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["platform-based behavior-level synthesis","system-level synthesis","system-on-a-chip design","electronic design automation","register transfer level synthesis","system-level verification","software/hardware co-design","behavior-level executable specifications","SystemC description","xPilot","RTL code","application-specific configurable processors","heterogeneous multicore systems","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063049","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2006.283880","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4062990/4062991/04063049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2006.283880","startPage":"199","endPage":"202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062991","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International SOC Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Platform-Based Behavior-Level and System-Level Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Platform-Based Behavior-Level and System-Level Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063049/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4063049/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10187609","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Platform-Based Behavior-Level and System-Level Synthesis","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SOCC-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100604S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4062990","isNumber":"4062991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062990","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4062991","articleId":"4063049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4063059,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Ding","id":"37988658800"},{"name":"Rong Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Luo","id":"37286614900"},{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292556200"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291236500"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37275778900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9782-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9781-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"4063059","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Threshold voltage","Monte Carlo methods","Circuit simulation","Neutrons","Timing","Error analysis","Computer science","Computer errors","Computational modeling","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","semiconductor process modelling","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process variation impact","critical charge distribution","soft error vulnerability","Monte Carlo analysis","storage circuits","SRAM","benchmark circuit","empirical model","gate length variations","threshold voltage variations"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of process variation on soft error vulnerability with Monte Carlo analysis.

Different cache organizations make tradeoffs between these metrics. One of the main architectural choices is whether to use standard SRAM-based tag design or to go with a CAM- based organization. This choice has far reaching consequences on all other aspects of the cache design. We will compare these two cache styles using results from a recently completed DSP core design. Our conclusion is that, contrary to popular belief, an SRAM-tag based design provided a more optimal overall design point and is superior in energy respect. Some of driving factors such as the increasing dominance of wire and leakage power will be extrapolated forward to next generation processes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Process design","Timing","Jacobian matrices","Standards organizations","Wire","Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Random access memory","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","content-addressable storage","embedded systems","integrated circuit design","leakage currents","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache organization","embedded processor design","CAM-tag based cache designs","standard SRAM-tag based cache designs","DSP core design comparison","leakage power","content addressable memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063071","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2006.283902","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4062990/4062991/04063071.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4062991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2006.283902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063071/","displayDocTitle":"Cache Organization for Embeded Processors: CAM-vs-SRAM","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","accessionNumber":"10206127","htmlLink":"/document/4063071/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache Organization for Embeded Processors: CAM-vs-SRAM","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SOCC-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053242S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4062990","isNumber":"4062991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4062990","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4062991","articleId":"4063071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4063072,"authors":[{"name":"William Robert Reohr","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The DT-CWT has been proved to provide a complete and effective tool for Quickbird image fusion","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2006.887056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4063275/04063295.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2006.887056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the Dual-Tree Complex and Shift-Invariant Discrete Wavelet Transforms on Quickbird Image Fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063295/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the Dual-Tree Complex and Shift-Invariant Discrete Wavelet Transforms on Quickbird Image Fusion","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9268858","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4063295/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the Dual-Tree Complex and Shift-Invariant Discrete Wavelet Transforms on Quickbird Image Fusion","sourcePdf":"04lgrs01-ioannidou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06488S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4063275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4063275","articleId":"4063295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4063302,"authors":[{"name":"Liguo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Liguo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37635157200"},{"name":"Xiuping Jia","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Campbell, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiuping","lastName":"Jia","id":"37274086500"},{"name":"Ye Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279965600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4063302","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, a geometry-based feature-selection method is proposed for efficient analysis of hyperspectral imagery.

The keystone transform has been employed to remove the linear component of the range migration for the moving target, where interpolation is required. In this letter, a realization of the keystone transform avoiding interpolation is presented. The kernel of this transform, i.e., the range-frequency-dependent azimuth time rescaling, is implemented using only complex multiplications and fast Fourier transforms based on the scaling principle, which has been successfully applied in the equalization of the space-variant range cell migration in SAR processing. In addition, the moving target is coarsely focused according to the SAR geometry and the platform velocity while exploiting the scaling principle. This preliminary focusing is helpful in the isolation of the moving target from ground clutter, so as to facilitate a more refined processing with respect to each mover. SAR raw data combined with simulated echoes of moving targets are utilized to validate the presented approach","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4063275/04063317.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2006.882147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2006.882147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Keystone Transform Without Interpolation for SAR Ground Moving-Target Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Focusing","Synthetic aperture radar","Fast Fourier transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Trajectory","Azimuth","Geometry","Radar imaging","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","radar imaging","radar tracking","synthetic aperture radar","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["keystone transform","SAR ground moving-target imaging","synthetic aperture radar image formation","target trajectory","range migration linear component","transform kernel","azimuth time rescaling","fast Fourier transforms","space variant range cell migration","SAR processing","SAR geometry","platform velocity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ground moving-target imaging (GMTIm)","keystone transform","scaling principle","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Keystone Transform Without Interpolation for SAR Ground Moving-Target Imaging","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4063317/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9268834","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Keystone Transform Without Interpolation for SAR Ground Moving-Target Imaging","sourcePdf":"04lgrs01-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063213S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4063275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"4063275","articleId":"4063317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4063354,"authors":[{"name":"Sarp Erturk","affiliation":["Kocaeli University Laboratory of Image and Signal Processing (KULIS), Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department, University of Kocaeli, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sarp","lastName":"Erturk","id":"37267855900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4063354","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":109,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Video compression","Signal processing algorithms","Videoconference","Band pass filters","Kernel","High definition video","Computational complexity","Video coding","HDTV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplication-free one-bit transform","low-complexity block-based motion estimation","filter kernel","image frames","macro-block level","integer arithmetic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matching","motion estimation","one-bit transform (1BT)","video coding"]}],"abstract":"A multiplication-free one-bit transform (1BT) for low-complexity block-based motion estimation is presented in this letter.

Because these perturbations (which can be introduced through manufacturing imperfections, cabling stresses, installation procedures, and environmental sensitivities of fiber and other in-line components) are unknowable and continually changing, PMD is unique among optical impairments. This makes PMD both a fascinating research subject and potentially one of the most challenging technical obstacles for future optoelectronic transmission. Mitigation and compensation techniques, proper emulation, and accurate prediction of PMD-induced outage probabilities critically depend on the understanding and modeling of the statistics of PMD in installed links. Using extensive data on buried fibers used in long-haul high-speed links, the authors discuss the proposition that most of the temporal PMD changes that are observed in installed routes arise primarily from a relatively small number of \"hot spots\" along the route that are exposed to the ambient environment, whereas the buried shielded sections remain largely stable for month-long time periods. It follows that the temporal variations of the differential group delay for any given channel constitute a distinct statistical distribution with its own channel-specific mean value. The impact of these observations on outage statistics is analyzed, and the implications for future optoelectronic fiber-based transmission are discussed","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization Mode Dispersion of Installed Fibers","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.885781","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4063381/04063384.pdf","startPage":"4584","endPage":"4599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.885781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Polarization Mode Dispersion of Installed Fibers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4063384/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9256099","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization Mode Dispersion of Installed Fibers","sourcePdf":"24jlt12-brodsky.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124467S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4063381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4063381","articleId":"4063384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4063385,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Cardenas","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Optical Communications Group, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4063381/4063385/4063385-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel C\u00e1rdenas received the M.

Two types of development can reduce the cost dramatically. The first is via the improvement of physical-link communication efficiency by an order of magnitude using photon-counting receivers for vacuum channels, system complexity, weight, and power for space systems can be greatly reduced.

This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in silicon photonics and outlines challenges that must be overcome before large-scale commercialization can occur. In particular, for realization of integration with CMOS very large scale integration (VLSI), silicon photonics must be compatible with the economics of silicon manufacturing and must operate within thermal constraints of VLSI chips. The impact of silicon photonics will reach beyond optical communication-its traditionally anticipated application.

A lot of unique features can be expected, such as low-power consumption, wafer-level testing, small packaging capability, and so on. The market of VCSELs has been growing up rapidly in recent years, and they are now key devices in local area networks using multimode optical fibers. Also, long wavelength VCSELs are currently attracting much interest for use in single-mode fiber metropolitan area and wide area network applications. In addition, a VCSEL-based disruptive technology enables various consumer applications such as a laser mouse and laser printers. In this paper, the recent advance of VCSEL photonics will be reviewed, which include the wavelength extension of single-mode VCSELs and their wavelength integration/control.

This change will require new access networks that support high-speed (> 100 Mb/s), symmetric, and guaranteed bandwidths for future video services with high-definition TV quality. To satisfy the required bandwidth over a 20-km transmission distance, single-mode optical fiber is currently the only practical choice. To minimize the cost of implementing an FTTP solution, a passive optical network (PON) that uses a point-to-multipoint architecture is generally considered to be the best approach. There are several multiple-access techniques to share a single PON architecture, and the authors addressed several of these approaches such as time-division multiple access, wavelength-division multiple access, subcarrier multiple access, and code-division multiple access. Among these multiple techniques, they focus on time-division multiplexing (TDM)-PON and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)-PON, which will be the most promising candidates for practical future systems. A TDM-PON shares a single-transmission channel with multiple subscribers in time domain. Then, there exists tight coupling between subscribers. A WDM-PON provides point-to-point optical connectivity using a dedicated pair of wavelengths per user. While a TDM-PON appears to be a satisfactory solution for current bandwidth demands, the combination of future data-rate projections and traffic patterns coupled with recent advances in WDM technology may result in WDM-PON becoming the preferred solution for a future proof fiber-based access network","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063381","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4063381/04063414.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2006.885779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2006.885779","startPage":"4568","endPage":"4583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber to the Home Using a PON Infrastructure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063414/","displayDocTitle":"Fiber to the Home Using a PON Infrastructure","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4063414/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"9256098","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber to the Home Using a PON Infrastructure","sourcePdf":"24jlt12-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087735S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4063381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"4063381","articleId":"4063414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4063429,"authors":[{"name":"Philip St.J.

In particular, OLS routers with wavelength routing switching fabrics and parallel optical labeling allow forwarding of asynchronously arriving variable-length packets, bursts, and circuits. By exploiting contention resolution in wavelength, time, and space domains, the OLS routers can achieve high throughput without resorting to a store-and-forward method associated with large buffer requirements. Testbed demonstrations employing OLS edge routers show high-performance networking in support of multimedia and data communications applications over the photonic Internet with optical packets and bursts switched directly at the optical layer. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","htmlLink":"/document/4063447/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9256091","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical Packet and Burst Switching Technologies for the Future Photonic Internet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Packet and Burst Switching Technologies for the Future Photonic Internet","sourcePdf":"24jlt12-yoo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.256536S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4063381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"4063381","articleId":"4063447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4063449,"authors":[{"name":"Bernard Yurke","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4063381/4063449/4063449-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bernard Yurke received the B.S. and M.A. degrees in physics from the University of Texas at Austin.

The kinetic inductance exhibited by superconducting transmission lines provides an example of a Kerr-like nonlinearity that is accompanied by a nonlinear resistance of the two-photon absorptive type. Such nonlinear dissipation can degrade the performance of amplifiers and mixers employing a Kerr-like nonlinearity as the gain or mixing medium. As an aid for parametric-amplifier design, the authors provide a quantum analysis of a cavity parametric amplifier employing a Kerr nonlinearity that is accompanied by a two-photon absorptive loss. Because of their usefulness in diagnostics, we obtain expressions for the pump amplitude within the cavity, the reflection coefficient for the pump amplitude reflected off of the cavity, the parametric gain, and the intermodulation gain. Expressions by which the degree of squeezing can be computed are also presented.

In this work we introduce a discrete lattice wavelet transform (DLWT). In the analysis part, the lattice structure contains two parallel transmission channels, which exchange information via two crossed lattice filters.

We derive a simple form for a distance metric that characterizes the code performance in the presence of transmit correlation, and propose some design criteria to build good space time trellis codes (STTCs) for correlated channels. For the case of two transmit antennas, we show that in strongly correlated channels, performance is governed by the constellation that results from the sum of the constellations associated with the transmit antennas. This suggests the use of new constellations to design better codes for correlated channels. The design criteria are then extended to any number of transmit antennas. Based on these criteria, we derive new STTCs for two and three transmit antennas that perform much better in correlated channels than the STTC optimized for the independent and identically distributed case. We also consider set partitioning applied to the sum constellation as a simple technique to design good codes for correlated channels. The codes derived show performance close to the codes found by an exhaustive search. Finally, we consider antenna selection as an alternative to build good codes for more than two antennas in fading-correlated scenarios. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4063491/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9258068","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Space\u2013Time Trellis Codes for Transmit-Correlated Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Space\u2013Time Trellis Codes for Transmit-Correlated Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"55tcomm01-amat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07408S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4063485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4063485","articleId":"4063491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4063492,"authors":[{"name":"Kamtorn Ausavapattanakun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4063485/4063492/4063492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kamtorn Ausavapattanakun was born in Bangkok, Thailand, in 1975.

A two-step design process is proposed for minimizing the total transmit power while satisfying every user's minimum data rate and maximum bit-error rate (BER) requirements. First, the BER and rate requirements are converted to \"virtual rate\" requirements, which account for the gap-to-capacity introduced by practical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and THP. The second step is to determine the transmit covariance matrices (which specify the entire THP system) that will provide these virtual rates at the minimum total transmit power. As one of the main features in the proposed scheme, an algorithm for finding the optimal user encoding (or presubtraction) order in polynomial time is proposed. In addition, we also propose an algorithm that finds a near-optimal order, but which is much less complex.

This paper provides several examples of scalar (single-input single-output) fading channels and shows that on these channels the performance of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes lies in close proximity to the performance limits identified by Root and Varaiya. Specifically, we consider periodic fading channels and partial-band jamming (PBJ) channels. A special case of periodic fading is the variation of signal-to-noise ratio across orthogonal frequency division modulation subchannels. The robustness of LDPC codes to periodic fading and PBJ across parameterizations of these different channels is demonstrated through the consistency of the required mutual information to provide a specified bit error rate. For the periodic fading case, the Gaussian approximation to density evolution has been adapted such that asymptotic threshold measures can be compared to simulated code performance in various periodic fading scenarios","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.885081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4063485/04063507.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.885081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Universal Operation of LDPC Codes Over Scalar Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"The Universal Operation of LDPC Codes Over Scalar Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063507/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9258069","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4063507/","volume":"55","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Universal Operation of LDPC Codes Over Scalar Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"55tcomm01-jones.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095648S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4063485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4063485","articleId":"4063507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4063508,"authors":[{"name":"Mari Kobayashi","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4063485/4063508/4063508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mari Kobayashi (M'06) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 1999, and the M.S. degree in mobile radio, and the Ph.D. degree from Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","Since November 2005, she has been a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.

Both extended range and/or improved bandwidth efficiency can be achieved, compared with a radio link with a single transmit and receive antenna. Bit-interleaved coded modulation schemes give diversity gains on fading channels with higher order modulation constellations combined with conventional binary convolutional codes also for the case of a single transmit and receive antenna radio link. In this paper, we study a family of flexible bandwidth-efficient ST coding schemes which combine these two ideas in a narrowband flat-fading channel and single-carrier modems. We address receiver complexity for the case of a large number of transmit antennas and higher order modulation constellations. Especially, we focus on practical configurations, where the number of transmit antennas is greater than that of receive antennas.

While the MLyC has been known to achieve ergodic fading channel capacity, the problem of interest here is to design practical and efficient MLyC for nonergodic block-fading channels. We develop a design methodology which maximizes the information rate of MLyC, subject to an upper bound on the decoding error probability. Moreover, we show that the MLyC performs closer to channel capacity when the overall diversity order of the channel is higher and proper spatial interleaving is employed. The relationship between the MLyC scheme and other transmission techniques, such as multilevel coded modulation and bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM), is also discussed. It is shown through simulation examples that in realistic block-fading channels, the MLyC with practical coded modulation outperforms the BICM without turbo receiver iteration.

At the extremes for over- and underestimation of SNR, the performance of BP tends to that of min-sum algorithm and the channel bit-error rate, respectively. Our results for regular codes indicate that the sensitivity to mismatch increases by increasing the variable-node degree and by decreasing the check-node degree. The effect of variable-node degree, however, appears to be more profound, such that at a given rate, the codes with the smallest variable and check degrees are more robust against SNR mismatch. For irregular codes, by comparing the thresholds of a few ensembles, we demonstrate that the ensemble which performs better in the absence of mismatch can perform worse in the presence of it. To obtain our asymptotic results, we propose a computationally efficient method based on the Gaussian approximation of density evolution in the presence of SNR mismatch. We also show that the asymptotic results are consistent with simulation results for codes with finite block lengths","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063517","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belief propagation","Decoding","Parity check codes","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Additive white noise","Bit error rate","Robustness","Gaussian approximation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel estimation","decoding","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief propagation algorithm","LDPC code decoding","channel estimation error","low-density parity-check codes","additive white Gaussian noise channel","channel signal-to-noise ratio","SNR mismatch","min-sum algorithm","channel bit-error rate","variable-node degree","check-node degree","irregular codes","Gaussian approximation","density evolution","finite block lengths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation (BP)","density evolution (DE)","Gaussian approximation (GA)","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","min-sum","signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation error","SNR mismatch","SNR threshold"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4063485/04063517.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.887488","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.887488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Belief Propagation for Decoding LDPC Codes in the Presence of Channel Estimation Error","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063517/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Belief Propagation for Decoding LDPC Codes in the Presence of Channel Estimation Error","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9258065","htmlLink":"/document/4063517/","volume":"55","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Belief Propagation for Decoding LDPC Codes in the Presence of Channel Estimation Error","sourcePdf":"55tcomm01-saeedi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064372S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4063485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4063485","articleId":"4063517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4063518,"authors":[{"name":"Amir John Salomon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Amir John","lastName":"Salomon","id":"37283909200"},{"name":"Ofer Amrani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Ofer","lastName":"Amrani","id":"37283119200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4063518","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Error correction codes","Product codes","Iterative decoding","Tensile stress","Modulation coding","Digital communication","Constellation diagram","Galois fields","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["product lattice construction","error-correcting codes","low-dimensional lattices","Kronecker product","bandwidth-limited channel","lattice codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Barnes\u2013Wall lattice","coset codes","lattice codes","Leech lattice","product codes"]}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the so-called product lattice (PL) construction.

Therefore, the asymptotic gain of DPC over time sharing for the sum rate is (M/min(M,N)) when M and N are fixed.

Simultaneous reduction in transmitter complexity and feedback overhead is proposed by imposing a diagonal structural constraint to precoding, i.e., power allocation. Minimum bit-error rate (MBER) is employed as the optimization criterion, and an approximate MBER (AMBER) power-allocation algorithm is proposed for a variety of receivers, including zero-forcing (ZF), successive interference cancellation (SIC), and ordered SIC (OSIC). While previously proposed precoding schemes either require ZF equalization for MBER, or use a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion, we provide a unified MBER solution to power allocation for ZF, SIC, and OSIC receiver structures. Improved error-rate performance is shown both analytically and by simulation. Simulation results also indicate that SIC and OSIC with AMBER power allocation offer superior performance over previously proposed MBER precoding with ZF equalization, as well as over MMSE precoding/decoding. Performance under noisy channels and power feedback is analyzed. A modified AMBER algorithm that mitigates error propagation in interference cancellation is developed.

The measurements are limited to time differences of arrival (TDOAs) of short-duration acoustic emissions, or transients, generated by the targets. This problem can arise in situations where the level of continuous broadband target-related noise is very low. Owing to the fact that transient emissions are nonstationary and can have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the corresponding TDOA measurement errors are usually non-Gaussian. Therefore, Gaussian mixture distributions are used to appropriately model these errors. An iterative maximum-likelihood optimization technique based on a modified deterministic annealing expectation-maximization (MDAEM) algorithm is applied to this problem. In each iteration, the algorithm uses a nonlinear least-squares (LS) technique in computing the motion parameters for each target. It generalizes the variance deflation method previously used for the initialization of target tracking algorithms and increases the possibility of attaining a globally optimal solution for random initial conditions. Simulation results are presented for several different numbers of targets, clutter densities, and probabilities of gross error of the target related measurements and are found to be comparable to the estimates obtained when the measurement-to-target assignments are exactly known","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.885745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4063528/04063534.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.885745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063528","startPage":"424","endPage":"436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Estimation of Multiple Target Positions and Velocities Using Passive TDOA Measurements of Transients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Estimation of Multiple Target Positions and Velocities Using Passive TDOA Measurements of Transients","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9329589","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4063534/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Estimation of Multiple Target Positions and Velocities Using Passive TDOA Measurements of Transients","sourcePdf":"55tsp02-carevic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082794S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4063528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4063528","articleId":"4063534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4063535,"authors":[{"name":"Li Chai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, VIC, Australia","Department of Automatic Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4063528/4063535/4063535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Chai (S'99\u2013M'02) received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering, both from Zhejiang University, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2002.","In May 2004, he joined Monash University, Australia, as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow.

Due to its nonlinearity, THP is more sensitive to errors in CSI at the transmitter than linear precoding, which may be large in wireless communications. Thus, THP performance degrades severely-and it is even outperformed by corresponding linear precoders. We propose a novel robust optimization for THP with partial CSI based on mean-square error (MSE), which performs a conditional mean (CM) estimate of the cost function including a novel model of the receivers. This enables a smooth transition of robust THP from complete, via partial, to statistical CSI. The performance is now always superior or in the worst case equal to corresponding linear precoding techniques.

When compared with the PEP of a traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, the \"diversity gain\" for the cooperative system is no longer just a simple exponential function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), rather, it involves the logarithm of the SNR. The term diversity gain function is used to designate this characteristic of the PEP. The coding gain, on the other hand, is found similar to that for the MIMO system and is proportional to the determinant of the autocorrelation of the error matrix. Based on our analysis and observations, we propose a design of unitary precoder for the cooperative system to achieve the full diversity gain function. For the case of a 4-QAM signal being transmitted, we further optimize the coding gain and arrive at a closed-form optimum precoder.

Simulation results also show that our method provides accurate and consistent frequency estimation results that other methods cannot provide with less or comparable computational complexity","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.885813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4063528/04063544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.885813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063528","startPage":"718","endPage":"724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Two-Dimensional Frequencies Using Modified Matrix Pencil Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Two-Dimensional Frequencies Using Modified Matrix Pencil Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9318083","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4063544/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Two-Dimensional Frequencies Using Modified Matrix Pencil Method","sourcePdf":"55tsp02-fchen-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059744S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4063528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4063528","articleId":"4063544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4063545,"authors":[{"name":"Lionel Fillatre","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4063528/4063545/4063545-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lionel Fillatre received the M.Sc. degree in decision and information engineering and the Ph.D. degree in systems optimization both from the University of Technology of Troyes (UTT), France, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","He joined the Signal and Communication Department of the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST) de Bretagne, France, in 2006, where he is currently Associate Professor.

An unknown scene is composed of a background, considered as a deterministic nuisance parameter, with a possibly hidden anomaly. Because the full pixel-by-pixel reconstruction is impossible, a parametric non-Bayesian approach is proposed to fill up the gap in the missing data. An optimal statistical test which eliminates the background and detects the anomaly is designed. The potential advantage of such an approach is its capacity to detect an anomaly/target hidden in background designed by an adversary to mask the anomaly. A key issue in the non-Bayesian anomaly detection, i.e., the problem of anomaly detectability, is stated and solved in this paper. In the case of a bivariate polynomial background defined on an unknown rectangular support, the size of detectable anomaly reaches its maximum defined by the number of elementary cells of X-ray detector and degree of the polynomial function","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4063528/04063545.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.885693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.885693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Bayesian Detection and Detectability of Anomalies From a Few Noisy Tomographic Projections","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","X-ray detectors","Computed tomography","Radiography","X-ray detection","Background noise","Polynomials","Object detection","Object recognition","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","image reconstruction","image resolution","object detection","polynomials","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non-Bayesian detection","anomalies detectability","noisy tomographic projections","deterministic nuisance parameter","pixel-by-pixel reconstruction","bivariate polynomial background","optimal statistical test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detectability","anomaly detection","computerized tomography","deterministic nuisance parameter","non-Bayesian parametric approach","optimal hypotheses testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Non-Bayesian Detection and Detectability of Anomalies From a Few Noisy Tomographic Projections","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4063545/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9329587","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Bayesian Detection and Detectability of Anomalies From a Few Noisy Tomographic Projections","sourcePdf":"55tsp02-fillatre.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101452S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4063528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4063528","articleId":"4063545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4063546,"authors":[{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"A.

This paper performs analysis and develops a solution for locating a moving source using time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements in the presence of random errors in receiver locations. The analysis starts with the Crameacuter-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the problem, and derives the increase in mean-square error (MSE) in source location estimate if the receiver locations are assumed correct but in fact have error.

The first algorithm uses a sinc interpolator whereas the second one uses a DFT-based interpolator. It is shown that the proposed algorithms are stable and the error due to noise and sampling jitter is bounded by the corresponding error norms of noise and jitter, respectively. We show that both of the block-based algorithms provide nearly perfect reconstruction for a class of practically time and bandlimited signals. Boundary effects are considered and single and multiblock processing is discussed. A modified block-based algorithm is developed by using the windowing technique in order to improve the mean-squared error (MSE) performance for nonbandlimited signals.

The genetic algorithm is used to find the segmentation points for deriving appropriate patterns. In the fitness evaluation, the proposed algorithm first divides subsequences in a chromosome into k clusters by using the k-means clustering approach.

The main reason is the image coefficients of RB-IWT based have smaller dynamic change value and worse energy compaction than those by the discrete wavelet transform. In this paper, the optimal scaling factor (OSF) is proposed for the RB-IWT. The OSF optimizes the coefficient distribution of the image subbands.

The main idea is to minimize the sum of the square errors between the amplitude response of the ideal FIR digital filter or digital differentiator and that of the designed by training the weight vector of neural networks, then obtaining the impulse response of FIR digital filter or differentiator. The convergence theorem of the neural-network algorithm is presented and proved, and the optimal design approach is introduced by examples of high-order FIR digital filter and digital differentiator. The results show that the high-order FIR digital filter or digital differentiator designed by training the weights of neural networks has a very high precision and very fast convergence speed, and initial weights are stochastic.

Utilizing the nonstationarity of speech, DBBF is implemented at the frequency bins of interest. In order to cope with the problem of channel swap, a rearranging operation is performed, based on the correlation coefficients between the frequency domain separated sequences of adjacent bins.

In order to resolve this problem, an adaptive algorithm (called FLMS in this paper) combined with decision feedback method is proposed. The simulations indicate that FLMS is able to resist the abrupt channel attenuation effectively.

Compared with the traditional algorithms where the linking strength of each neuron is the same and its value is chosen through experimentation, this algorithm uses the contrast of each pixel as its value, so that the linking strength of each pixel can be chosen adaptively. After the processing of PCNN with the adaptive linking strength, new fire mapping images are obtained for each image taking part in the fusion. The clear objects of each original image are decided by the compare-selection operator with the fire mapping images pixel by pixel and then all of them are merged into a new clear image. The compare-selection operator uses not only the fire time, but also the improved consistency check of the neighborhood of the certain pixel. Furthermore, by this algorithm, other parameters, for example, Delta, the threshold adjusting constant, only have a slight effect on the new fused image. Therefore, it overcomes the difficulty in adjusting parameters in PCNN.

In our case, the algorithm was applied to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. First, the basic structure of the algorithm was implemented and tested using plain C language and Matlab-generated OFDM samples for proof of concept reasons. Next, the code was ported on the DSP for implementation and optimization using DSP-specific C/assembly, and embodied into a previously implemented, in our lab, OFDM transceiver running on the DSP. The optimization scheme followed was based on several optimization aspects, such as identifying and recoding the most time-consuming parts utilizing the target hardware's characteristics, as well as algorithmic modifications and compiler features. The correctness of the optimization was continuously verified at every optimization stage by providing to the estimator actual data having passed through the transceiver.

The capacity can be further increased by feeding back channel state information to the transmitter and implementing antenna subset selection, especially for correlated channels. A fast and dynamic antenna subset selection algorithm is proposed in this paper, which has achieved the capacity near to the optimal selection algorithm, and avoided computing the capacity of all the antenna subset combinations.

It is therefore important to develop MIMO channel models which can provide accurate spatial correlation characteristics. This paper starts with the brief review of MIMO channel models and then concentrates on investigating the spatial correlation characteristics of the spatial channel model (SCM) in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the Kronecker based stochastic model (KBSM) at three levels, namely the cluster level, link level, and system level. The KBSM has the spatial separability at all the three levels. The SCM shows the spatial separability at the link and system levels, but not at the cluster level since its spatial correlation is related to the joint distribution of the angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). The KBSM with the Gaussian shaped power azimuth spectrum (PAS) is found to fit best the 3GPP SCM in terms of the spatial correlations. Despite of its simplicity and analytical tractability, the KBSM is restricted to model only the average spatial behavior of MIMO channels. The SCM provides more insights of the variations of different MIMO channel realizations but the implementation complexity is relatively high","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284744","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04063985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","startPage":"664","endPage":"669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling MIMO Fading Channels: Background, Comparison and Some Progress","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4063985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling MIMO Fading Channels: Background, Comparison and Some Progress","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4063985/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9319634","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4063985/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling MIMO Fading Channels: Background, Comparison and Some Progress","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044173S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4063985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4063986,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication College, China","Chongqing Communication Institute, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625700"},{"name":"Jianming Huang","affiliation":["XiDian University, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Huang","id":"38130531500"},{"name":"Zhiyong Shi","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication Institute, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Shi","id":"37291365000"},{"name":"Guixin Xuan","affiliation":["Chongqing Communication College, China","Chongqing Communication Institute, China"],"firstName":"Guixin","lastName":"Xuan","id":"37585944300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4063986","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel set of frequency hopping (FH) sequences which have few-hit zone (FHZ).

Therefore, only simple correlation operation is needed at the receiver to effectively resist interferences caused by multipath propagation effect, and maximum-ratio-combination (MRC) can be employed to further resist channel fading.

The simulation results show a significant advantage both for implementation complexity and for error rate performance under a fixed data rate","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284816","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04064057.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection in Spatial Correlated MIMO Systems with Correlation-Adapted Iterative Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064057/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection in Spatial Correlated MIMO Systems with Correlation-Adapted Iterative Receiver","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9330837","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4064057/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection in Spatial Correlated MIMO Systems with Correlation-Adapted Iterative Receiver","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083812S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4064057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4064059,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Lan","affiliation":["Department of Communication Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Lan","id":"38325748100"},{"name":"Wang Zong-xin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Science and Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Zong-xin","id":"38291722000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064059","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Finite impulse response filter","IIR filters","Wireless communication","Wiener filter","Algorithm design and analysis","Polynomials","Intersymbol interference","Communications technology","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","code division multiple access","IIR filters","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","radiocommunication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA wireless communication system","code division multiple access","inter-symbol interference","ISI suppression","adaptive IIR channel shortening algorithm","SIMO system","single input multiple output","virtual channel"]}],"abstract":"In high-speed CDMA wireless communication systems, inter-symbol interference may become serious because of the usage of spreading sequence with small spreading factor.

Furthermore, the spacing between pilot subcarriers in the frequency domain has to be close enough according to sampling theorem. To solve these problems, an DFT-based channel estimation using phase-shifted preambles in the frequency domain is proposed in this paper. At the receiver, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) of different channels can be easily distinguished in the time domain instead of in the frequency domain. Furthermore, the complete channel frequency responses (CFRs) including virtual subcarrier positions can be estimated by iterative method.

Based on the recursion of channel impulse response, the proposed channel tracking is essentially carried out in the time domain, which is referred as the time domain LMS scheme (TD-LMS). Since the number of channel taps in the time domain is much smaller than that of the frequency domain in a practical OFDM system, the time domain channel tracking may attain more accurate channel state information than the frequency domain. Moreover, the proposed TD-LMS scheme fully utilizes both the time and frequency domain correlation of the time-variant and frequency-selective channels.

In this paper, we propose and analyze a new envelop equalized processing (EEP), which makes the amplitude of the OFDM signal constant. Based on the proposed EEP, a novel self companding transform (SCT) is constructed to reduce the PAPR of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal.

Two OFDM symbols are designed for timing synchronization, of which the first is for coarse time synchronization and the second is for fine time synchronization. The user specific pilot signals are constructed in the whole obtained system band in the coarse timing preamble while the user exclusive subcarrier set in the fine timing preamble.

When treated separately, effective algorithms, such as the ICI self-cancellation scheme, exist for suppression of phase noise as well as IQ imbalance. However, with both effects present, such algorithms do not lead to effective suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to jointly combat the IQ imbalance and phase noise at baseband. An IQ imbalance estimation and compensation module, which is robust against phase noise, is added in the ICI self-cancellation based OFDM system. After the IQ imbalance has been compensated in the time domain, the ICI self-cancellation scheme of data-conjugate method is used to suppress the phase noise and the residual IQ imbalance. This scheme has a fast convergence and a nearly optimal BER performance even for large IQ imbalance in AWGN channel. In multipath channel, even for large IQ imbalance, this joint suppression scheme offers frequency diversity gain and as a result, the BER performance surpasses that of the conventional OFDM system without IQ imbalance and phase noise","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04064099.pdf","startPage":"1184","endPage":"1188","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Noise Suppression in OFDM systems in Presence of IQ Imbalance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","Bit error rate","Interference","Baseband","Phase estimation","Noise robustness","Convergence","AWGN channels","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise suppression","OFDM systems","IQ imbalance estimation","intercarrier interference","ICI self-cancellation scheme","time domain compensation module","data-conjugate method","bit error rate","BER","additive white Gaussian noise channels","multipath AWGN channel","frequency diversity gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Phase Noise Suppression in OFDM systems in Presence of IQ Imbalance","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4064099/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9330858","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Noise Suppression in OFDM systems in Presence of IQ Imbalance","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047834S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4064099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4064101,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China","School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37308021900"},{"name":"Yao Tianren","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Tianren","id":"37426299000"},{"name":"Wang Hui","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Hui","id":"38182296800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064101","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","WiMAX","OFDM","Filtering","Microwave technology","Hardware","Transmitters","Interchannel interference","Partial transmit sequences","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","filtering theory","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC algorithm","WiMAX system","worldwide interoperability-for-microwave access","802.16 standard","data transmission","broadband wireless access systems","clipping method","filtering method","OFDM signal calculation"]}],"abstract":"Worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) technology based on 802.16 standard support data transmission and high frequency efficiency.

This paper studies a new ICI self-cancellation scheme for combating the impact of ICI on OFDM systems. Its basic idea is that ICI components are canceled by using repeated symbols on time domain. At first, the two repeated symbol blocks on time domain, in which the 1st block is formed by inserting zero in the symbol block of a conventional OFDM system, and the 2nd block is formed by inversing and shifting cyclic right from the 1st block, are respectively transmitted at the transmitter. At the receiver, the received data symbols are divided into two paths corresponding to the two symbol blocks transmitted, and then the two data symbol streams are combined. Finally, the resultant symbol sequence is detected to obtain the estimation of original data symbols as a conventional OFDM system. By theoretical analysis and calculation for the new scheme, it is obviously shown that the ICI components contained in received signals can be effectively reduced, and the carrier-to-interference power ratio (CIR) of this scheme is at least 10 dB better than that of a conventional OFDM system. Meanwhile, comparing with other similar techniques, this new scheme is better than another similar scheme at normalized frequency offset epsiv>0.2. Consequently, this scheme can remarkably improve the performance of OFDM communication systems due to frequency offsets","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New ICI Self-Cancellation Scheme Based on Repeated Symbol in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284865","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04064106.pdf","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"A New ICI Self-Cancellation Scheme Based on Repeated Symbol in OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4064106/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9330864","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New ICI Self-Cancellation Scheme Based on Repeated Symbol in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054766S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4064106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4064107,"authors":[{"name":"Zhishui Sun","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhishui","lastName":"Sun","id":"38129588000"},{"name":"Changchuan Yin","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changchuan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37272677500"},{"name":"Guangxin Yue","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guangxin","lastName":"Yue","id":"37271317200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064107","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":986},"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is an attractive technique to implement multiuser diversity for the downlink.

However, this OFDM communication becomes poor because many overlapped time-domain signals produces the high PAPR (peak to average power ratio) and this causes the nonlinear distortion in the HPA (high power amplifier). In this paper, we propose a new TC-CI/OFDM (tone controlled carrier interferometry) to solve the high PAPR problem and apply the IMD (inter-modulation distortion) reduction techniques into this TC-CI/OFDM system in order to improve BER performance. PAPR can be reduced by adding the control tones in each OFDM symbol in the CI/OFDM system. So, TC-CI/OFDM system is more robust to the nonlinearity and IMD. The influences of the third-order term of the nonlinear input/output polynomial expression and the nonlinear HPA are studied by the theoretical and simulation analyses. It can be shown that TC-CI/OFDM system based on the IMD reduction is better than the same system based on PAPR reduction","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284870","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04064111.pdf","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IMD Anaysis-Based TC-CI/OFDM System for PAPR Reduction and BER Improvement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064111/","displayDocTitle":"IMD Anaysis-Based TC-CI/OFDM System for PAPR Reduction and BER Improvement","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9330867","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4064111/","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IMD Anaysis-Based TC-CI/OFDM System for PAPR Reduction and BER Improvement","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06788S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4064111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4064112,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Yu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37289439200"},{"name":"Chi-wah Kok","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-wah","lastName":"Kok","id":"37275220300"},{"name":"Gang Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064112","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Nonlinear distortion","Power amplifiers","Bit error rate","Power engineering and energy","Energy consumption","Power system modeling","Computational modeling","Portable computers","Personal digital assistants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficiency optimization","nonlinear distortion","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","power amplifier"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the tradeoff problem between power efficiency and nonlinear distortion of amplifiers in OFDM systems.

Energy consumption of the receiver in order to process each coded bit is considered as well as the wasted energy of a nonideal transmit amplifier. We consider the case where multiple simultaneous transmission can take place provided they sufficiently far apart (spatial reuse). The parameters we vary are the input power to the amplifier, the error control code rate and the transmission distance for each hop, or equivalently the number of hops between the source and destination. The result is a tradeoff between the energy efficiency and bandwidth efficiency of the network similar in nature to that found by Shannon for a single link. We consider the transport efficiency defined as the number of bits per second per Hz per Joule of energy to transport information reliably between a source and a destination node as a single network performance metric. The transport efficiency combines the bandwidth efficiency and energy efficiency into a single metric. The transport efficiency for the case of no spatial reuse decreases linearly with distance but if we allow large number of hops, with spatial reuse the transport efficiency approaches a floor that is independent of the path loss exponent. The minimum energy consumption as a function of distance increases linearly as a function of distance","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284882","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04064123.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy and Bandwidth Efficiency in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy and Bandwidth Efficiency in Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064123/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9330875","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4064123/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and Bandwidth Efficiency in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04527S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4064123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4064124,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37067204800"},{"name":"Shumei Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shumei","lastName":"Song","id":"37289036000"},{"name":"Ying Y.

Different from existing non-cross-layer methods, the algorithm makes allocation policy based on not only channel condition but also queue status of each user. The algorithm consists of two steps. Firstly, subcarriers are assigned to users under the proportional rate constraint and queue length constraint, assuming that the power is uniformly allocated on each subcarrier. In the second step, the overall power is allocated via a proposed proportional greedy algorithm, with the consideration of buffer state information as well, which can increase the power usage efficiency in some cases.

But it is well known that in practical CDMA networks, the received power at base station (BS) is usually hard to be maintained at a fixed threshold because of fading and path loss. Therefore putting forward the CAC schemes with imperfect power control for multimedia traffic will be great significant. In this paper, the system capacity with imperfect power control and the other-cell interference factor are analyzed.

Some applications, such as multimedia applications, can be served with varied bandwidth. To increase the total carried traffic in an overloaded wireless system, some of the ongoing connections can operate under the degraded model with lower quality-of-service (QoS). To satisfy the user QoS, we should compensate the connections degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel call admission control (CAC) scheme and develop a Markov model for the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme has service degradation and service compensation in CDMA cellular networks. In CAC, the proposed scheme degrades low priority connections to accommodate new connections. To decrease the drop probabilities of handoff connections, the proposed scheme gives handoff connections higher priority. To minimize the bandwidth loss of the connections, we propose the compensation model in scheduling that operates when the system has residual bandwidth.

However, the limited battery life and terminal size of the user equipment (UE) in a cellular system put a constraint on the performance enhancement by MIMO. Especially when the transmitter has more antenna than the receiver in downlink, the conventional MIMO schemes can only exploit partial multiplexing gain and diversity gain. For a multiuser system, multiuser diversity gain can be achieved by exploiting the independent frequency and spatial selective fading one another. In this paper, different multiuser multiple access schemes with greedy scheduling of MIMO OFDMA are investigated, e.g. TDMA, FDMA/TDMA and SDMA/FDMA/TDMA. For full spatial-frequency multiuser diversity gain and spatial multiplexing gain can be achieved, SDMA/FDMA/TDMA obtains highest spectrum efficiency. Its gain exceeds that of TDMA and FDMA/TDMA at least 80% and 40% respectively.

As the uniform spaced pilots in frequency domain are employed as the syndromes, and the space between the pilots is coprime with the number of the subcarriers, such an assignment of the pilots will possess an innate interleaving property.

Based on the level-crossing rate theory, a simple closed-form upper bound on the PAPR distribution of a band-limited OFDM signal is proposed. For the 16QAM-OFDM systems with different subcarrier number, the Monte Carlo simulation of the PAPR distribution is performed to test the tightness of the proposed upper bound. The simulation results show that the proposed upper bound matches the simulation results well when the subcarrier number is greater than or equal to 64. However, the upper bound is not tight when the subcarrier number is 32. In addition, instead of the actual PAPR being directly proportional to the subcarrier number, the research indicates that the probability that the PAPR is greater than a given value gamma is directly proportional to the subcarrier number N.

Recently, the performance of this rate control has been investigated in the literature by using simulation as a main tool for the study. However, no work in the literature validates the employed simulation by comparing simulation results to other methods such as analytical models. In fact, there is no analytical model of the probabilistic rate control in the literature. This paper investigates this analytical model and considers the number of mobile stations as an important external factor of the probabilistic rate control algorithms in the model. Simulation for a single cell scenario case is used to validate how accurate the proposed model is. The validation shows that the analytical model can provide the average throughput results closed to the simulation at various numbers of mobile stations","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4063962/04064147.pdf","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1423","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.284906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4063962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Model for Probabilistic Rate Control on a Reverse Link in CDMA2000-1x-EV-DO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Interference","Markov processes","Throughput","Member and Geographic Activities Board committees","Transmitters","Control systems","Broadcasting","Filling","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","radio links","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic rate control","CDMA2000-1x-EV-DO system","multirate mobile data services"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Model for Probabilistic Rate Control on a Reverse Link in CDMA2000-1x-EV-DO Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4064147/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"9330881","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Model for Probabilistic Rate Control on a Reverse Link in CDMA2000-1x-EV-DO Systems","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-2-185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069102S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4063962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4063962","articleId":"4064147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4064213,"authors":[{"name":"Li Min","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Min","id":"38357583900"},{"name":"Yu Shun-Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Shun-Zheng","id":"38276428400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064213","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Hidden Markov models","Traffic control","Intrusion detection","Probability distribution","Stochastic processes","Character recognition","Sun","Parameter estimation","Sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","hidden Markov models","parameter estimation","security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-wide traffic anomaly detection method","HSMM","hidden semiMarkov model","forward-backward algorithm","model parameters estimation","observed sequence","network-wide traffic distribution model","observation window","DoS flooding attacks","denial-of-service","normal background traffic"]}],"abstract":"Hidden semi-Markov model (HsMM) has been well studied and widely applied to many areas.

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) techniques have been proved to be quite effective in reducing both dynamic and static power consumption simultaneously. Thus, integrating processing elements (PEs) supporting DVS techniques into distributed embedded systems synthesis becomes an imperative way to make an energy-efficient design budget. In this paper, we propose a synthesis framework, which integrates task mapping, scheduling and voltage selection together to minimize energy consumption of distributed systems. Genetic algorithms based task mapping are deployed to do task mapping in the outer loop, which can maximize the energy saving possibilities. A nonlinear programming based optimal voltage selection engine is then used in the inner loop.

To meet these needs, a spatiotemporal chaotic map is digitized to develop a highly paralleled PRBS generator that accommodates to FPGA (field programmable gate array) implementation in present paper. Certain interleaving and truncating processes are introduced into the PRBS generator to avoid the degradation due to digitization. Owing to the exceptional properties of spatiotemporal chaos like the sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters, the mixing and ergodicity characters, and the intrinsic feature of operational parallelism, the proposed PRBS generator not only has good performance in terms of statistical properties, but also has high product throughput being realized by FPGA hardware. The PRBS generator has successfully passed several performance assessments including widely used FIPS 140-2 test and extremely rigorous NIST 800-22 test. An effort of integrating the proposed algorithm into a Xilinx Spartan-III XC3S400 FPGA is also reported.

Stationary sensors' detecting precision is high. But because stationary sensors only can detect point information of links, stationary sensors' maturity degree is bad. On account of mobile sensors' detecting links' livelong transportation information, mobile sensors' maturity degree is high. However because of GPS data's errors and probe vehicles' randomness mobile sensors' detecting precision is bad.

The model consists of three modules: (1) mobile detecting module which measure first part, second part and third part travel time over a link using taxis equipped with differential global positioning system receivers; (2) loop detecting module which measure travel time using fixed detectors fixed in roads and traffic signal timing parameters; and (3) data fusion module which uses a neural network to combine outputs from the above two modules to improve the travel time estimation accuracy. This model's inputs respectively are: travel time detected by mobile sensors, travel time detected by stationary sensors, mobile sensors' density in the link and stationary sensors' density in the link. This model's output is the link's travel time. To validate the validity of this model, this paper presents the test of this model using a great deal of real data in Guangzhou city.

Spectral density is also critical to extend the effective bandwidth of a wireless transmitter, which is why linear PAs are popular, in spite of their inherently low power efficiency levels. An asynchronous power-tracking scheme is therefore proposed to more efficiently power-condition the supply of linear RF PAs and extend overall battery life performance. The RF supply is comprised of a high power but slow-responding voltage regulator with a lower power but fast-responding parallel nonlinear clamping circuit. Simulations with a SiGe HBT class-A RF PA show that the proposed circuit consumes 10-15% less total power and achieves 1.5% better overall power efficiency than the state-of-the-art power-tracking scheme while meeting the same error-vector magnitude (EVM) performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064437/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"10311658","publicationDate":"June 2006","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4064437/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Nonlinear Power-Tracking Supply for Power Efficient Linear RF PAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Nonlinear Power-Tracking Supply for Power Efficient Linear RF PAs","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-4-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084563S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4064335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4064335","articleId":"4064437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4064441,"authors":[{"name":"He Guanghui","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Guanghui","id":"37418853200"},{"name":"Yu Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37423619100"},{"name":"Zhou Zucheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Zucheng","id":"37373863300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9584-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9585-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064441","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064441","abstract":"V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Lab Layered Space-Time) wireless systems are multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes which can achieve very high spectral efficiency in scattering environments.

A family of isolated ZVS active clamp converter is introduced. The technique of the adopted ZVS commutation will not increase additional voltage stress of switching devices. In the adopted converter with series-connected transformer, each transformer can be operated as an inductor or a transformer. Therefore no output inductor is needed. To reduce the voltage stress of switching device in the conventional forward converter, active clamp technique is used to recycle the energy stored in the transformer leakage back into the input dc source. During the transition interval between two active switches, the resonant behavior based on the output capacitance of switches and transformer leakage inductance will turn on the body diode of switches. The operation principles, steady state analysis and design equations of the adopted converter are provided.

When the aperture, the number of elements and the minimum element spacing are fixed identical, the new approach can make the sparse plane array produce lower peak sidelobe level (PSLL). The simulated results show that the fitness function value of thinned plane arrays with 108 elements mentioned by Haupt can reduce 5.626dB when the minimum element spacing of half wavelength was introduced into the optimization. And as well, the great efficiency and the robustness of IGA are shown in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.285245","startPage":"2781","endPage":"2785","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCAS.2006.285245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4064335","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4063797/4064335/04064492.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Sparse Plane Arrays Using an Improved Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064492/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Sparse Plane Arrays Using an Improved Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4064492/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10291302","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Sparse Plane Arrays Using an Improved Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCAS-4-157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082135S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4063797","isNumber":"4064335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4063797","xplore-issue":"4064335","articleId":"4064492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4064510,"authors":[{"name":"Effrosyni Kokiopoulou","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Federale deLausanne, Signal Processing Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Effrosyni","lastName":"Kokiopoulou","id":"37294899000"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Federale deLausanne, Signal Processing Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9752-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9751-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064510","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Face recognition","Gabor filters","Image sampling","Feature extraction","Image recognition","Cost function","Signal sampling","Frequency","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image classification","image sampling","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","sampling problem","supervised feature selection problem","classification task","face recognition operation","random filter","Gabor wavelet filter","high frequency component"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064510","abstract":"Feature extraction based on different types of signal filters has received a lot of attention in the context of face recognition. It generally results into extremely high dimensional feature vectors, and sampling of the coefficients is required to reduce their dimensionality. Unfortunately, uniform sampling that is commonly used to that aim, does not consider the specificities of the recognition task in selecting the most relevant features. In this paper, we propose to formulate the sampling problem as a supervised feature selection problem where features are carefully selected according to a well defined discrimination criterion. The sampling process becomes specific to the classification task, and further facilitates the face recognition operations. We propose to build features on random filters, and Gabor wavelets, since they present interesting characteristics in terms of discrimination, due to their high frequency components. Experimental results show that the proposed feature selection method outperforms uniform sampling, and that random filters are very competitive with the common Gabor wavelet filters for face recognition tasks","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2006.285260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2006.285260","startPage":"20","endPage":"23","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4064504/4064505/04064510.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4064505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification-Specific Feature Sampling for Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Classification-Specific Feature Sampling for Face Recognition","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4064510/","accessionNumber":"9287039","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064510/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification-Specific Feature Sampling for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"MMSP-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059388S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4064504","isNumber":"4064505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4064504","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4064505","articleId":"4064510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4064523,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong He","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"He","id":"37697044500"},{"name":"Li Deng","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Deng","id":"37271500200"},{"name":"Wu Chou","affiliation":["Avaya Laboratories Research, Basking Ridge, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Chou","id":"37273276200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9752-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9751-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064523","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Hidden Markov models","Speech processing","Speech recognition","Large-scale systems","Pattern recognition","Vocabulary","Mutual information","Parameter estimation","Solids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","parameter estimation","pattern classification","speech processing","speech recognition","training","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","HMM","speech processing","audio processing","discriminative learning technique","speech recognition","optimization technique","minimum classification error","MCE","maximum mutual information training","extended Baum-Welch","EBW algorithm","parameter estimation","pattern recognition application","vocabulary task"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speech recognition and audio processing","pattern recogntion","machine learning","discriminative learning","hidden Markov model","rational-function optimization","growth transformation","extended Baum-Welch algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, various discriminative learning techniques for HMMs have consistently yielded significant benefits in speech recognition. In this paper, we present a novel optimization technique using the minimum classification error (MCE) criterion to optimize the HMM parameters. Unlike maximum mutual information training where an extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm exists to optimize its objective function, for MCE training the original EBW algorithm cannot be directly applied. In this work, we extend the original EBW algorithm and derive a novel method for MCE-based model parameter estimation. Compared with conventional gradient descent methods for MCE learning, the proposed method gives a solid theoretical basis, stable convergence, and it is well suited for the large-scale batch-mode training process essential in large-scale speech recognition and other pattern recognition applications. Evaluation experiments, including model training and speech recognition, are reported on both a small vocabulary task (TI-digits) and a large vocabulary task (WSJ), where the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.

The wavelet-based image interpolation approach has good potential in producing interpolated images with high quality edges. Using the wavelet multiresolution analysis theory, such method is computationally demanding. In this paper, a new edge-based image interpolation method that uses symmetric biorthogonal wavelet transform is proposed. We form a list of ideal step edges and study the relationships between the wavelet approximation sub-image of each edge and its wavelet detail sub-images. Based on these relationships, a simple and efficient algorithm that predicts the edge information of high resolution images is proposed. For this method, the 9/7-M inverse wavelet transform is shown, experimentally, to yield better image interpolation performance compared to traditional image interpolation approaches","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4064504/4064505/04064579.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2006.285329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2006.285329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4064505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Edge-based Image Interpolation Approach Using Symmetric Biorthogonal Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Wavelet transforms","Multiresolution analysis","Image resolution","Wavelet analysis","Humans","Prediction algorithms","Time domain analysis","Image processing","Multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","interpolation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge-based image interpolation","symmetric biorthogonal wavelet transform","human vision"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge-based image interpolation","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Edge-based Image Interpolation Approach Using Symmetric Biorthogonal Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4064579/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9287108","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Edge-based Image Interpolation Approach Using Symmetric Biorthogonal Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"MMSP-00-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06486S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4064504","isNumber":"4064505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4064504","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4064505","articleId":"4064579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4064581,"authors":[{"name":"Xixin Cao","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xixin","lastName":"Cao","id":"37290376700"},{"name":"Qingqing Xie","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingqing","lastName":"Xie","id":"37288018100"},{"name":"Chungan Peng","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chungan","lastName":"Peng","id":"37291375100"},{"name":"Qingchun Wang","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingchun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38127756400"},{"name":"Dunshan Yu","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dunshan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37290255400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9752-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9751-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4064581","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient VLSI Implementation of Distributed Architecture for DWT","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4064504/4064505/04064581.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2006.285331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4064505","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2006.285331","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Discrete wavelet transforms","Arithmetic","Computer architecture","Application software","Hardware","Filter bank","Transform coding","MPEG 4 Standard","Read only memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI implementation","distributed architecture","DWT","discrete wavelet transform","coefficient matrix","image compression systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Arithmetic","JPEG2000","MPEG4","DWT","VLSI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4064581","abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient and simple architecture for 9/7 discrete wavelet transform based on distributed arithmetic.

For one, the lack of quality of service (QoS) guarantees in existing networks such as the Internet means that time-constrained media packets will face dynamic variations in bandwidth, loss rate, and delay as they traverse the network from the sender to the receiver. The variable rate of media traffic represents yet another difficulty when transmission constraints need to be met. Finally, the heterogeneity of client devices and access bandwidth coupled with custom user preferences exacerbate the problem of smooth and quality-optimized media playback even further. In this article we provide an overview of the various techniques for media and streaming strategy adaptation, which can be employed to deal with the difficulties imposed by such dynamic environments. These techniques depend on the characteristics of the media application, in particular on the network streaming infrastructure and the timing constraints imposed on the media packets' delivery. We survey adaptation techniques that act on the encoding of the multimedia information, on the scheduling of the media packets, or that try to combat transmission errors. We also briefly overview some media-friendly networking solutions, which contribute to increased QoS by incorporating some level of intelligence in intermediate network nodes. Finally, we describe a few open challenges in media streaming, emphasizing strategies based on promising cross-layer approaches where adaptation strategies are applied in a coordinated manner, across different layers of the network protocol stack","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4064628/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4064628/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9325806","volume":"45","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive systems for improved media streaming experience","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive systems for improved media streaming experience","sourcePdf":"CHAKARESKI.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052056S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"4064613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4064613","articleId":"4064628","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4064632,"authors":[{"name":"Bhaskaran Raman","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"p":["Kameswari Chebrolu (chebrolu@iitk.ac.in) is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.

We begin by analyzing the main strengths of CDMA450, but also some of the potential limitations for rural coverage, from both a technical and an economic standpoint. We argue that CDMA450 is a promising technology, competitive in both capacity-centric urban environments and in coverage-centric rural environments. Consequently, we discuss the opportunities of providing universal coverage by adopting a business model targeting both urban and rural deployments, and utilizing urban to rural cross-subsidization. We then explore the advantages of deploying CDMA450 using a fixed wireless (WLL) model. To this end, we explore the effective range of WLL CDMA450, and the impact of using directional antennas and receive antenna diversity in real-world commercial CDMA450 deployment in Romania.

This mode has a monopolar radiation pattern with a null in the zenith, in contrast with the radiation patterns of fundamental mode for circular and ring patches (the TM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>\n mode) that are broadside. The lack of a good characterization of this geometry motivates the present work. In it, an exhaustive study of SCRP antennas via simulations has been performed. The dependence between the fundamental antenna parameters: the internal radius (r), the external radius (R), the permittivity of the substrate (epsi) and its thickness (h); has been studied.

At many tasks, such as the solution of systems of linear equations, these machines are thousands of times as fast as human beings. However, they are relatively inept at solving many problems where the data is arranged naturally in a spatial form. For example, when it comes to playing chess or recognizing sophisticated patterns, present day machines cannot match the performance of their designers. The difficulty in such cases appears to be that conventional computers can actively cope with only a small amount of information at any one time. (This circumstance is aptly illustrated by the title of an article by Samuel, \"Computing Bit by Bit.\") It appears that efficient handling of problems of the type mentioned above cannot be accomplished without some form of parallel action. A stored program computer is described which can handle spatial problems by operating directly on information in planar form without scanning or using other techniques for transforming the problem into some other domain. The order structure of this machine is explained and illustrated by a few simple programs. An estimate of the size of the computer (based on one possible design) is given. Programs have been written that enable the machine to recognize alphabetic characters independent of position, proportion, and size.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1958.286755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065272","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1750","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065272/04065286.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computer Oriented toward Spatial Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1958","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1958","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Computer Oriented toward Spatial Problems","publicationDate":"Oct. 1958","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computer Oriented toward Spatial Problems","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v46-n10-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034513S","chronDate":"Oct.  1958","isNumber":"4065272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"165","articleId":"4065286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4065320,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It also describes briefly practical accomplishments with germanium diffused base transistors of the type reported by Lee. Finally, the frequency limitations of the junction triode are compared with those of the field effect transistor and the analog transistor. For transistors of the mesa type with linear emitter and base electrodes (i.e., an emitter stripe with parallel base contact stripes a fraction of the emitter width distant on each side), the (power gain)\u00bd(bandwidth) product is found to be about 7.5 \u00d7 106/s cps where s is emitter stripe width in centimeters. This is an order of magnitude better than the corresponding figures for field effect and analog transistors. For operation at or below the alpha cutoff fre quency, the gain-band product is shown to be nearly independent of the particular alpha cutoff frequency selected. This independence arises from the reciprocity between collector depletion layer capaci tance per unit area and collector depletion layer transit time. This transit time effectively determines alpha cutoff frequency in optimunm gain-band designs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Immune system","Capacitance","Contact resistance","Delay effects","Transistors","Electrodes","Cutoff frequency","Performance gain","Frequency response","Impurities"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1958.286811","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065313/04065320.pdf","startPage":"1924","endPage":"1927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1958.286811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structure-Determined Gain-Band Product of Junction Triode Transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4065320","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Structure-Determined Gain-Band Product of Junction Triode Transistors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065320/","volume":"46","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1958","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1958","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1958","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure-Determined Gain-Band Product of Junction Triode Transistors","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v46-n12-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027169S","chronDate":"Dec.  1958","isNumber":"4065313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"73","articleId":"4065320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4065360,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By coding the Mark-Space sequence of symbols to be transmitted into a wide-band signal, it becomes possible at the receiver to isolate those portions of the transmitted signal arriving with different delays, using correlation detection techniques. Before being recombined by addition, these separated signals are continuously and automatically processed so as to 1) apply to each an optimum weighting coefficient, derived from a measurement of the ionosphere response, and 2) introduce in each an appropriate delay such that they are all brought back into time coincidence. After a brief introduction, a functional description of the system is presented. There follows a review of the communication theory studies, which indicate that such systems have certain optimal properties. Details of design of an experimental prototype Rake system are followed by the results of limited field tests of this prototype.

Amplification of signal power in the form of growing waves is obtained in a propagating structure which is partially or totally embedded in a ferromagnetic medium. The structure, in one of its possible forms, possesses two propagating modes: one of the modes is excited by a signal at the input end, and the other is used as an idling circuit. The structure should also support a traveling wave supplied by a local oscillator which provides, through the motion of the magnetization, a time-varying coupling between the two propagating modes. The problem is essentially that of two coupled transmission lines with a time-dependent coupling coefficient. Optimum conditions for amplification are derived.

In such a beam the two normal space charge waves at the signal frequency break into two parts-one grows exponentially with distance and the second is attenuated. Either the \"slow\" or the \"fast\" space charge wave can be amplified. When this beam, which has been previously modulated at the double frequency, is coupled to a slow wave circuit, growing waves are found and again the \"fast\" space charge wave can be amplified.

In general, the bandwidth of all of these devices approaches zero as the nonlinearity approaches zero. Three cases are considered; f1 is the local oscillator frequency. 1) Noninverting modulator and demodulator-signal frequencies fl and f+=f1+fl. This device is stable and yields maximum gain with matched source and load. Under matched conditions the gain is equal to the ratio of output to input frequency; for widely separated signal frequencies the modulator has substantial gain, the demodulator an equal loss. Only a relatively small amount of nonlinearity is required to attain a bandwidth equal to the low-signal frequency. Since source and load are matched the sensitivity is zero. 2) Inverting modulator and demodulator-signal frequencies fl and f-=f1-fl.

Transient cases for large trap density are presented.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1958.286837","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065428/04065438.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1958.286837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065428","startPage":"973","endPage":"990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrons, Holes, and Traps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4065438","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrons, Holes, and Traps","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1958","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1958","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1958","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrons, Holes, and Traps","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v46-n6-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033297S","chronDate":"June  1958","isNumber":"4065428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"64","articleId":"4065438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4065442,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In a p-n-p-n structure relying upon an electric field to increase one internal alpha sufficiently to produce switching, the \"turn-on\" current is related to minority-carrier lifetime (diffusion length) and to the resistivity, area, and base width of the section depending upon field transport. It is shown that at least one base region can be of relatively large dimension. This increases \"turn-on\" current, \"on\" impedance, and \"turn-off\" time, but allows greater freedom in some aspects of device design and fabrication at not a great increase of the characteristics mentioned. In particular, two and three terminal p-n-p-n switches, dependent in part upon field transport, can be designed as signal devices or as power devices.

It removes difficulties heretofore associated with the effect of feedback upon spot noise performance. This measure, (Me)opt, is a function of the amplifier noise and circuit parameters alone. It determines the lowest spot noise figure achievable at high gain with a given amplifier, which is used either alone or in a passive interconnection with other amplifiers of the same (Me)opt. Moreover, passive interconnection of amplifiers with different (Me)opt cannot lead to a spot noise figure at high gain better than that obtainable by using only amplifiers of the smallest (Me)opt. (Me)opt is, therefore, a valid measure of the absolute quality of amplifier noise performance. In many important cases the best noise performance attainable with a particular type of amplifier is actually achieved by a simple cascade in which the input of each stage is properly mismatched. The mismatch conditions for each stage do not in general coincide with those normally used to \"minimize\" its noise figure. In the case of a two-terminal-pair negative resistance amplifier, a limiting form of which is the maser, optimization may always be obtained using an ideal circulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1958","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1958","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1958","volume":"46","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Noise Performance of Linear Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Noise Performance of Linear Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v46-n8-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028664S","chronDate":"Aug.  1958","isNumber":"4065509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"73","articleId":"4065518","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4065535,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287207","startPage":"1940","endPage":"1951","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065591/04065609.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1959","displayDocTitle":"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 1959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v47-n11-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027806S","chronDate":"Nov.  1959","isNumber":"4065591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"570","articleId":"4065609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4065638,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The emitter-collector charge transit time is shown to be a ubiquitous physical parameter determining current, voltage, and power amplifications and their bandwidth products. Also of central importance is a characteristic capacitance that describes the capability of the inter-electrode space to store mobile charge. The unipolar and analog transistors, the grid-controlled vacuum tube, and the beam deflection tube all have characteristic capacitances approximately equal to their electrode geometrical capacitances. The bipolar transistor holds an advantage over the other solid-state devices because it can have a larger characteristic capacitance. This advantage also holds against the vacuum tube devices, but is tempered by the fact that the latter can have much larger carrier drift velocities. For the solid-state devices it is emphasized that the saturated carrier drift velocity is sometimes a better indication of material merit than carrier mobility. Ultra-high frequency performance of the solid-state devices requires some combination of microscopic dimensions, improved materials, or charge multiplication.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Electron tubes","Capacitance-voltage characteristics","Electron mobility","Motion control","Voltage","Bandwidth","Space charge","Electrodes","Capacitance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287176","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065682/04065689.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple General Analysis of Amplifier Devices with Emritter, Control, and Collector Functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4065689","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simple General Analysis of Amplifier Devices with Emritter, Control, and Collector Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065689/","volume":"47","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1959","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple General Analysis of Amplifier Devices with Emritter, Control, and Collector Functions","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v47-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021615S","chronDate":"March  1959","isNumber":"4065682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4065689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4065705,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This means, in terms of Pierce's traveling-wave tube theory, that the growth constant of the growing wave x1 is zero in this regime of operation. A theory explaining this phenomenon has been worked out and both small-signal and large-signal calculations have been carried out to investigate the characteristics of this type of operation. The gain occurs in this region due to a beating effect produced between the three small-signal forward waves described in traveling-wave tube theory as they travel along the RF structure. The maximum achievable gain is determined by the injection velocity and not by the length of the tube as in the normal case. Based on the above theory a device named the Crestatron, which utilizes this new mode of operation, has been built and tested to verify the theory, and it has been found that moderate gain (10-20 db) and high operating efficiency coupled with a very short length (4-6 wave-lengths) characterize this mode of operation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Radio frequency","Circuits","Gain measurement","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Testing","Current measurement","Velocity measurement","Wavelength measurement","Radiofrequency interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287335","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065701/04065708.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of the Crestatron: A Forward-Wave Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4065708","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theory of the Crestatron: A Forward-Wave Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065708/","volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1959","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of the Crestatron: A Forward-Wave Amplifier","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v47-n4-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044606S","chronDate":"April  1959","isNumber":"4065701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4065708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4065741,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The distance measurement is accomplished by correlating the modulation on the transmitted and received signals. The spectrum of the modulating function determines the way in which this correlation, and hence system output, depends on distance to a reflecting target. Physical realizability of filters limits the output-to-distance behavior of linear, noise-modulated systems. Theoretically, either amplitude or frequency modulation can be used, but the latter has distinct advantages in overcoming incidental spurious signals generated within the system. Actual multiplication of signals is avoided through use of a conventional mixer. The resulting system is similar to existing altimeters but is free of the ambiguities inherent in periodically modulated systems, avoids the \"fixed error,\" and is capable of measuring distances down to a few feet.

The exposition specifically omits discussion of the decision problem and the statistical nature of the whole process of detection. The theory assumes that the received signal is processed by cross correlation with a normalized replica of the expected signal. The problem of echo to noise is analyzed by sampling theory leading, in the case of Gaussian noise, to the energy principle which states that in all cases the output echo-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the input signal energy to the input noise power spectrum density. The threshold effect in detection is briefly discussed in conjunction with the problem of noise ambiguities. The problem of echo to reverberation (clutter) is treated by the use of the time and frequency shift correlation function leading to the ambiguity diagrams for various waveforms. The calculation of the relative reverberation power for short and long pulses of single frequency, FM and pseudorandom or noise-like waveforms for certain special cases is presented to illustrate the application of these principles. The paper concludes with a discussion of some limitations to the theory in terms of its narrow-band approximation, the instability of platforms and medium, and combined space-time ambiguities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1959","volume":"47","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1959","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Theory of Active Sonar Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theory of Active Sonar Detection","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v47-n5-28.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034895S","chronDate":"May  1959","isNumber":"4065721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"44","articleId":"4065749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4065786,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The principal results are given in graphs and tables, useful in system design.

Between two such dipoles, the far mutual impedance is that of mutual inductance, expressed in terms of space properties and the radiansphere.

A simple approximate formula makes possible the computation of center-frequency loss in terms of bandwidth, unloaded Q of the resonators, and the parameters of the prototype filter. It is shown how the insertion loss elsewhere in the pass band and stop band may be computed from the prototype filter after modifying its circuit to take account of dissipation in the resonators. The computational techniques are used to compare several symmetrical designs with each other and with unsymmetrical designs having exact maximally-flat and equal-ripple response in the presence of dissipation. It is found that the symmetrical designs offer lower pass-band loss than the unsymmetrical designs. It is proven that a symmetrical filter based on an equal-element prototype has minimum-possible center-frequency loss for given unloaded Q and stop-band bandwidth, subject to assumptions that the loss per resonator is small and that the stop-band insertion loss may be determined accurately from the highest-power term of the insertion-loss polynomial.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065821","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1348","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065821/04065831.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dissipation Loss in Multiple-Coupled-Resonator Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1959","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dissipation Loss in Multiple-Coupled-Resonator Filters","publicationDate":"Aug. 1959","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dissipation Loss in Multiple-Coupled-Resonator Filters","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v47-n8-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02557S","chronDate":"Aug.  1959","isNumber":"4065821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"94","articleId":"4065831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4065870,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Since the amplitude distribution of the composite signal for a large number of channels is essentially Gaussian, the crosstalk can be calculated with reasonable accuracy by assuming that the input signal is random noise, except for a narrow gap in which a sine wave is inserted to represent the signal in a selected channel. This assumption allows use of standard analytical techniques to determine the output signal-to-crosstalk ratio in the selected channel as a function of the clipping level. The resulting value for infinite clipping is about 9 db. The crosstalk decreases rapidly as the clipping level is raised, and a value of 40 db is obtained for clipping one per cent of time. An optimum clipping level, which provides the highest signal-to-total-interference ratio, may be determined when noise is present in the receiver, and allows definition of \"peak factor allowance.\" An allowance of several db is found to be adequate for frequency-multiplexed binary data channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1960","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1960","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk Due to Finite Limiting of Frequency-Multiplexed Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk Due to Finite Limiting of Frequency-Multiplexed Signals","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n1-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021958S","chronDate":"Jan.  1960","isNumber":"4065901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4065914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4065915,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-8390"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6634"}],"articleNumber":"4065915","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":39,"totalDownloads":496},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement standards","Noise measurement","Crosstalk","Gaussian noise","Noise level","Communication system signaling","Noise reduction","Power measurement","Power engineering and energy","Personnel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287380","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04065915.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065901/04065915.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065901","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287380","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","startPage":"60","endPage":"68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IRE Standards on Methods of Measuring Noise in Linear Twoports, 1959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4065915","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1960","displayDocTitle":"IRE Standards on Methods of Measuring Noise in Linear Twoports, 1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065915/","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1960","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IRE Standards on Methods of Measuring Noise in Linear Twoports, 1959","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n1-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029318S","chronDate":"Jan.  1960","isNumber":"4065901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"105","articleId":"4065915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4065919,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Assuming that a suitable beam shape and sidelobe level in the broadside direction have been attained, it is shown how scanning of the array through introduction of a phase delay into the wave front distorts this pattern and introduces new sidelobes. The study uses contour maps of the antenna pattern in \"sin \u03b8-space,\" which is a projection of the unit sphere on the plane of the array. In this space the antenna pattem remains invariant with scan angle and merely undergoes a translation proportional to the phase delay between adjacent radiators. Using a parallel projection of the unit sphere onto the plane of the array, the actual antenna pattems are then readily obtained in conventional spherical coordinates. This method also permits ready evaluation of the influence of the directivity of the radiating elements, including a slight shift of the beam maximum with respect to that of an array of isotropic radiators. Furthermore, a pictorial representation of the coverage of a tilted planar array of given scanning properties can be obtained in terms of an earth-fixed coordinate systerr. Finally, it is shown how the beam-pointing error in a phased array is related to systematic errors in the phase delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065932/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1960","volume":"48","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1960","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Properties of Phased Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties of Phased Arrays","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n10-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052817S","chronDate":"Oct.  1960","isNumber":"4065926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"83","articleId":"4065932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4065975,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This type of amplifier is particularly suited to microwave frequencies and incorporates new features that overcome some severe difficulties associated with other circuit structures. Traveling-wave diode-type amplifiers having relatively wide bandwidths and great simplicity at S band have already resulted from this approach (details of experiments will be described in Part II). An analysis is presented which provides detailed information on operating characteristics, including the effects of terminal impedances, reflected waves, circuit loss, etc., and also leads to a simple physical picture of the cumulative interaction mechanism in terms of coupled-mode concepts. This physical picture is emphasized throughout this paper. Gain bandwidth considerations are discussed in terms of a fundamental \"interaction-impedance\" parameter. Representative calculated curves show that unilateral gains of 12 to 15 db over relatively wide bandwidths are attainable with as few as 4 to 6 diodes. Methods of increasing the gain through use of ferrites and special circuit techniques are proposed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coupling circuits","Bandwidth","Diodes","Microwave filters","Microwave amplifiers","Microwave frequencies","Microwave circuits","Information analysis","Impedance","Ferrites"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287564","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4065970/04065975.pdf","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4065970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled-Cavity Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers: Part I-Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4065975","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coupled-Cavity Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers: Part I-Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065975/","volume":"48","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1960","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1960","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled-Cavity Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers: Part I-Analysis","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n12-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034559S","chronDate":"Dec.  1960","isNumber":"4065970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"16","articleId":"4065975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4065993,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The balun is an impedance matching transition from coaxial line to a balanced, two-conductor line. The transition is accomplished by cutting open the outer wall of the coax so that a cross-sectional view shows a sector of the outer conductor removed. As one progresses along the balun from the coaxial end, the open sector varies from zero to almost 2\u03c0, yielding the transition to a two-conductor line. The balun impedance is tapered so that the input reflection coefficient follows a Tchebycheff response in the pass band. To synthesize the impedance taper, the impedance of a slotted coaxial line was obtained by means of a variational solution which yielded upper and lower bounds to the exact impedance. Slotted line impedance was determined experimentally by painting the line cross section on resistance card using silver paint and measuring the dc resistance of the section. The measured VSWR of a test balun did not exceed 1.25:1 over a 50:1 bandwidth. Dissipative loss was less than 0.1 db over most of the range. Measurements show that the unbalanced current at the output terminals is negligible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4065993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1960","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1960","volume":"48","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 1960","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"100:1 Bandwidth Balun Transformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"100:1 Bandwidth Balun Transformer","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n2-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043099S","chronDate":"Feb.  1960","isNumber":"4065988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"98","articleId":"4065993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4065996,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is concluded that the considerable advantages of integrated devices, compared to conventional devices, such as very small volume and weight, and reduced number of metallic connections, have to be paid for by higher shrinkage in fabrication. Three considerations are advanced, which will reduce partially this higher shrinkage. First, the resulting increase in cost may be made very small if the design of the integrated device allows the extent of integration to be adjusted to the shrinkage rate. Second, the resultant high cost of the integrated device justifies a higher investment in the fabrication process of the integrated devices than for the individual units.

The technique of pulse compression offers a means of increasing the average power available to illuminate radar targets without any loss at the receiver of the resolution needed for the tactical requirements of the system. This is accomplished by transmitting a wide pulse in which the carrier is frequency modulated and then, by proper signal processing methods, causing a time compression of the received signal to a much narrower pulse of high effective peak power. The spectra and time functions of a particular class of pulse compression signals are analyzed and the basis for compression filter design is derived.

This combination of high power output and broadband performance represents a significant advance in the millimeter art. The electrical and mechanical techniques are described which were found successful in solving the problems peculiar to the high operating frequency. These problems are focusing, heat dissipation, intrinsic RF loss and structural precision. Experimental data on an operating tube are presented which show good agreement with predicted performance.

Such possibilities are: heavier p-layer doping; change of geometry, possibly by application of grid structures; improvement of the material constants; and utilization of drift fields for improved collection. Discussed are materials other than silicon in regard to their potential for better performance than that obtainable from the silicon solar cell; and finally, new methods of approach, such as the multilayer and the multiple transition solar cell. Both of these methods yield theoretically large improvements, but realization depends on further advances in compound semiconductor technology and in knowledge about localized centers in the forbidden gap. Limit conversion efficiencies of 38.2 per cent for a 3-layer cell and of 51 per cent for a 3-transition cell, compared to 23.6 per cent for a single p-n junction, single transition cell, are obtained.

During sustained oscillation, noise creates undesired perturbations or modulation in both the amplitude and the phase of the wave. The amplitude perturbations produce a continuous spectrum which in typical situations is quite weak and broader than the bandwidth of the resonator. The phase perturbations disperse the nominal frequency into a continuous distribution which is of the same form but much stronger and narrower than for the amplitude perturbations. During the initiation of oscillation, noise constitutes the starting voltage and therefore affects the time required for the wave to reach some pre-established amplitude. The resulting jitter in the starting time of pulsed oscillators is objectionable because it degrades the signal-to-noise ratio in systems employing super-regenerative receivers or pulse-time modulation. The time and spectral distributions of noise effects in typical oscillators are derived and discussed in the following sections.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1960","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Noise in Oscillators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise in Oscillators","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n8-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033522S","chronDate":"Aug.  1960","isNumber":"4066184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"145","articleId":"4066198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4066199,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

The analysis considers the effects of resistive loss and stray parasitic reactance in the junction-diode that provides the essential nonlinear reactance. It is shown that the conditions necessary for minimum noise temperature are compatible with those necessary for maximum gain-bandwidth product only if the diode has a high self-resonant frequency (the frequency at which the average diode capacitance resonates with the diode lead inductance). It is also shown that minimum noise temperature is always achieved when the diode loss alone is used as the idler circuit loading (regardless of the temperature of any additional idler loading), that there is a characteristic figure of merit for the diode, and that there is an optimum pump frequency. Based on the equations derived, universal curves have been drawn that enable the design of an optimum amplifier when the signal frequency and diode characteristics are specified. In conclusion, it is shown that if junction-diode parametric amplifiers operated at room temperature are to seriously challenge the low-noise performance of the maser at microwave frequencies, a substantial improvement in the diode figure of merit is required.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Temperature","Frequency","Parasitic capacitance","Inductance","Circuit noise","Noise figure","Equations","Signal design","Microwave amplifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287672","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4066208/04066218.pdf","startPage":"1583","endPage":"1590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1960.287672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Noise and Gain-Bandwidth Performance for a Practical One-Port Parametric Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4066218","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Noise and Gain-Bandwidth Performance for a Practical One-Port Parametric Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066218/","volume":"48","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1960","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1960","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Noise and Gain-Bandwidth Performance for a Practical One-Port Parametric Amplifier","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v48-n9-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034638S","chronDate":"Sept.  1960","isNumber":"4066208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"14","articleId":"4066218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4066245,"authors":[{"name":"Marvin Minsky","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computation Center, Research Lab of Electronics, Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Marvin","lastName":"Minsky","id":"38095814500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-8390"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6634"}],"articleNumber":"4066245","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":448,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4661},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Problem-solving","Application software","Military computing","High performance computing","Libraries","Information processing","Environmental management","Planets","Technological innovation"]}],"abstract":"The problems of heuristic programming-of making computers solve really difficult problems-are divided into five main areas: Search, Pattern-Recognition, Learning, Planning, and Induction. A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287775","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4066234/04066245.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steps toward Artificial Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4066245","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1961","displayDocTitle":"Steps toward Artificial Intelligence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066245/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steps toward Artificial Intelligence","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v49-n1-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057201S","chronDate":"Jan.  1961","isNumber":"4066234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"448","articleId":"4066245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4066249,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Spectrum analysis and measurement indicate that if the CSSB system is applied to a conventional AM broadcast transmitter, a desired-to-undesired sideband ratio of slightly better than 30 db will be achieved under normal modulation conditions. Also described is a beat frequency problem which introduces a special type of undesired sideband component. This component falls extremely close to the carrier and should not be present during the vast majority of program conditions. Thus, the technique meets the requirement of theoretically distortion-free envelope characteristics with a good desired-to-undesired sideband ratio. Measurements are described which show the advantages of the system. It appears that the main advantage of the technique is to reduce co- and adjacent-channel interference effects. CSSB also provides a higher fidelity signal when received by conventional inexpensive broadcast receivers. The on-the-air tests indicated good listener acceptance of the new system. The system also appears to have applications in communications service where cost and size bar the use of conventional sideband techniques. The technique does not suffer from Doppler shift difficulties.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compatible Single Sideband","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287689","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4066283/04066288.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4066288","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1961","displayDocTitle":"Compatible Single Sideband","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compatible Single Sideband","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v49-n10-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058376S","chronDate":"Oct.  1961","isNumber":"4066283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"25","articleId":"4066288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4066381,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Over the past ten years, noise temperatures have been reduced from around 3,000\u00b0K to less than 5\u00b0K. The low-noise devices which are currently competitive or which show future promise include traveling-wave tubes, parametric amplifiers, tunnel diodes, masers, photon counters, and photosensitive detectors. This paper discusses the various techniques for attaining low noise and summarizes the achievements relative to each technique. Effective noise reduction in traveling-wave tubes is accomplished by making the beam flow through an extended low-velocity region. Noise temperatures as low as 250\u00b0K have been measured on traveling-wave tubes at S band. Low noise has been attained in parametric devices using both electron beams and semiconductor diodes. Some of the lowest noise temperatures measured on any unrefrigerated microwave amplifiers are those for electron-beam parametric amplifiers. Refrigerated semiconductor-diode parametric amplifiers have given even lower noise temperatures. The tunnel-diode amplifier is the most recent negative resistance microwave device. It seems to have limitations as far as extremely low-noise performance is concerned, but nevertheless it is a good competitor for many low-noise applications. So far, the maser is the best in microwave low-noise amplification. Intrinsic maser noise temperatures of a few degrees are readily attainable. Photon counters and photosensitive detectors are inherently even quieter and give promise of considerable future potential.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1961","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1961","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"May 1961","volume":"49","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Noise Amplifiers for Centimeter and Shorter Wavelengths","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Noise Amplifiers for Centimeter and Shorter Wavelengths","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v49-n5-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066062S","chronDate":"May  1961","isNumber":"4066413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4066417","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4066420,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This leads to the synthesis of some novel pathologic circuits which have neither immittance nor scattering representations, such as a one-port, which is simultaneously an open circuit and a short circuit (v=i=0, the \"nullator\"), and the linear network in which voltages and currents at the ports are completely arbitrary (the \"norator,\" the unique, linear nonreciprocal, one-port).

Active systems, on the other hand, offer attractive performance through high directivity antennas but generally require stabilized vehicles. Further, the reliability of a satellite repeater amplifier is a critical factor. Automatic angle return arrays are investigated for both passive and active systems. These arrays, called Van Atta arrays, return a signal in the direction of incidence and are effective over at least \u00b145\u00b0. Thus only partial stabilization or single axis (spin) stabilization need be used, greatly simplifying the station-keeping orbit control problem. An active Van Atta (AVA) scheme has inherently high reliability since many of the distributed amplifiers can fail without serious performance degradation. The distributed structure also allows use of low-power solid-state amplifiers. This paper points up the salient advantages of the AVA system, and de'ineates the major areas where further work is indicated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066439","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1074","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4066439/04066455.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communications Satellites Using Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1961","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1961","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Communications Satellites Using Arrays","publicationDate":"June 1961","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communications Satellites Using Arrays","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v49-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041419S","chronDate":"June  1961","isNumber":"4066439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4066455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4066505,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This new device seems to have important potential in tracking targets and measuring distance, depth, or altitude. It operates by comparing the transmitted and reflected versions of a wide-bandwidth, random signal. The discriminator is superior to FM radars in that it can operate at lower power levels; it avoids the so-called \"fixed error,\" and it is free of much of the ambiguity inherent in such periodically modulated systems. It can also operate as a tracking interferometer. The discriminator is a nonlinear feedback system and can be thought of as employing a form of cross-correlation along with feedback. The basic theory of operation is presented, and a comparison is made with the phase-lock FM discriminator. Variations of performance with respect to signal spectrum choice, target velocity, and signal and interference power levels are discussed quantitatively. The nonlinear, \"lock-on\" transient and the threshold behavior of the discriminator are described. Performance relations are given for tracking both passive and actively transmitting targets.

Previous papers have advanced the argument that the threshold occurs in the usual manner when noise peaks exceed the carrier envelope at the input to the frequency detector of a feedback demodulator. However, correlation between calculated values and carefully measured experimental values has been poor. The calculated values have been incorrect by orders of magnitude in many typical cases. In this paper it is shown that the threshold can also occur because of the feedback action of the demodulator. When this is taken into account, the threshold can be calculated accurately. It is shown that the threshold cannot be improved by the often suggested scheme of inserting a carrier of the proper phase at the input to the frequency detector. The phase-locked loop, a related device, is shown to have a threshold which is equal to or poorer than the threshold of the feedback demodulator for large modulation indices. It is shown that the stability of the feedback loop (and consequently the threshold) of the feedback demodulator is a function of modulation, but that by following the procedure given, the effect can be almost entirely eliminated. The results of this paper allow one to design feedback demodulators for the first time which will extend the threshold in a predictable manner.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4066515/04066527.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decreasing the Threshold in FM by Frequency Feedback","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4066527","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1962","displayDocTitle":"Decreasing the Threshold in FM by Frequency Feedback","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"50","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decreasing the Threshold in FM by Frequency Feedback","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v50-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022294S","chronDate":"Jan.  1962","isNumber":"4066515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4066527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4066548,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Previous work by Woodward and Elspas to determine limitations on radar resolution led to the concept of an ambiguity function which is a quantitative measure of radar resolution in range and range rate. This theory has been extended to include simultaneous resolution in range, range rate, azimuth and elevation and led to the derivation of a four-dimensional ambiguity function. Resolution constants derived from the ambiguity function show clearly the trade-offs between system parameters and resolution. A new concept, \"angular dispersion and compression,\" has been evolved from the theoretical development. An angular compression system, analogous to a pulse compression system, employs a pseudo-randomly dispersed pattern which is compressed in angle at the receiver with a correlation technique, to produce the effect of a narrow beam without having a physically narrow beam. The signal bandwidth's effect on the pattern of an antenna and on its angular resolution has been found to be slight, except for very large bandwidths. It has been concluded that trade-offs between signal complexity and antenna complexity have no practical advantage. Because of the presence of noise, radar measurement of target parameters is essentially equivalent to statistical estimation. Woodward and Elspas have shown that the range, range-rate ambiguity function is the natural quantity to use in making a maximum likelihood estimate of range and range rate. The technique of maximum likelihood estimation has been extended to angular measurement.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288247","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4066541/04066553.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1962.288247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Resolution in Radar Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4066553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1962","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Resolution in Radar Systems","volume":"50","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1962","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Resolution in Radar Systems","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v50-n10-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041132S","chronDate":"Oct.  1962","isNumber":"4066541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4066553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4066626,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We first propose a new approximate similarity search technique in which the probabilistic selection of the feature space regions is not based on the distribution in the database but on the distribution of the features distortion. Since our CBCR framework is based on local features, the approximation can be strong and reduce drastically the amount of data to explore. Furthermore, we show how the discrimination of the global retrieval can be enhanced during its post-processing step, by considering only the geometrically consistent matches. This framework is applied to robust video copy retrieval and extensive experiments are presented to study the interactions between the approximate search and the retrieval efficiency.

Such protocols lead to both errors and erasures at the compressed video application layer. We generically refer to such schemes as hybrid erasure-error protocols (HEEPs). In this paper, we analyze the utility of HEEPs for efficient transmission of video over wireless channels. In order to maintain the generic nature of the deductions in this paper, we base our analysis on two (rather abstract) communication schemes for wireless video: hybrid error-erasure cross-layer design (CLD) and hybrid error-erasure cross-layer design with side-information (CLDS). We make a comparative analysis of the channel capacities of these schemes over single and multi-hop wireless channels to identify the conditions under which the HEEPs can provide improved performance over conventional (CON) protocols. In addition, we employ Reed Solomon (RS) and low-density parity check (LDPC)-code-based forward-error correction (FEC) schemes to illustrate that the improvement in capacity can easily enable an FEC scheme employed in conjunction with a HEEP to provide improved throughput. Finally we compare the performance of CON, CLD, and CLDS in terms of video quality using the H.264 video standard.

Traditional interactive video retrieval approaches emphasize paradigms, such as query-by-keyword and query-by-example, to aid the user in the search for relevant footage. However, recent results in automatic indexing indicate that query-by-concept is becoming a viable resource for interactive retrieval also. We propose in this paper a new video retrieval paradigm. The core of the paradigm is formed by first detecting a large lexicon of semantic concepts. From there, we combine query-by-concept, query-by-example, query-by-keyword, and user interaction into the MediaMill semantic video search engine. To measure the impact of increasing lexicon size on interactive video retrieval performance, we performed two experiments against the 2004 and 2005 NIST TRECVID benchmarks, using lexicons containing 32 and 101 concepts, respectively. The results suggest that from all factors that play a role in interactive retrieval, a large lexicon of semantic concepts matters most. Indeed, by exploiting large lexicons, many video search questions are solvable without using query-by-keyword and query-by-example. In addition, we show that the lexicon-driven search engine outperforms all state-of-the-art video retrieval systems in both TRECVID 2004 and 2005","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2006.886275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2006.886275","startPage":"280","endPage":"292","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4066984/04067007.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4066984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Learned Lexicon-Driven Paradigm for Interactive Video Retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Learned Lexicon-Driven Paradigm for Interactive Video Retrieval","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067007/","accessionNumber":"9301034","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067007/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Learned Lexicon-Driven Paradigm for Interactive Video Retrieval","sourcePdf":"09tmm02-snoek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140768S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4066984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4066984","articleId":"4067007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":4067021,"authors":[{"name":"Ilya Balmages","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Balmages","id":"37283860600"},{"name":"Boaz Rafaely","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Boaz","lastName":"Rafaely","id":"37283159800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"4067021","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1109},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Array signal processing","Frequency","Cardiology","Acoustic measurements","Audio recording","Robustness","Signal processing","Acoustic arrays","Acoustic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open-sphere designs","spherical microphone arrays","acoustic measurement","open-sphere arrays","rigid-sphere arrays","spatial spherical modes","cardioid microphones"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array processing","open-sphere array","spherical Fourier transform","spherical microphone arrays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067021","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2006.881671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","abstract":"Spherical microphone arrays have been studied for a wide range of applications, one of which is acoustic measurement and analysis.

A method for overcoming this problem using an open dual-sphere array is proposed in this correspondence and then investigated and compared to an array configured around a rigid sphere and an array composed of cardioid microphones.

In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic approach to jointly track the location and speaking activity of multiple speakers in a multisensor meeting room, equipped with a small microphone array and multiple uncalibrated cameras. Our framework is based on a mixed-state dynamic graphical model defined on a multiperson state-space, which includes the explicit definition of a proximity-based interaction model. The model integrates audiovisual (AV) data through a novel observation model. Audio observations are derived from a source localization algorithm. Visual observations are based on models of the shape and spatial structure of human heads. Approximate inference in our model, needed given its complexity, is performed with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo particle filter (MCMC-PF), which results in high sampling efficiency. We present results-based on an objective evaluation procedure-that show that our framework 1) is capable of locating and tracking the position and speaking activity of multiple meeting participants engaged in real conversations with good accuracy, 2) can deal with cases of visual clutter and occlusion, and 3) significantly outperforms a traditional sampling-based approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9293277","htmlLink":"/document/4067033/","displayDocTitle":"Audiovisual Probabilistic Tracking of Multiple Speakers in Meetings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audiovisual Probabilistic Tracking of Multiple Speakers in Meetings","sourcePdf":"15tasl02-gaticaperez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124313S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4067016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4067016","articleId":"4067033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4067034,"authors":[{"name":"Richard C.

The proposed system first detects onsets and offsets, and then generates segments by matching corresponding onset and offset fronts. This is achieved through a multiscale approach.

This makes it necessary to use some form of preprocessing so that signal processing systems such as a speech recognizer or machine diagnosis can be effectively employed. In this contribution, we introduce and evaluate a new algorithm that uses independent component analysis (ICA) with a geometrical constraint [constrained ICA (CICA)]. It is based on the fundamental similarity between an adaptive beamformer and blind source separation with ICA, and does not suffer the permutation problem of ICA-algorithms. Unlike conventional ICA algorithms, CICA needs prior knowledge about the rough direction of the target signal. However, it is more robust against an erroneous estimation of the target direction than adaptive beamformers: CICA converges to the right solution as long as its look direction is closer to the target signal than to the jammer signal. A high degree of robustness is very important since the geometrical prior of an adaptive beamformer is always roughly estimated in a reverberant environment, even when the look direction is precise. The effectiveness and robustness of the new algorithms is proven theoretically, and shown experimentally for three sources and three microphones with several sets of real-world data","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2006.876730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067016","startPage":"715","endPage":"726","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4067016/04067041.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometrically Constrained Independent Component Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067041/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Geometrically Constrained Independent Component Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9293286","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometrically Constrained Independent Component Analysis","sourcePdf":"15tasl02-knaak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107364S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4067016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4067016","articleId":"4067041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4067045,"authors":[{"name":"Damian T.

It can be applied to the simulation of the acoustics of rooms through the generation of impulse responses suitable for auralization purposes. However, large-scale three-dimensional mesh structures are required for high quality results. These structures must therefore be efficient and also capable of flexible boundary implementation in terms of both geometrical layout and the possibility for improved mesh termination algorithms. The general one-dimensional N-port boundary termination is investigated, where N depends on the geometry of the modeled domain and the mesh topology used. The equivalence between physical variable Kirchoff-model, and scattering-based wave-model boundary formulations is proved. This leads to the KW-hybrid one-dimensional N-port boundary-node termination, which is shown to be equivalent to the Kirchoff- and wave-model cases. The KW-hybrid boundary-node is implemented as part of a new hybrid two-dimensional triangular digital waveguide mesh. This is shown to offer the possibility for large-scale, computationally efficient mesh structures for more complex shapes. It proves more accurate than a similar rectilinear mesh in terms of geometrical fit, and offers significant savings in processing time and memory use over a standard wave-based model.

Using the approach presented, a spherical microphone array can have very flexible layouts of microphones on the spherical surface, yet optimally approximate a desired beampattern of higher order within a specified robustness constraint. Depending on the specified beampattern order, our approach automatically achieves optimal performances in two cases: when the specified beampattern order is reachable within the robustness constraint we achieve a beamformer with optimal approximation of the desired beampattern; otherwise we achieve a beamformer with maximum directivity, both robustly. For efficient implementation, we also developed an adaptive algorithm for computing the beamformer weights. It converges to the optimal performance quickly while exactly satisfying the specified frequency response and robustness constraint in each step. One application of the method is to allow the building of a real-world system, where microphones may not be placeable on regions, such as near cable outlets and/or a mounting base, while having a minimal effect on the performance.

In the proposed PSO-based MA (PSOMA), both PSO-based searching operators and some special local searching operators are designed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. In particular, the PSOMA applies the evolutionary searching mechanism of PSO, which is characterized by individual improvement, population cooperation, and competition to effectively perform exploration. On the other hand, the PSOMA utilizes several adaptive local searches to perform exploitation. First, to make PSO suitable for solving PFSSP, a ranked-order value rule based on random key representation is presented to convert the continuous position values of particles to job permutations. Second, to generate an initial swarm with certain quality and diversity, the famous Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic is incorporated into the initialization of population. Third, to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, after the standard PSO-based searching operation, a new local search technique named NEH_1 insertion is probabilistically applied to some good particles selected by using a roulette wheel mechanism with a specified probability. Fourth, to enrich the searching behaviors and to avoid premature convergence, a simulated annealing (SA)-based local search with multiple different neighborhoods is designed and incorporated into the PSOMA. Meanwhile, an effective adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is employed to decide which neighborhood to be used in SA-based local search. Finally, to further enhance the exploitation ability, a pairwise-based local search is applied after the SA-based search. Simulation results based on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSOMA. Additionally, the effects of some parameters on optimization performances are also discussed","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4067063/04067067.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2006.883272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2006.883272","startPage":"18","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective PSO-Based Memetic Algorithm for Flow Shop Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067067/","displayDocTitle":"An Effective PSO-Based Memetic Algorithm for Flow Shop Scheduling","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067067/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9299477","pubMedId":"17278555","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective PSO-Based Memetic Algorithm for Flow Shop Scheduling","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb01-bliu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11892S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4067063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"336","xplore-issue":"4067063","articleId":"4067067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4067068,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Caponio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Caponio","id":"37592302700"},{"name":"Giuseppe Leonardo Cascella","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe Leonardo","lastName":"Cascella","id":"37297772700"},{"name":"Ferrante Neri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Ferrante","lastName":"Neri","id":"37288254000"},{"name":"Nadia Salvatore","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Nadia","lastName":"Salvatore","id":"37294163100"},{"name":"Mark Sumner","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Sumner","id":"37275823600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4067068","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":182,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1484},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067068","abstract":"A fast adaptive memetic algorithm (FAMA) is proposed which is used to design the optimal control system for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor.

The novel solution involves a \"team\" of deterministic learning automata (LA). The first real-life problem relates to resource allocation in web monitoring so as to \"optimize\" information discovery when the polling capacity is constrained. The disadvantages of the currently reported solutions are explained in this paper. The second problem concerns allocating limited sampling resources in a \"real-time\" manner with the purpose of estimating multiple binomial proportions. This is the scenario encountered when the user has to evaluate multiple web sites by accessing a limited number of web pages, and the proportions of interest are the fraction of each web site that is successfully validated by an HTML validator. Using the general LA paradigm to tackle both of the real-life problems, the proposed scheme improves a current solution in an online manner through a series of informed guesses that move toward the optimal solution. At the heart of the scheme, a team of deterministic LA performs a controlled random walk on a discretized solution space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the discretization resolution determines the precision of the scheme, and that for a given precision, the current solution (to both problems) is consistently improved until a nearly optimal solution is found-even for switching environments. Thus, the scheme, while being novel to the entire field of LA, also efficiently handles a class of resource allocation problems previously not addressed in the literature","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Automata-Based Solutions to the Nonlinear Fractional Knapsack Problem With Applications to Optimal Resource Allocation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2006.879012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4067063/04067077.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2006.879012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Learning Automata-Based Solutions to the Nonlinear Fractional Knapsack Problem With Applications to Optimal Resource Allocation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4067077/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9299491","pubMedId":"17278569","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Automata-Based Solutions to the Nonlinear Fractional Knapsack Problem With Applications to Optimal Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb01-granmo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059242S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4067063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4067063","articleId":"4067077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067078,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Herrera-Viedma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4067063/4067078/4067078-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Enrique Herrera-Viedma was born in 1969.

In such cases, experts may not put their opinion forward about certain aspects of the problem, and as a result they may present incomplete preferences, i.e., some preference values may not be given or may be missing. In this paper, we present a new model for group decision making in which experts' preferences can be expressed as incomplete fuzzy preference relations. As part of this decision model, we propose an iterative procedure to estimate the missing information in an expert's incomplete fuzzy preference relation. This procedure is guided by the additive-consistency (AC) property and only uses the preference values the expert provides. The AC property is also used to measure the level of consistency of the information provided by the experts and also to propose a new induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator, the AC-IOWA operator, which permits the aggregation of the experts' preferences in such a way that more importance is given to the most consistent ones. Finally, the selection of the solution set of alternatives according to the fuzzy majority of the experts is based on two quantifier-guided choice degrees: the dominance and the nondominance degree","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2006.875872","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4067063/04067078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2006.875872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067063","startPage":"176","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Decision-Making Model With Incomplete Fuzzy Preference Relations Based on Additive Consistency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Group Decision-Making Model With Incomplete Fuzzy Preference Relations Based on Additive Consistency","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9299492","pubMedId":"17278570","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067078/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Decision-Making Model With Incomplete Fuzzy Preference Relations Based on Additive Consistency","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb01-herreraviedma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144418S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4067063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"403","xplore-issue":"4067063","articleId":"4067078","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4067080,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfeng Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4067063/4067080/4067080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yanfeng Hou (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sichuan University, Sichuan, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Hubei, China.

The new wavelet-based methodology isolates the changes in CD and LLE in specific subbands of the EEG. The methodology is applied to three different groups of EEG signals: 1) healthy subjects; 2) epileptic subjects during a seizure-free interval (interictal EEG); 3) epileptic subjects during a seizure (ictal EEG). The effectiveness of CD and LLE in differentiating between the three groups is investigated based on statistical significance of the differences. It is observed that while there may not be significant differences in the values of the parameters obtained from the original EEG, differences may be identified when the parameters are employed in conjunction with specific EEG subbands.

With proper training, individuals can learn to modulate the amplitude of specific electroencephalographic (EEG) components (e.g., the 8-12 Hz mu rhythm and 18-26 Hz beta rhythm) over the sensorimotor cortex and use them to control a cursor on a computer screen. Conventional spectral techniques for monitoring the continuous amplitude fluctuations fail to capture essential amplitude/phase relationships of the mu and beta rhythms in a compact fashion and, therefore, are suboptimal. By extracting the characteristic mu rhythm for a user, the exact morphology can be characterized and exploited as a matched filter. A simple, parameterized model for the characteristic mu rhythm is proposed and its effectiveness as a matched filter is examined online for a one-dimensional cursor control task. The results suggest that amplitude/phase coupling exists between the mu and beta bands during event-related desynchronization, and that an appropriate matched filter can provide improved performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067114/","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4067114/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9301454","pubMedId":"17278584","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu $</tex></formula>-Rhythm Matched Filter for Continuous Control of a Brain-Computer Interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu $</tex></formula>-Rhythm Matched Filter for Continuous Control of a Brain-Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"54tbme02-krusienski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082397S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4067100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4067100","articleId":"4067114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4067115,"authors":[{"name":"Natalia Lago","affiliation":["Institute of NeuroSciences and Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4067100/4067115/4067115-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Natalia Lago received the B.

We evaluated the functional and morphological effects of either Pt wire LIFEs or polyimide-based thin-film LIFEs implanted in the rat sciatic nerve for 3 mo. The newly designed thin-film LIFEs are more flexible, can be micromachined and allow placement of more active electrode sites than conventional Pt LIFEs.

Of these three factors, the least investigated is the shadow fading, which is usually explained as a result of multiplication of large number of random attenuating factors in the radio channel. In this paper, the authors propose an additive model as an alternative physical basis for shadow fading within an \"extended local area\" where path loss is constant. Starting from a sum-of-sinusoids signal model, they show that under mild statistical assumptions on the powers of the sinusoids, the resulting signal power will have approximately Gaussian distribution in logarithmic scale. A cluster-based model for shadow fading emerges as a special instance of the general result. They present simulation and measurement results that support their theoretical findings. The new physical basis for shadow fading also provides insights into simulation and modeling of radio channels","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2006.883797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4067117/04067118.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2006.883797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Additive Model as a Physical Basis for Shadow Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067118/","displayDocTitle":"An Additive Model as a Physical Basis for Shadow Fading","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292334","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067118/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Additive Model as a Physical Basis for Shadow Fading","sourcePdf":"56tvt01-salo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112123S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4067117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4067117","articleId":"4067118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067121,"authors":[{"name":"Yisheng Xue","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems (NTS), University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany","Corporate Technology, Siemens Limited, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4067117/4067121/4067121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yisheng Xue (M'03) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2002.","His research interests include signal processing and protocol design for wireless communications."]},"firstName":"Yisheng","lastName":"Xue","id":"37278243500"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany","Department of Communication Systems (NTS), University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4067117/4067121/4067121-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Kaiser (SM'04) received the Ph.D. (with distinction) and German habilitation degrees in electrical engineering, both from Gerhard\u2013Mercator University, Duisburg, Germany, in 1995 and 2000, respectively.","From April 2000 to March 2001, he was the Head of the Department of Communication Systems, Gerhard\u2013Mercator University, and from April 2001 to March 2002, he was the Head of the Department of Wireless Chips and Systems, Fraunhofer Institute of Microelectronic Circuits and Systems, Duisburg.

This scheduler collects channel state information (CSI) from all users and allocates the resources to the user(s) experiencing favorable channel conditions. However, for a frequency-division-duplex system with a large number of users, how to efficiently collect the required CSI will be a challenging task, especially when the feedback links are of limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm to exploit multiuser diversity with possibly imperfect one-bit channel state feedback. The basic idea is to define a threshold lambda and let each user report one-bit information to the scheduler about the comparison between its measured channel fading level and lambda. Correspondingly, the scheduler uses these feedback bits to classify all users into two sets and assigns the channel to one user belonging to the set experiencing favorable channel conditions. Several implementation schemes are developed by attacking the optimization of lambda under different system configurations, covering both the case when the one-bit feedback is perfect and those when the one-bit feedback is imperfect. Computer simulations show that when the user number is large, say, more than ten users, the proposed scheduling supports significantly larger data rate over the round-robin scheduling, while in comparison with the optimum scheduling with complete CSI, the performance loss is limited if the one-bit feedback is of high reliability. In addition, our studies show that we can effectively enhance the robustness against feedback imperfectness by incorporating the feedback reliability into optimization of lambda","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2006.883784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4067117/04067121.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2006.883784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067117","startPage":"183","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Multiuser Diversity With Imperfect One-Bit Channel State Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Multiuser Diversity With Imperfect One-Bit Channel State Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292349","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067121/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Multiuser Diversity With Imperfect One-Bit Channel State Feedback","sourcePdf":"56tvt01-xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1044S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4067117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4067117","articleId":"4067121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4067122,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Daoud Yacoub","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4067117/4067122/4067122-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michel Daoud Yacoub was born in Brazil in 1955.

In this paper, we will propose an example-based algorithm for moving vehicle detection. Different from previous works, this algorithm learns from examples and does not rely on any a priori model for vehicles. First, a novel scheme for adaptive background estimation is introduced. Then, the image is divided into many small nonoverlapped blocks. The candidates of the vehicle part can be found from the blocks if there is some change in gray level between the current image and the background.

To record movements of the upper extremities, a sensing units which included miniature gyroscopes, has been fixed to each of the forearms. An algorithm to detect and quantify tremor and another algorithm to quantify bradykinesia have been proposed and validated. Two clinical studies have been performed. In the first study, 10 PD patients and 10 control subjects participated in a 45-min protocol of 17 typical daily activities. The algorithm for tremor detection showed an overall sensitivity of 99.5% and a specificity of 94.2% in comparison to a video reference. The estimated tremor amplitude showed a high correlation to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) tremor subscore (e.g., r=0.87, p<0.001 for the roll axis). There was a high and significant correlation between the estimated bradykinesia related parameters estimated for the whole period of measurement and respective UPDRS subscore (e.g., r=-0.83, p<0.001 for the roll axis). In the second study, movements of upper extremities of 11 PD patients were recorded for periods of 3-5 hr. The patients were moving freely during the measurements. The effects of selection of window size used to calculate tremor and bradykinesia related parameters on the correlation between UPDRS and these parameters were studied. By selecting a window similar to the period of the first study, similar correlations were obtained. Moreover, one of the bradykinesia related parameters showed significant correlation (r=-0.74, p<0.01) to UPDRS with window sizes as short as 5 min.

We test our hypothesis by developing a physical system that consists of a silicon-neuron central pattern generator (CPG), which controls the motion of a beam, and position sensors that provide feedback information to the CPG. The silicon neurons that we use are integrated circuits that generate neural signals based on the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. We use this physical system to develop a model of the interaction between the sensory feedback and the complex dynamics of the neurons to create the closed-loop system behavior.

The authors prove that the problem can be represented as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and show that the latter yields a solution that consists of transmit power levels that are \"strongly Pareto optimal\". It was demonstrated that the MILP formulation can be used effectively to derive optimal scheduling and power levels for networks with as many as 30 designated communication links. The authors show that the MILP formulation can also be effectively solved to provide upper and lower bounds (corresponding to an approximation factor Delta) for the optimum schedule length of networks with as many as 100 designated links. It is proved that the integrated link scheduling and power control problem (ILSP) is NP-complete. Consequently, a heuristic algorithm of polynomial complexity is developed and investigated for solving the problem in a timely and practical manner. The algorithm is based on the properties of a novel interference graph, i.e., the \"generalized power-based interference graph\", whose \"chromatic\" and \"independence numbers\" provide fundamental bounds for the ILSP. It is demonstrated that the frame length of schedules realized by the heuristic scheme resides in the 25th percentile of those attained by the optimal mechanism for randomly generated topologies with as many as 30 designated communication links.

Conventional networking approaches are not suitable for such scenarios, where they face three main issues, namely: 1) heterogeneity, 2) scalability, and 3) complexity. The proposed solution draws inspiration from the living world in terms of 1) evolutionary paradigms able to drive the adaptation process of autonomic services and 2) social paradigms for the provisioning of the necessary cooperation mechanisms. The net result is the introduction of autonomic self-evolving services that are able to adapt to localized needs and conditions while ensuring the maintenance of a purposeful system.

Analytical expressions, relating the BER at the end of a multihop route with the mobility characteristics of the nodes and the switching strategy, are derived on the basis of a rigorous detection-theoretic approach. In particular, two network switching scenarios are considered: 1) opportunistic nonreservation-based switching (ONRBS), where a message flows from source to destination by opportunistically choosing the available shortest consecutive links and 2) reservation-based switching (RBS), where, after the creation of a multihop route from source to destination, the message is \"forced\" to flow over the reserved links, regardless of their actual lengths. The network performance is evaluated for both an ideal case (without interference) and a realistic case (with interference). The improved robustness against mobility offered by ONRBS, with respect to RBS, is analyzed and quantified. In particular, two node mobility models, known as direction-persistent (DP) and direction-non-persistent (DNP), are considered, and it is shown that DP mobility causes a much more profound degradation in the end-to-end route BER than DNP mobility. This conclusion is more pronounced in ad hoc wireless networks employing RBS. Overall, the results show that if the medium access control (MAC) protocol is not efficient in canceling or mitigating the interference, then the role of the switching/routing strategy in network performance is quite minor","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2006.883790","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4067117/04067222.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2006.883790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Mobility on the BER Performance of <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Mobility on the BER Performance of <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Wireless Networks","volume":"56","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9292356","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067222/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Mobility on the BER Performance of <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">Ad Hoc</emphasis> Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"56tvt01-ferrari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076187S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4067117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4067117","articleId":"4067222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4067661,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong-zhen Wu","affiliation":["Storage Technology Department Home Networking Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhong-zhen","lastName":"Wu","id":"38127951400"},{"name":"Han-chiang Chen","affiliation":["Storage Technology Department Home Networking Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Han-chiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293455700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0572-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4067661","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1090},"abstract":"With the increasing network speed over Ethernet, the servers and communication systems has become burdened with the large amount of TCP/IP processing required. The main reason for the CPU bottleneck is the TCP/IP stack being processing at a rate less than network speed. In recent years, TCP/IP offload engine (TOE) is emerging as an attractive solution, which can reduce the host CPU overhead and improve network performance at the same time. The objective of this paper is therefore to design and implement a TOE offload system which attempts to offload the processing of TCP/IP protocols onto our designed host bus adapter. We have also implemented our TOE acceleration hardware block and associated TCP firmware to accomplish this goal. The experimental results show that our offload system can provide better TCP/IP transmission rate up to 296 Mbps as receiver and 239 Mbps as sender compared with embedded OS based solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067604/4067605/04067661.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067605","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of TCP/IP Offload Engine System over Gigabit Ethernet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TCPIP","Engines","Ethernet networks","Protocols","Hardware","Acceleration","Microprogramming","Storage area networks","Field programmable gate arrays","Network servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["firmware","IP networks","local area networks","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TCP/IP offload engine system","gigabit Ethernet","CPU bottleneck","TOE offload system","TCP/IP protocol","TOE acceleration hardware block","TCP firmware","TCP/IP transmission rate","embedded OS based solution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of TCP/IP Offload Engine System over Gigabit Ethernet","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067661/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10251729","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of TCP/IP Offload Engine System over Gigabit Ethernet","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051456S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067604","isNumber":"4067605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067604","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4067605","articleId":"4067661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067672,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-mou Cheng","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Chen-mou","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277346300"},{"name":"Pai-hsiang Hsiao","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Pai-hsiang","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37266632200"},{"name":"H.

The comparison of the cooperative scheme to the non-cooperative scheme shows significant reduction in the transmission power of the mobile terminals.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286292","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067604/4067605/04067673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067605","startPage":"309","endPage":"314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Fair and Efficient Power Control in CDMA Wireless Data Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Fair and Efficient Power Control in CDMA Wireless Data Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067673/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"10251738","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Fair and Efficient Power Control in CDMA Wireless Data Networks","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05356S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067604","isNumber":"4067605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067604","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4067605","articleId":"4067673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067675,"authors":[{"name":"Junlin Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Junlin","lastName":"Li","id":"37292369300"},{"name":"Ghassan AlRegib","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ghassan","lastName":"AlRegib","id":"37269516000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0572-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4067675","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067675","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Bit rate","Quantization","State estimation","Parameter estimation","Additive noise","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","parameter estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-constrained distributed estimation","wireless sensor networks","distributed parameter estimation","active sensors","bit rate quantization","mean square error estimation","homogeneous sensor networks","quasi-optimal algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286294","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067604/4067605/04067675.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Constrained Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","abstract":"We consider the distributed parameter estimation in wireless sensor networks where a total bit rate constraint is imposed.

Then, we propose a quasi-optimal distributed estimation algorithm for heterogeneous sensor networks, which is also based on the equivalent 1-bit MSE function, and the upper bound of the estimation MSE of the proposed algorithm is also addressed. Furthermore, a theoretical lower bound of the estimation MSE under the total bit rate constraint is stated and it is shown that our proposed algorithm is quasi-optimal within a factor 2.2872 of the theoretical lower bound. Simulation results also show that significant reduction in estimation MSE is achieved by the proposed algorithm when compared to other uniform methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067675/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10251739","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067675/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Constrained Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Constrained Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041642S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067604","isNumber":"4067605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067604","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4067605","articleId":"4067675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067684,"authors":[{"name":"Masoomeh Torabzadeh","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masoomeh","lastName":"Torabzadeh","id":"37640490700"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Graduate University of Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI), Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37287372900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0572-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4067684","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Scheduling algorithm","Wireless networks","Traffic control","Round robin","Downlink","Receiving antennas","Throughput","Base stations","Mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","queueing theory","radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","multioutput fair queueing scheduler","antennas array","multiple-input multiple-output based systems","fair scheduling algorithm","wireless networks","multioutput fair packet scheduler","rate selection mechanism","virtual time system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","fair queueing","wireless scheduling"]}],"abstract":"The antennas array in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based systems can be used to increase the data rate.

A communication scheme known as the type-based random access (TBRA) is employed and its performance is characterized with respect to the mean transmission rate and the channel coherence index. For extreme values of channel coherence index i.e., 0 and infin, we give an optimal TBRA scheme which is essentially a sensor activation strategy that achieves the optimal allocation of transmission energy to spatial and temporal domains. For channels with zero coherence index, it is shown that there exists a finite optimal mean transmission rate maximizing performance. This optimal rate can be calculated numerically or estimated using the Gaussian approximation. On the other hand, for channels with infinite coherence index (i.e., no fading) the optimal strategy is to allocate all the energy to the spatial domain.

First, we propose a clustered network topology with sensor nodes grouped in collaborative sets attending to proximity. Then, we propose that all nodes belonging to any given cluster cooperatively transmit and receive data from other clusters, exploiting the diversity advantages of cluster-to-cluster virtual MIMO channels. In order to construct the cooperative transmission, we arrange each hop into two consecutive time slots: the intracluster slot, that accounts for data sharing within the cluster, and the intercluster slot for transmission between clusters; and we devise a cooperative reception protocol within the clusters based upon a simplified selection diversity algorithm. Optimum time assignment and power allocation for both slots are derived taking the cluster-to-cluster probability of outage as the metric. Results for one hop networks and for multi-hop networks are obtained, showing substantial diversity gains and energy savings. Furthermore, results show that the performance of the proposed virtual MIMO channels is equal to that of real MIMO channels but for a small SNR loss.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067780.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual MIMO Channels in Cooperative Multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless sensor networks","Performance analysis","Network topology","Collaboration","Protocols","Clustering algorithms","Diversity methods","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","network topology","protocols","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual MIMO channels","multihop wireless sensor networks","multiple-input-multiple-output","clustered network topology","sensor nodes","data sharing","cooperative reception protocol","power allocation","energy savings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Virtual MIMO Channels in Cooperative Multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067780/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528187","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual MIMO Channels in Cooperative Multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064587S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4067785,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"},{"name":"Jeffrey G.

As an alternative to traditional static frequency reuse patterns, this paper investigates cooperatively scheduled transmissions among neighboring base stations. We analytically show that cooperatively scheduled transmission, which is well within the capability of present systems, can achieve an expanded multiuser diversity gain in terms of ergodic capacity as well as almost the same amount of interference reduction as conventional frequency reuse. From a theoretical standpoint, an interesting aspect of this analysis comes from an altered view of multiuser diversity in the context of a multi-cell system. Previously, multiuser diversity capacity gain has been known to grow as O(log log K), from selecting the maximum of K exponentially-distributed powers. Because the positions of the users are important in a multi-cell system, we find instead that the gain is O(radic(1og K)), from selecting the maximum of a compound lognormal-exponential distribution.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286444","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base Station Cooperatively Scheduled Transmission in a Cellular MIMO TDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067785","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Base Station Cooperatively Scheduled Transmission in a Cellular MIMO TDMA System","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067785/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528201","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067785/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station Cooperatively Scheduled Transmission in a Cellular MIMO TDMA System","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060812S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4067786,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292963000"},{"name":"Rick S.

The second one is to find transmitted waveforms that minimize the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in estimating the target impulse response. Our analysis indicates that under the same total power constraint, these two criteria lead to the same solution for a matrix which specifies the essential part of the optimum waveform design. The solution employs water-filling to allocate the limited power appropriately. We also present an asymptotic formulation which requires less knowledge of the statistical model of the target.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286445","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067786.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveform Design for MIMO Radar Based on Mutual Information and Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067786","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067786/","displayDocTitle":"Waveform Design for MIMO Radar Based on Mutual Information and Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528204","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067786/","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform Design for MIMO Radar Based on Mutual Information and Minimum Mean-Square Error Estimation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072559S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4067788,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Aggarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37296337700"},{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37284625900"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067788","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Demodulation","Sliding mode control","Transmitting antennas","Detectors","Maximum likelihood decoding","Receiving antennas","Computational complexity","Monte Carlo methods","Constellation diagram"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced deterministic sequential Monte Carlo method","MIMO demodulation","multiple input multiple output system","linear MMSE-based preprocessing step","minimum mean square error","V-BLAST system","QAM signal constellation","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection"]}],"abstract":"We propose a low-complexity, linear MMSE-based sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique as an alternative to the sphere decoder for near-optimal demodulation in MIMO systems. Prior to the SMC procedure, the received signal is passed through a linear MMSE-based preprocessing step, which also determines an optimal channel-dependent order of detection and produces a sequential structure. The algorithm then draws the symbol samples in a deterministic fashion, and the survivor paths are selected based on their importance weights. The proposed algorithm exploits the rectangular structure of the QAM signal constellation by separating the real and imaginary parts of the signal to reduce the complexity associated with the listing and weight update steps.

Recently, there is focus on the novel direction of Compressed Sensing where the reconstruction can be done with very few-O(klogn)-linear measurements over a modified dictionary if the signal is compressible, that is, its information is concentrated in k coefficients with the original dictionary. In particular, the results prove that there exists a single O(klogn)timesn measurement matrix such that any such signal can be reconstructed from these measurements, with error at most O(1) times the worst case error for the class of such signals. Compressed sensing has generated tremendous excitement both because of the sophisticated underlying mathematics and because of its potential applications. In this paper, we address outstanding open problems in Compressed Sensing. Our main result is an explicit construction of a non-adaptive measurement matrix and the corresponding reconstruction algorithm so that with a number of measurements polynomial in k, logn, 1/epsiv, we can reconstruct compressible signals. This is the first known polynomial time explicit construction of any such measurement matrix. In addition, our result improves the error guarantee from O(1) to 1+epsiv and improves the reconstruction time from poly(n) to poly (klogn). Our second result is a randomized construction of O(kpolylog(n)) measurements that work for each signal with high probability and gives per-instance approximation guarantees rather than over the class of all signals. Previous work on compressed sensing does not provide such per-instance approximation guarantees; our result improves the best known number of measurements known from prior work in other areas including learning theory, streaming algorithms and complexity theory for this case. Our approach is combinatorial. In particular, we use two parallel sets of group tests, one to filter and the other to certify and estimate; the resulting algorithms are quite simple to implement.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067802.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combinatorial Algorithms for Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Dictionaries","Particle measurements","Polynomials","Approximation methods","Pressure measurement","Mathematics","Reconstruction algorithms","Time measurement","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","signal reconstruction","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial algorithm","compressed sensing","sparse approximation theory","signal reconstruction","non-adaptive measurement matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Combinatorial Algorithms for Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528256","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combinatorial Algorithms for Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067786S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4067803,"authors":[{"name":"David L.

We consider Fourier measurements (random sample of frequencies of f) and random Gaussian measurements. The method for reconstruction that has recently gained momentum in the sparse approximation theory is to relax this highly non-convex problem to a convex problem, and then solve it as a linear program. What are best guarantees for the reconstruction problem to be equivalent to its convex relaxation is an open question. Recent work shows that the number of measurements k(r,n) needed to exactly reconstruct any r-sparse signal f of length n from its linear measurements with convex relaxation is usually O(r poly log (n)). However, known guarantees involve huge constants, in spite of very good performance of the algorithms in practice. In attempt to reconcile theory with practice, we prove the first guarantees for universal measurements (i.e. which work for all sparse functions) with reasonable constants. For Gaussian measurements, k(r,n) lsim 11.7 r [1.5 + log(n/r)], which is optimal up to constants. For Fourier measurements, we prove the best known bound k(r, n) = O(r log(n) middot log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n(r) log(r log n)), which is optimal within the log log n and log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n r factors.

However, because the results placed no constraints on the modulation used, the input to the channel was Gaussian. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of modulation constraints on the throughput of hybrid-ARQ in a block fading environment. First, we consider the impact of modulation constraints on information outage probability for a block fading channel with a fixed rate codeword. Then, we consider the effect of modulation constraints upon the throughput of hybrid-ARQ, where the rate of each codeword varies depending on the instantaneous channel conditions. These theoretical bounds are compared against the simulated performance of HSDPA, a newly standardized hybrid-ARQ protocol that uses QPSK and 16-QAM bit interleaved turbo-coded modulation. The results indicate how much of the difference between HSDPA and the previous unconstrained modulation bound is due to the use of the turbo-code and how much is due to the modulation constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067815.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Throughput of Hybrid-ARQ in Block Fading under Modulation Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Fading","Multiaccess communication","Modulation coding","Turbo codes","Decoding","Protocols","Quadrature phase shift keying","Forward error correction","Automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","block codes","fading channels","Gaussian channels","interleaved codes","modulation coding","packet radio networks","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid-ARQ","automatic repeat request","Gaussian channel","information outage probability","block fading channel","codeword","HSDPA","high speed downlink packet access","QPSK","quadrature phase shift keying","16-QAM","quadrature amplitude modulation","bit interleaved turbo-coded modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Throughput of Hybrid-ARQ in Block Fading under Modulation Constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067815/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528304","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Throughput of Hybrid-ARQ in Block Fading under Modulation Constraints","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063278S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067816,"authors":[{"name":"Olgica Milenkovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Olgica","lastName":"Milenkovic","id":"37269359700"},{"name":"Emina Soljanin","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Emina","lastName":"Soljanin","id":"37269587200"},{"name":"Philip Whiting","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Whiting","id":"37282295200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067816","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067816","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Linear code","Iterative decoding","Error correction codes","Terminology","Bit error rate","Frequency","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","iterative decoding","linear codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial structure","parity-check matrix","codes bit error rate curve","iterative decoding","Lovasz local lemma","epsiv-probability bound","Bernoulli random variable","linear block-code","stopping-trapping sets","generalized covering array"]}],"abstract":"Certain combinatorial structures embedded in the parity-check matrix of linear codes, such as stopping and trapping sets, are known to govern the behavior of the codes' bit error rate curves under iterative decoding.

To take advantage of the frequency dispersion, each user transmits his partner's and his own data on different subcarriers spreading over the entire available bandwidth. The allocation of subcarriers to each user and his partners can be either pre-specified or dynamically determined. Compared to other cooperative strategies using the time division orthogonal channel allocation, this cooperative strategy benefits from the freedom of subcarrier allocation and the \"created\" block fading channel during the cooperation process. The performance characteristic is developed in terms of pairwise error probability (PEP) and frame error probability to illustrate the improved diversity gain for various cooperation scenarios.

However, the optimal scheduling requires that the full channel state information (CSI) for all users be available to the transmitter utilizing valuable bandwidth resources. In (S. Sanayei, et. al., 2004), the authors show that almost the same capacity growth holds even if the feedback rate from the users to the transmitter is reduced to 1-bit per sub-carrier per fading block for a limited class of channels. In this work, we present an alternative simple analysis for a more general class of channels resulting in a closed form expression for the ergodic achievable sum-rate. The mechanism of setting sub-optimal thresholds for the 1-bit quantizers is elucidated by simple lower bound to the sum-rate. Setting these sub-optimal thresholds ensures the same growth rate and non-interference limited behavior (at high-SNR regime) as that of the full-CSI scheme asymptotically with K.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286483","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067824.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate Analysis of General OFDM Downlink Channels with 1-bit Feedback per Sub-Carrier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067824","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067824/","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Analysis of General OFDM Downlink Channels with 1-bit Feedback per Sub-Carrier","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528278","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067824/","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-Rate Analysis of General OFDM Downlink Channels with 1-bit Feedback per Sub-Carrier","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067882S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4067825,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Liu","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Liu","id":"38276582700"},{"name":"Yeheskel Bar-Ness","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yeheskel","lastName":"Bar-Ness","id":"38272137900"},{"name":"Jianming Zhu","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38274467100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067825","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":798},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Transmitters","OFDM","Fading","Costs","Local oscillators","Digital video broadcasting","Wireless communication","Degradation","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","phase noise","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","phase noise","transmitter","receiver","WSSUS multipath fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","multipath fading channel"]}],"abstract":"OFDM system suffers from significant performance degradation due to the presence of phase noise, which causes the common phase error (CPE) and intercarrier interference (ICI) among subcarriers.

For space-time block coding (STBC),Tan et al [2005] proposed a method for reducing PAPR using cross antenna rotation and inversion. To better handle dispersive channel, space frequency block coding (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM is preferred. For such scheme PAPR reduction approach named polyphase interleaving and inversion (PII) was proposed by Zoran and Bar-Ness. It is applied to SFBC MIMO-OFDM based Alamouti scheme with only two transmitting antennas. Extension to the case where more than two transmit antennas and especially the case of four antennas is the main issue of this paper. It employs Tarokh's generalized complex orthogonal code. As the reduced complexity version of PII, this scheme commonly goes under the abbreviation RC-PII (reduced complexity PII).","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067826.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"320","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Polyphase Interleaving and Inversion for SFBC MIMO-OFDM with Generalized Complex Orthogonal Code","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Interleaved codes","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Block codes","Dispersion","Frequency division multiplexing","Density functional theory","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","dispersive channels","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block coding","STBC","dispersive channel","polyphase interleaving-inversion","PII","SFBC MIMO-OFDM based Alamouti scheme","space frequency block coding","multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmitting antenna","Tarokh's generalized complex orthogonal code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Polyphase Interleaving and Inversion for SFBC MIMO-OFDM with Generalized Complex Orthogonal Code","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528285","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction by Polyphase Interleaving and Inversion for SFBC MIMO-OFDM with Generalized Complex Orthogonal Code","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-67.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038455S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4067830,"authors":[{"name":"Junshan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fulton School of Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Junshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281464300"},{"name":"Dong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fulton School of Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37396896500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067830","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Primal-Dual Algorithm for Joint Flow Control and MAC Design in Multi-hop Wireless Networks","abstract":"We study stochastic rate control for joint flow control and MAC design in multi-hop wireless networks with random access. Most existing studies along this avenue are based on deterministic convex optimization and the corresponding distributed algorithms developed therein involve deterministic feedback control. In a multi-hop wireless network, however, the feedback signal is obtained using error-prone measurement mechanisms and therefore noisy in nature. A fundamental open question is that under what conditions these algorithms would converge to the optimal solutions in the presence of noisy feedback signals, and this is the main subject of this paper. Specifically, we first formulate rate control in multi-hop random access networks as a network utility maximization problem where the link constraints are given in terms of the persistence probabilities. Using the Lagrangian dual decomposition method, we devise a distributed primal-dual algorithm for joint flow control and MAC design. Then, we focus on the convergence properties of this algorithm under noisy feedback information. We show that the proposed primal-dual algorithm converges (almost surely) to the optimal solutions only if the estimators of gradients are asymptotically unbiased. We also characterize the corresponding rate of convergence, and our findings reveal that in general the limit process of the interpolated process, corresponding to the normalized iterate sequence generated from the primal-dual algorithm, is a reflected linear diffusion process, not necessarily the Gaussian diffusion process.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067830.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286489","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286489","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067830","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Algorithm design and analysis","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Diffusion processes","Distributed algorithms","Feedback control","Utility programs","Lagrangian functions","Character generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","convergence of numerical methods","convex programming","distributed algorithms","interpolation","iterative methods","probability","radio networks","stochastic processes","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic primal-dual algorithm","joint flow control","medium access control","MAC design","multihop wireless network","stochastic rate control","random access network","deterministic convex optimization","distributed algorithm","deterministic feedback control","error-prone measurement mechanism","network utility maximization","persistence probability","Lagrangian dual decomposition method","convergence rate","interpolation","normalized iterate sequence","reflected linear diffusion process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067830/","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Primal-Dual Algorithm for Joint Flow Control and MAC Design in Multi-hop Wireless Networks","accessionNumber":"9528302","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4067830/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Primal-Dual Algorithm for Joint Flow Control and MAC Design in Multi-hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059294S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4067836,"authors":[{"name":"Jitendra K.

We assume the codebook is randomly constructed where the entries are independent and isotropically distributed. It has been shown that the randomly constructed codebook is asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we consider two types of signature selection criteria. One is to select the signature vector that minimizes the interference from other users. The other one is to select the signature vector to match the weakest interference directions. By letting the processing gain, number of users and feedback bits approach infinity with fixed ratios, we derive the exact asymptotic formulas to calculate the average interference for both criteria.

Under this scenario, we determine the statistical distribution of the cumulative interference at the output of a linear receiver, located anywhere to the two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, we provide the corresponding error performance analysis, which is valid for any linear modulation scheme. The proposed model captures all the essential physical parameters that impact network interference, but is simple enough to allow a tractable analysis and provide fundamental insights.

We propose a simple receiver consisting of a linear filter used to cancel ISI and improve the statistics for the iterative receiver that follows.

Power management is crucial to such interference-limited networks to improve the aggregate throughput. We consider sum-rate maximization of the network by optimum power allocation when conventional linear receivers (without interference cancellation) are utilized. It is shown that in the case of n=2 links, the optimum power allocation strategy is such that either both links use their maximum power or one of them uses its maximum power and the other keeps silent. An asymptotic analysis for large n is carried out to show that in a Rayleigh fading channel the average sum-rate scales at least as log(n). This is obtained by deriving an on-off power allocation strategy. The same scaling law is obtained in the work of Gowaikar et al., where the number of links, their end-points (source-destination pairs), and the relay nodes are optimally chosen all by a central controller. However, our proposed strategy can be implemented in a decentralized fashion for any number of links, arbitrary transmitter-receiver pairs, and without any relay nodes. It is shown that the proposed power allocation scheme is optimum among all on-off power allocation strategies in the sense that no other strategies can achieve an average sum-rate of higher order.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation and Asymptotic Achievable Sum-Rates in Single-Hop Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286519","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067860.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067860","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation and Asymptotic Achievable Sum-Rates in Single-Hop Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067860/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528245","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation and Asymptotic Achievable Sum-Rates in Single-Hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060536S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067861,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Boccardi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria del'lInformazione, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Boccardi","id":"37294661800"},{"name":"Howard Huang","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Huang","id":"37289495000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067861","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":673},"abstract":"In this paper, optimum power allocation to maximize the weighted sum rate assuming a ZF precoder under a PAPC is determined.

We use Shannon-theoretic tools to analyze the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency (known as the power-bandwidth tradeoff) for a simple communication protocol based on time-division decode-and-forward relaying in meaningful asymptotic regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under a system-wide power constraint on source and relay transmissions. The impact of multi-hopping and channel fading on the key performance measures of the high and low SNR regimes is investigated to shed new light on the possible enhancements in power/bandwidth efficiency and link reliability. In contrast to the common belief that in fading environments communicating over multiple hops suffers significantly in performance due to the worst link limitation, our results indicate that hopping could significantly improve the outage behavior over slow-fading networks and stabilize links against the random channel fluctuations. In particular, we prove that there exists an optimal number of hops that minimizes the end-to-end outage probability and characterize the dependence of this optimal number on the fading statistics and target energy and spectral efficiencies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Shannon-Theoretic Perspective on Fading Multihop Networks","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286526","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067867.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067867","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Shannon-Theoretic Perspective on Fading Multihop Networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067867/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Shannon-Theoretic Perspective on Fading Multihop Networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080974S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4067868,"authors":[{"name":"Gianmarco Romano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Seconda Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianmarco","lastName":"Romano","id":"37274010700"},{"name":"Francesco Palmieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Seconda Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Palmieri","id":"37268647200"},{"name":"Peter K.

A family of space-time trellis codes that achieve full cooperative diversity order without the assumption of synchronization has been recently proposed. The family is based on the stack construction by Hammons and El Gamal and its generalizations by Lu and Kumar. It has been shown that the construction of such a family is equivalent to the construction of binary matrices that have full row rank no matter how their rows are shifted. We call such matrices as shift full rank (SFR) matrices. Given such a code generated from an SFR matrix, for different delays occurring at the relays, the code corresponds to different trellis structures and thus has different diversity products in general. In this paper, we first give a pair of upper bound and lower bound of the diversity products for arbitrarily possible delays. Furthermore, for the special case of two relays and BPSK modulation, we present some detailed analyses for the relationship between the SFR generator matrices and the minimum values of all the diversity products corresponding to different delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4067872/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528328","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Some Diversity Product Properties of A Family of Space-Time Trellis Codes with Asynchronous Full Diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Diversity Product Properties of A Family of Space-Time Trellis Codes with Asynchronous Full Diversity","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072385S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067873,"authors":[{"name":"Che Lin","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Che","lastName":"Lin","id":"37694323300"},{"name":"Venugopal V.

The focus of the paper is on the class of space-time block codes known as linear dispersion (LD) codes, introduced by Hassibi and Hochwald. The LD codes are optimized with respect to the mutual information between the inputs to the space-time encoder and the output of the channel. The use of the mutual information as both a design criterion and a performance measure is justified by allowing soft decisions at the output of the space-time decoder. A spatial Fourier (virtual) representation of the channel is exploited to allow for the analysis of MIMO channels with quite general fading statistics. Conditions, known as generalized orthogonality conditions (GOC), are derived for an LD code to achieve an upper bound on the mutual information, with the understanding that LD codes that achieve the upper bound, if they exist, are optimal. Explicit code constructions and properties of the optimal power allocation schemes are also derived. In particular, it is shown that optimal LD codes correspond to beamforming to a single virtual transmit angle at low SNR, and a necessary and sufficient condition for beamforming to be optimal is provided. Finally, numerical results are provided to illustrate the optimal code design for two examples of sparse scattering environments. The performance of the optimal LD codes for these scattering environments is compared with that of LD codes designed assuming the i.i.d. Rayleigh (rich scattering) model, and it is shown that the optimal LD codes perform significantly better. The optimal LD codes are also compared to beamforming LD codes and it is shown that beamforming is nearly optimal over a range of SNR's of interest.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286532","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","startPage":"558","endPage":"563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Linear Dispersion Codes for Correlated MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067873","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Linear Dispersion Codes for Correlated MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067873/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528329","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4067873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Linear Dispersion Codes for Correlated MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068264S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4067874,"authors":[{"name":"Duong Hoang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Duong","lastName":"Hoang","id":"37286442200"},{"name":"Ronald A.

There has been a lot of work on improving the peer-to-peer link quality by using advanced coding or power and rate allocation between a single source node and its relays. However, how to efficiently and fairly allocate resources among multiple users and their relays is still unknown. In L. Dai et al., (2006) a novel multiuser cooperation protocol was proposed, where a power reward is adopted by each node to evaluate the power contributed to and by others so as to guarantee fairness. It was shown that in energy-constrained cooperative ad-hoc networks, fairness can actually bring significant throughput gains. In order to further improve the fairness, in this paper, we propose a price-aware cooperation protocol, where the residual energy information of each node is exploited to shape the relay set. Simulation results show that by using this price lever, fairness can be significantly improved compared to the fair cooperation protocol. This benefit turns out to bring much higher throughput than the traditional direct transmission (without cooperation) and full cooperation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286563","startPage":"734","endPage":"738","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067904.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Fairness in Energy-Constrained Cooperative Ad-Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Improved Fairness in Energy-Constrained Cooperative Ad-Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067904/","accessionNumber":"9528193","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067904/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Fairness in Energy-Constrained Cooperative Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045227S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4067905,"authors":[{"name":"Soroush Akhlaghi","affiliation":["Coding & Signal Transmission Laboratory, E&CE Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Soroush","lastName":"Akhlaghi","id":"37320596600"},{"name":"Amir K.

We address the problem of channel variation for the case of fixed-rate users using block coded modulation (BCM). It is assumed that the perfect CSI is known at the beginning of each block, while the channel varies over time. The impact of the outdated CSI is evaluated both analytically, and experimentally through Monte-Carlo simulation. The effect of the channel aging is modeled as an additive noise with time-varying power. We introduce a new method based on Hadamard transformation in order to equalize the noise power across the coding block.

However it may be desirable to use only subset of the available transmit and/or receive antennas to reduce the implementation cost and complexity. In this paper we propose a selection criterion (metric) for antenna subset in spatial multiplexing mode when sequential nulling and successive cancellation techniques are used in receiver such as VBLAST. We assume to use fixed modulation/demodulation and uniform power allocation per independent substream for each transmit antenna. Therefore the symbol error rate (SER) is a more important performance measurement than the capacity. Based on minimum signal to noise ratio (SNR), we derive optimal selection criteria for several different transmit/receive structures. Further, we show how the channel state information (CSI) known to transmitter is used for the antenna selection. Performance analysis and simulations that validate our proposal are also provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection for MIMO Systems with Sequential Nulling and Cancellation","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286565","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067906.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067906","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection for MIMO Systems with Sequential Nulling and Cancellation","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067906/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528199","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection for MIMO Systems with Sequential Nulling and Cancellation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040879S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067907,"authors":[{"name":"Erdem Bala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Erdem","lastName":"Bala","id":"37283573900"},{"name":"Leonard J.

If an ML decoder is used, these events will be minimum distance codewords; the traditional decoder used in LDPC codes, some variant of the message passing algorithm, will introduce non-codeword error events known as trapping sets. For long LDPC codes it is difficult to enumerate all of these dominant error events. A procedure to efficiently find dominant error events by using the regular low-density structure of an LDPC code is presented here. The search method can be adapted to work with LDPC codes of various regular and irregular degree distributions, but is especially suited to a very practical subset of LDPC known as regular {3, 6} codes of moderate block length. We also show how codes with very low error floors can be created by utilizing this search method.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286581","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067922.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Moderate Length Regular LDPC Codes with Low Error Floors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067922","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Moderate Length Regular LDPC Codes with Low Error Floors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067922/","publicationDate":"March 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9528355","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067922/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Moderate Length Regular LDPC Codes with Low Error Floors","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082828S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4067923,"authors":[{"name":"Woonhaing Hur","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Woonhaing","lastName":"Hur","id":"37839338100"},{"name":"Steven W.

It is widely assumed that these distributions are close to Gaussian. However, in many scenarios, this assumption is not valid, e.g., the case that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is low, or the degree of variable nodes exceeds a certain threshold. This article introduces a new (suboptimal) method for DE algorithm in low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We provide a more accurate model for the distribution of message bits (as compared to Gaussian) through matching the first n statistical moments. An iterative message passing algorithm is proposed to compute these moments from the graphical representation of the underlying code. We show that the proposed algorithm results in an improved estimate of the underlying EXIT chart as compared to using a Gaussian assumption. In this respect, the proposed method achieves a performance very close to that of the best earlier methods, while it offers a much lower complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067926.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"850","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Fast Density Evolution Method for LDPC Codes Using Higher Order Statistics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Higher order statistics","Iterative algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Cost function","Closed-form solution","Gaussian approximation","Laboratories","Bipartite graph","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","graph theory","higher order statistics","iterative methods","message passing","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["density evolution technique","tracking","log likelihood ratio","LLR","bipartite graph","Gaussian distribution","low-density parity-check code","LDPC","statistical moment","iterative message passing algorithm","graphical representation","EXIT chart","higher order statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"A New Fast Density Evolution Method for LDPC Codes Using Higher Order Statistics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067926/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528370","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Fast Density Evolution Method for LDPC Codes Using Higher Order Statistics","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05581S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067927,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37281269500"},{"name":"Thomas E.

We show that the proposed algorithm quickly converges to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) in most practical cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067937/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067937/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528401","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of MMSE Pulse in UWB Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of MMSE Pulse in UWB Communications","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066058S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067944,"authors":[{"name":"Suhas Mathur","affiliation":["WINLAB Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Suhas","lastName":"Mathur","id":"37302369200"},{"name":"Lalitha Sankaranarayanan","affiliation":["WINLAB Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lalitha","lastName":"Sankaranarayanan","id":"37294364800"},{"name":"Narayan B.

In particular, we consider two illustrative network models: (1) a Gaussian interference channel with receiver cooperation and (2) a multiple access channel (MAC) with linear multiuser detection. Allowing any arbitrary sharing of the sum-rate achieved by a coalition between member links in a Gaussian interference channel, it is shown that the grand coalition (coalition of all receivers) maximizes spectrum utilization and is also stable. For the linear MMSE multiuser detector, it is shown that the grand coalition is always stable and sum-rate maximizing, while for the decorrelating multiuser detector, the above observation is shown to be true only in the high SNR regime. Finally, transmitter cooperation in the context of a Gaussian interference channel is discussed, with focus on some open problems and a simplified framework for the resulting coalitional game is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","startPage":"949","endPage":"954","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067944.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalitional Games in Receiver Cooperation for Spectrum Sharing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Decoding","Game theory","Multiuser detection","Detectors","Radio transmitters","Integrated circuit modeling","Computer networks","Wireless networks","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Gaussian channels","least mean squares methods","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","radio receivers","spectral analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver cooperation","spectrum sharing","wireless network","coalitional game theory","Gaussian interference channel","multiple access channel","MAC","linear MMSE multiuser detector","minimum mean square error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Coalitional Games in Receiver Cooperation for Spectrum Sharing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067944/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067944/","accessionNumber":"9528361","publicationDate":"March 2006","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coalitional Games in Receiver Cooperation for Spectrum Sharing","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065744S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067945,"authors":[{"name":"Sudipto Guha","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, UPenn, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudipto","lastName":"Guha","id":"37270989100"},{"name":"Kamesh Munagala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kamesh","lastName":"Munagala","id":"37427216500"},{"name":"Saswati Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, UPenn, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Saswati","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37275242000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067945","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Costs","Frequency conversion","Multiaccess communication","Computer science","Power engineering and energy","Systems engineering and theory","Bandwidth","Hardware","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision making","probability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmission","probing strategy","multichannel wireless system","probability","channel state estimation","adaptive algorithm","decision making"]}],"abstract":"We consider a wireless system with multiple channels when each channel has several different transmission states. Different states are associated with different probabilities of successful transmissions. In such networks, we are faced with making transmission decisions in the presence of partial information about channel states. This (typically probabilistic) information about any channel can be refined by sending control packets in the channels. In presence of multiple alternative channels, this process of probing every channel to find the best one is onerous and resource consuming. There is a natural tradeoff between the resource consumed in probing and the estimate of channel state we can obtain. The desired tradeoff can be attained by judiciously determining which and how many channels to probe and also which channel to transmit. We present adaptive algorithms for provably approximating the desired tradeoffs within constant factors.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286604","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067945.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286604","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","startPage":"955","endPage":"960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jointly optimal transmission and probing strategies for multichannel wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067945","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Jointly optimal transmission and probing strategies for multichannel wireless systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067945/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067945/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528365","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly optimal transmission and probing strategies for multichannel wireless systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.141726S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4067946,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In order to limit interference to adjacent satellites, regulatory and standards bodies have established strict limits on the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) at a particular terminal in its off-axis direction. In communications on-the-move systems, because of the frequent motion of the antenna platform, antenna pointing errors are unavoidable. In this paper we demonstrate that such antenna errors will result in the EIRP exceeding the limit imposed by the standards and regulatory bodies. Also, in order to support mobile antenna terminals, a modification to the existing EIRP spectral density is suggested.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067946.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"966","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Induced Antenna Pointing Errors in Satellite Communications On-The-Move Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite antennas","Satellite communication","Military satellites","FCC","Frequency","Interference","Directive antennas","Statistical distributions","Laboratories","Military communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile antennas","satellite antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion induced antenna pointing error","satellite communication","on-the-move system","mobile antenna terminal","EIRP spectral density","effective isotropic radiated power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Motion Induced Antenna Pointing Errors in Satellite Communications On-The-Move Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067946/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528371","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Induced Antenna Pointing Errors in Satellite Communications On-The-Move Systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03384S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067949,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Alireza Razavi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Birjand, Birjand, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Alireza","lastName":"Razavi","id":"37412233000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067949","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"abstract":"Resorting to some facts from analytic number theory and the following simple but important property of complex exponentials, we propose a new propagation delay estimation scheme for asynchronous CDMA systems over Gaussian channels: a circular shift in a complex exponential vector looks like multiplying it by a unit-magnitude complex number with shift-appropriate phase angle. In spite of the most existing schemes, the proposed method is a deterministic approach and therefore its performance does not depend on the near-far ratio and sampled data used for statistics estimation. It will be shown that over noise-free Gaussian channels, the propagation delay can be deterministically estimated by transmitting only two training symbols. We will dramatically improve the performance in noisy environments by modifying the method through consuming several more symbols for training.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067949.pdf","startPage":"979","endPage":"983","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of User Codes for Deterministic Propagation Delay Estimation in Asynchronous CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Propagation delay","Delay estimation","Multiaccess communication","Gaussian channels","Working environment noise","Statistics","Phase estimation","Bandwidth","Design engineering","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","delay estimation","Gaussian channels","signal sampling","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic propagation delay estimation","asynchronous CDMA system","code division multiple access","Gaussian channel","complex exponential vector","sampled data","statistics estimation","user code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asynchronous CDMA","propagation delay estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design of User Codes for Deterministic Propagation Delay Estimation in Asynchronous CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067949/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528383","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of User Codes for Deterministic Propagation Delay Estimation in Asynchronous CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05115S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067952,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292354200"},{"name":"Wei Mo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Mo","id":"37294382600"},{"name":"Yao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274225200"},{"name":"Zhengdao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengdao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067952","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Weibull fading channels","Rayleigh channels","Diversity methods","Probability density function","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Rician channels","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading channels","MIMO communication","multiplexing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity gain","multiplexing tradeoff","multiple-input multiple-output channel","fading channel","generic probability density function"]}],"abstract":"The optimal tradeoff between diversity gain and multiplexing gain for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels has been studied recently under the independently identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading assumption.

However, conventional vector precoding schemes are designed to minimize the transmit energy, which is suboptimal in terms of the received signals mean square error (MSE). This paper proposes modifications to vector precoding to overcome this shortcoming. Improvements of about 2 dB are realizable in a fast fading environment. Also, conventional vector precoding schemes usually result in unbalanced levels of interference, resulting in a poor performance for some users. Noting the above, another improvement is proposed by directly minimizing the bit error rate rather than the MSE. This improvement adds another 1 dB of gain, resulting in an overall gain of 3 dB in a quasi static fading environment. These improvements are also applied to Tomlinson-Harashima precoding with similar results.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286612","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067953.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286612","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector Precoding with MMSE for the Fast Fading and Quasi-Static Multi-User Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067953","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Vector Precoding with MMSE for the Fast Fading and Quasi-Static Multi-User Broadcast Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067953/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528396","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector Precoding with MMSE for the Fast Fading and Quasi-Static Multi-User Broadcast Channel","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038937S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4067954,"authors":[{"name":"Yingqun Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yingqun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279646200"},{"name":"Georgios B.

Simulations reveal that when BPSK is used, the novel LDPC-LP scheme results in up to 1.3 dB (1.0 dB) gain at rate frac12for regular (irregular) codes with a medium block size.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286613","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067954.pdf","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1013","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Low Density Parity-Check Coding and Linear Precoding for Rayleigh Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Joint Low Density Parity-Check Coding and Linear Precoding for Rayleigh Fading Channels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4067954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528399","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067954/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Low Density Parity-Check Coding and Linear Precoding for Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055527S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067957,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The users are unaware of the channel state information (CSI) whereas the receiver knows it perfectly and employs the successive group decoder (SGD). We obtain achievable outage probabilities for the case where an outage must be declared simultaneously for all users (common outage) as well as the case where outages can be declared individually for each user (individual outage). We then derive the optimum successive group decoder (OSGD) which simultaneously minimizes the common outage probability and the individual outage probability of each user, over all successive group decoders of permissible decoding complexity. For each channel realization, the OSGD is also shown to maximize the minimum of the per-user error exponents of all users not in outage. An adaptive SGD is derived which retains the outage optimality of the OSGD but also minimizes the expected decoding complexity. Asymptotically tight affine approximations are then obtained for the weighted sum common and individual outage capacities and the symmetric outage capacities. Simulation results with practical LDPC outer codes show that the OSGD results in greatly improved performance at low decoding complexities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4067957/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528405","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal successive group decoder for the slow-fading multiple access channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal successive group decoder for the slow-fading multiple access channel","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043735S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067959,"authors":[{"name":"Chuxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Chuxiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37278179700"},{"name":"Mohammad Ali Khojastepour","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Ali","lastName":"Khojastepour","id":"37275310400"},{"name":"Guosen Yue","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Guosen","lastName":"Yue","id":"37271317500"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375000"},{"name":"Mohammad Madihian","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Madihian","id":"37298760800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067959","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Parity check codes","Decoding","Protocols","Frame relay","Gaussian approximation","Mutual information","Detectors","AWGN","National electric code"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","parity check codes","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative relay channels","performance analysis","code design","LDPC code","channel capacity","B-block transmission","multiple-antenna channels","Gaussian approximation"]}],"abstract":"We treat the LDPC code design for relay channels in this paper. The capacity of relay channels has been analyzed in current literature. How to approach such capacity with the aid of good codes is, however, a challenging problem. An efficient structure is proposed to decouple the factor graph (FG) of a B-block transmission into successive partial FGs, and then, the code design can be performed over the partial FG. Based on this efficient structure, we develop the approaches to find the optimum code ensemble. In particular, we formulate the relay and the destination operations as virtual multiple-antenna channels. Moreover, we develop the approaches based on the binary symmetric channel modelling for the relay and Gaussian approximation to fast estimate the extrinsic mutual information of the destination detector output. Then we can analyze the performance of the relay system using the EXIT technique. Differential evolution is employed to search for the optimum code ensemble. Extensive simulations are further carried out to show the results of the proposed optimum code design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Code Design for Cooperative Relay Channels","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286618","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067959.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067959","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Code Design for Cooperative Relay Channels","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067959/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"10236467","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Code Design for Cooperative Relay Channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05835S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067960,"authors":[{"name":"Tairan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Tairan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291229000"},{"name":"Renqiu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Renqiu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280230700"},{"name":"Georgios B.

Enabling the latter however, calls for practically implementable protocols to cope with errors at relay nodes so that simple receiver processing can collect the diversity at the destination. To this end, we derive in this paper a class of strategies whereby decoded bits at relay nodes are scaled in power before being forwarded to the destination. The scale is adapted to the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the source-relay and the intended relay-destination links. With maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the destination, we prove that such link-adaptive regeneration (LAR) strategies effect the maximum possible diversity while requiring simple channel state information that can be pragmatically available at the relay. In addition, LAR exhibits robustness to quantization and feedback errors and leads to efficient use of power both at relay as well as destination nodes. Analysis and corroborating simulations demonstrate that LAR relays are attractive across the practical SNR range; they are universally applicable to multi-branch and multi-hop uncoded or coded settings regardless of the underlying constellation; and outperform existing alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067960.pdf","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1043","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Regenerative Relays for Link-Adaptive Cooperative Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Diversity reception","Resilience","Shadow mapping","Wireless communication","Protocols","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Channel state information","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","diversity reception","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart regenerative relay","link-adaptive cooperative communication","wireless communication network","space diversity","receiver processing","decoded bits","maximum ratio combining","MRC","channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Smart Regenerative Relays for Link-Adaptive Cooperative Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067960/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528219","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Regenerative Relays for Link-Adaptive Cooperative Communications","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04842S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4067961,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37696188400"},{"name":"D.

The sources in the system relay each other's transmissions via an orthogonal amplify-and-forward protocol. The channels are assumed to be flat fading and the sources are each required to satisfy an outage probability constraint. The analysis focuses on optimum energy allocation and energy efficiency for two distinctly different scenarios: (i) the sources have access to partial channel state information (the instantaneous channel amplitudes) and (ii) the sources have access to only the channel statistics. Numerical examples are presented for independent Rayleigh fading channels demonstrating that partial channel state information significantly improves the energy efficiency of cooperative transmission. Our results also show that, while cooperative transmission tends to have better energy efficiency than direct (noncooperative) transmission, opportunistic direct transmission with partial channel state information is often more energy efficient than cooperative transmission without knowledge of the channel state.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067961.pdf","endPage":"1049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Channel State Information on Optimum Energy Allocation and Energy Efficiency of Cooperative Wireless Transmission Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286620","startPage":"1044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067961","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Channel State Information on Optimum Energy Allocation and Energy Efficiency of Cooperative Wireless Transmission Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067961/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9528223","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4067961/","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Channel State Information on Optimum Energy Allocation and Energy Efficiency of Cooperative Wireless Transmission Systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057488S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067964,"authors":[{"name":"Melda Yuksel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Melda","lastName":"Yuksel","id":"37271624600"},{"name":"Elza Erkip","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Elza","lastName":"Erkip","id":"37266656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4067964","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"abstract":"We first examine a system with a single source-destination pair and two relays, each node with a single antenna, and explore whether this virtual multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system can mimic a physical MIMO in terms of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT).

The limitation comes from the fact that source and destination are connected to relays with finite capacity links. We provide communication strategies that achieve the best DMT of this relay system.

It has been shown that the distortion, can be reduced and the implementation of the system can be simplified if the switching frequency is much higher than the Nyquist rate of the modulating waveform. Hence, the input digital source is normally upsampled to a higher frequency. It was also proved that converting uniform samples to natural samples will decrease the harmonic distortion. Thus, in this paper, we examine a new approach that combines digital interpolation and natural sampling conversion. This approach uses poly-phase implementation of the digital interpolation filter and digital differentiators.

Our goal is to find the optimal balance between the increased data rate provided by multiplexing versus the error protection provided by diversity. We first examine the distortion achieved by concatenating a vector quantizer with a multiple antenna channel. We show that in the high-SNR asymptotic regime we can find a closed form expression for the distortion exponent as a function of the optimal point on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff curve. We also consider a numerical example for delay-constrained distortion.

A computationally inexpensive analytic mean square error (MSE) distortion rate (D-R) estimator for progressive wavelet coders which generates an exact D-R (distortion rate) function for 2-D and 3-D SPIHT algorithm is utilized from our previous work. Using the D-R function, a joint source-channel coding scheme using optimal equal error protection (EEP) is presented. Both analytic and Monte-Carlo simulations are presented for image and video sources. A system that uses two transmit antennas and two receive antennas expends 12 dB less in energy per bit for the same performance as a SISO system. Our results are also significantly better than outage probability JSCC schemes used by other authors. The joint source-channel coding (JSCC) scheme demonstrates that MIMO OFDM can achieve real-time high quality video transmission in low energy regions and the system is robust against the delay spread and Doppler frequency shift.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067978.pdf","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1145","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Video Transmission over MIMO OFDM Channels Using Space-Time Block Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Block codes","Rate distortion theory","Receiving antennas","Bandwidth","Error analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Mean square error methods","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","combined source-channel coding","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","real-time systems","space-time codes","video coding","visual communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time video transmission","multiinput multioutput system","MIMO OFDM channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","space-time block codes","faded wireless image transmission","mean square error distortion rate","MSE D-R estimator","progressive wavelet coder","SPIHT algorithm","joint source-channel coding scheme","JSCC","equal error protection","optimal EEP","Monte-Carlo simulation","transmitting antenna","receiving antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Video Transmission over MIMO OFDM Channels Using Space-Time Block Codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067978/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528377","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Video Transmission over MIMO OFDM Channels Using Space-Time Block Codes","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068453S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4067985,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37274173200"},{"name":"David J.

In this paper, we survey and classify methods employed for watermark synchronization and highlight some inherent difficulties in synchronization that arise due to the nature of multimedia signals. We then propose a framework that addresses these hurdles in practical applications. Our framework utilizes feature-based embedding in concert with error correction codes capable of handling not only substitutions caused by various perturbations but also insertion and deletion events caused by erroneous feature estimates. We present a practical scheme for speech watermarking based on the framework. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology indeed enables synchronization in scenarios where a mismatch in estimated features between embedder and receiver would otherwise cause synchronization loss. We explore connections of the framework with recent theoretical analyses of watermark synchronization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04067985.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1187","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4067985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Watermark Synchronization: Perspectives and a New Paradigm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Geometry","Degradation","Error correction codes","Speech","Multimedia systems","Robustness","Digital communication","Context","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encapsulation","error correction codes","feature extraction","multimedia communication","speech coding","synchronisation","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["watermark synchronization","multimedia signal","feature-based embedding","error correction code","perturbation","erroneous feature estimate","speech watermarking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4067985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Watermark Synchronization: Perspectives and a New Paradigm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4067985/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528407","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watermark Synchronization: Perspectives and a New Paradigm","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101004S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4067985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4068001,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of EE, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293538200"},{"name":"Vijay Subramanian","affiliation":["Mathematics of Communication Networks, Motorola, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37289003400"},{"name":"Rajeev Agrawal","affiliation":["Mathematics of Communication Networks, Motorola, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37286801200"},{"name":"Randall Berry","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Randall","lastName":"Berry","id":"37278715600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4068001","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Resource management","OFDM","Multiaccess communication","Physical layer","Quality of service","Wireless networks","Modulation coding","Data systems","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation coding","OFDM modulation","radio links","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink scheduling","resource allocation","OFDM-based wireless network","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","coding scheme"]}],"abstract":"We consider scheduling and resource allocation for the downlink of a OFDM-based wireless network.

We address this in the context of a utility-based scheduling and resource allocation scheme presented in earlier papers.

In this paper, we deal with the problem of joint estimation of symbol timing and transmitted symbols using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. Previous research work has developed SMC methods that achieve excellent performance in estimating channel reference parameters that include the symbol timing. However, these SMC methods are developed based on the assumption that the symbol-timing is time-varying, as a result, their application may be limited to systems whose symbol timing can be modeled as such. In this paper, we extend the work to problems where the symbol-timing is fixed. The posterior probability density of the fixed symbol timing is approximated by a beta distribution function whose parameters are sequentially updated. With such an approximation, an efficient SMC algorithm is developed that estimate the transmitted symbols and the symbol timing jointly.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286663","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068004.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Fixed Symbol Timing Estimation and Data Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068004","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Fixed Symbol Timing Estimation and Data Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068004/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528489","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4068004/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Fixed Symbol Timing Estimation and Data Detection","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048875S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4068005,"authors":[{"name":"Philip Schniter","affiliation":["Department ECE, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Schniter","id":"37271304700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4068005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Doubly Dispersive Channel Estimation for Pilot-Aided Pulse-Shaped Multi-Carrier Modulation","abstract":"In this paper, we propose several methods for the pilot-aided estimation of significant ICI coefficients resulting from pulse-shaped multicarrier modulation (PS-MCM) over DD channels.

The time-varying channel is assumed to be well-approximated by a complex exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM). A periodic (non-random) training sequence is arithmetically added (superimposed) at a low power to the information sequence at the transmitter before modulation and transmission. First we present a performance analysis of a first-order statistics-based channel estimator for time-varying random channels, accounting for modeling errors. Using these results we address the issue of selection of the number of bases from an equalization viewpoint where we optimize a signal-to-noise ratio for data detection. An illustrative computer simulation example is presented.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068007.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1313","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286666","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286666","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068007","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Time-varying channels","Transmitters","Performance analysis","Helium","Frequency estimation","Computer errors","Signal to noise ratio","Computer simulation","Information rates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","statistical analysis","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed training","doubly selective channel estimation","single-user frequency-selective time-varying channel","complex exponential basis expansion model","CE-BEM","first-order statistics","random channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068007/","displayDocTitle":"On Bias-Variance Trade-Off in Superimposed Training-Based Doubly Selective Channel Estimation","accessionNumber":"9528497","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4068007/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Bias-Variance Trade-Off in Superimposed Training-Based Doubly Selective Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05569S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4068008,"authors":[{"name":"Ari Hottinen","affiliation":["Nokia Group, Nokia Research Center, Finland"],"firstName":"Ari","lastName":"Hottinen","id":"37269045500"},{"name":"Tiina Heikkinen","affiliation":["MTT Economic Research, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Tiina","lastName":"Heikkinen","id":"37375037700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4068008","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Interference","Transmitters","Intelligent networks","Resource management","Decoding","Collaboration","Digital video broadcasting","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subchannel assignment","OFDM relay node","source-relay-destination link","frequency-selective channel","interference information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay networks","scheduling","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"The paper considers a source-relay-destination link in which the relay node is allowed to reassign the input subchannels to different output subchannels.

Results suggest that in the regime of light system loads, both strategies offer improved performance to each user as if no other users interfere or contend for the relay. However, they are inferior to the optimal dynamic decode forward (DDF) protocol in this regime. In the regime of heavy loads, the MARC with MAF offers better performance, and MARC with MDF degenerates into the multiaccess channel (MAC) without a relay. Moreover, the MAF protocol is optimal in the regime of high multiplexing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4068010/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528521","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for the Multiaccess Relay Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for the Multiaccess Relay Channel","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081402S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4068011,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Yang","affiliation":["Department Communications and Electronics, Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9I\u00e9communications, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089075479"},{"name":"Jean-claude Belfiore","affiliation":["Department Communications and Electronics, Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9I\u00e9communications, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4068011","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Protection","Hydrogen","Protective relaying","Error analysis","Rayleigh channels","Numerical simulation","Space time codes","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multiplexing","probability","protocols","space-time codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-relay three-slot cooperative scheme","amplify-and-forward cooperative scheme","diversity scheme","half-duplex two relay channel","outage probability","space-time code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068011","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068011.pdf","startPage":"1329","endPage":"1334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Two-Relay Three-Slot Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Scheme","abstract":"We propose a three-slot amplify-and-forward cooperative diversity scheme for a half-duplex two-relay channel.

We also describe the optimal processing scheme which enumerates all possible antenna combinations and selects the combination maximizing the instantaneous achievable rate for a given channel realization.","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068015.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1355","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Importance of Modeling the Mutual Coupling for Antenna Selection for Closely-Spaced Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the Importance of Modeling the Mutual Coupling for Antenna Selection for Closely-Spaced Arrays","htmlLink":"/document/4068015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9528536","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Importance of Modeling the Mutual Coupling for Antenna Selection for Closely-Spaced Arrays","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053843S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4068017,"authors":[{"name":"Karen Guan","affiliation":["ECE, UIUC, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Guan","id":"37694440800"},{"name":"Andrew C.

F.P. Kelly and his co-workers developed an allocation mechanism based on one dimensional bids, which is socially optimal if the buyers are price-takers. The idea is that the one-dimensional bid from a buyer specifies a surrogate valuation function. We propose the VCG-Kelly mechanism, which is obtained by composing the one-dimensional signaling idea of Kelly with the VCG mechanism, providing socially optimal allocation for strategic buyers at the Nash equilibrium point. The VCG-Kelly mechanism is studied in the case of a network rate allocation problem, and it applies to several others. It is shown how the revenue to the seller can be maximized or minimized using a particular one-dimensional family of functions. The Nash equilibrium point of the mechanism is shown to be globally stable.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286682","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068023.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286682","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VCG-Kelly Mechanisms for Allocation of Divisible Goods: Adapting VCG Mechanisms to One-Dimensional Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068023","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"VCG-Kelly Mechanisms for Allocation of Divisible Goods: Adapting VCG Mechanisms to One-Dimensional Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068023/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4068023/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528476","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VCG-Kelly Mechanisms for Allocation of Divisible Goods: Adapting VCG Mechanisms to One-Dimensional Signals","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050036S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4068025,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

Our approach generalizes the information theoretic water-filling approach of Bell. The paper has three main contributions: a new information theoretic design criteria for single transmit waveform with a receiving array using a weighted linear sum of the mutual informations between targets' radar signatures and the corresponding received beams (given the transmitted waveforms), we provide a family of design criteria that weight the various targets according to priorities. Then we generalize the information theoretic design criteria for designing multiple waveforms under joint power constraint when beamforming is used both at transmitter and receiver. Finally we provide a highly efficient optimization algorithm for optimizing the transmitted waveforms both for single target and multiple targets. We show that the optimization problem in both cases can be decoupled into a parallel set of low dimensional search problems at each frequency, with dimension defined by the number of targets, instead of the number of frequency bands used. The power constraint is forced through the optimization of a single Lagrange multiplier for the dual problem. We end with comments on the generalization of the proposed technique for other design criteria, e.g., for the linearly weighted MMSE design criterion.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286685","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068026.pdf","startPage":"1408","endPage":"1412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Theoretic Radar Waveform Design for Multiple Targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068026","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068026/","displayDocTitle":"Information Theoretic Radar Waveform Design for Multiple Targets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528485","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4068026/","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theoretic Radar Waveform Design for Multiple Targets","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086179S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4068029,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We find that minimum-TSC binary sets with signature length of the form 4m+1, m=1,2,..., are in all respects superior to minimum-TSC binary sets with signature length of the form 4m-1 (the latter class includes the familiar Gold sets as a small proper subset). \"4m+1\" sets perform practically at the single-user-bound (SUB) after decorrelating or MMSE processing (not true for \"4m-1\" sets).

A malicious jammer seeks to impair communication in a multiuser channel by injecting a spatially-correlated Gaussian interference signal. Full channel state information (CSI) is assumed, but the jammer has no knowledge of the users' signals. In the broadcast channel, a worst-case throughput (sum rate) is obtained as the Nash equilibrium of a certain strictly competitive game; in the multiple access channel, a general weighted sum-rate is similarly considered. Certain properties of the Nash equilibria of each game are developed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068063.pdf","startPage":"1635","endPage":"1639","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially-Correlated Jamming in Gaussian Multiple Access and Broadcast Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Broadcasting","MIMO","Interference","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Terminology","AWGN","Transmitters","Multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially-correlated jamming","broadcast channel","multiuser transmission","MIMO Gaussian multiple access","interference signal","channel state information","CSI","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Jamming","MIMO Broadcast Channel","MIMO Multiple Access Channel","Zero-sum Games"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","displayDocTitle":"Spatially-Correlated Jamming in Gaussian Multiple Access and Broadcast Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4068063/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528496","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially-Correlated Jamming in Gaussian Multiple Access and Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089567S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4068068,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Ma","id":"37266959500"},{"name":"Cihan Tepedelenlioglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Tepedelenlioglu","id":"37268523100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0350-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0349-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4068068","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Radio frequency","Receiving antennas","Fading","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Frequency diversity","Transmitters","RF signals","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","diversity reception","modulation coding","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver antenna selection","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","noncoherent space-time-frequency coded OFDM system","multiantenna system","frequency selective channel","multipath diversity","decoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies receiver antenna selection (AS) for multi-antenna systems operating over frequency selective channels, where the channel state information (CSI) is neither known at the transmitter nor at the receiver. We consider AS for noncoherent space-time-frequency (STF) coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems that employ unitary signals. An OFDM receiver with a single RF chain is employed, and the selection is based on the received signal power, where the receive antenna with the largest received signal power averaged over all subcarriers is chosen. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that using AS, the maximum spatial and multipath diversity can still be obtained without CSI at the receiver, the same as the full-complexity multi-antenna OFDM systems. We simplify code design and decoding using subcarrier grouping, which enables us to apply existing full diversity codes for noncoherent STF-OFDM systems to each group, in order to obtain maximum spatial and multipath diversity when AS is used. We also present a low-complexity suboptimal decoder that achieves full diversity and can be easily implemented in practice.","doi":"10.1109/CISS.2006.286402","publicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 40th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4067758/4067759/04068068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISS.2006.286402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4067759","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection for Noncoherent Space-Time-Frequency Coded OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068068","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection for Noncoherent Space-Time-Frequency Coded OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 March 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068068/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2006","accessionNumber":"9528508","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4068068/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection for Noncoherent Space-Time-Frequency Coded OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"CISS-00-309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066839S","chronDate":"22-24 March 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4067758","isNumber":"4067759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4067758","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4067759","articleId":"4068068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4068071,"authors":[{"name":"Kirtan N.

However, a static placement of monitors cannot be optimal given the short-term and long-term variations in traffic due to re-routing events, anomalies and the normal network evolution. In addition, most ISPs already deploy router embedded monitoring functionalities. Despite some limitations (inherent to being part of a router), these monitoring tools give greater visibility on the network traffic but raise the question on how to configure a network-wide monitoring infrastructure that may contain hundreds of monitoring points. We reformulate the placement problem as follows. Given a network where all links can be monitored, which monitors should be activated and which sampling rate should be set on these monitors in order to achieve a given measurement task with high accuracy and low resource consumption?

Although cryptographic authentication can assure the identity of a transmitter, authentication is not always desirable or possible as it requires key management and more extensive computations. In this paper we argue that it is desirable to have a functionality complementary to traditional authentication that can detect device spoofing with no dependency on cryptographic material. Towards this objective, we propose using forge-resistant relationships associated with transmitted packets to detect anomalous activity. Our strategy is generic, operates in a 1-hop neighborhood, and thus can locally provide protection in order to defend ad hoc or sensor networks from anomalous intrusions. As two specific constructions, we explore the use of monotonic relationships in the sequence number fields, and the enforcement of statistical characteristics of legitimate traffic. We then provide an example of how these relationships can be used to construct a classifier that provides a multi-level threat assessment.

A compromised node often tends to completely reveal its secrets to the adversary which in turn renders purely cryptography-based approaches vulnerable. How to secure the information aggregation process against compromised-node attacks and quantify the uncertainty existing in the aggregation results has become an important research issue. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a trust based framework, which is rooted in sound statistics and some other distinct and yet closely coupled techniques. The trustworthiness (reputation) of each individual sensor node is evaluated by using an information theoretic concept, Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance, to identify the compromised nodes through an unsupervised learning algorithm. Upon aggregating, an opinion, a metric of the degree of belief, is generated to represent the uncertainty in the aggregation result. As the result is being disseminated and assembled through the routes to the sink, this opinion will be propagated and regulated by Josang's belief model. Following this model, the uncertainty within the data and aggregation results can be effectively quantified throughout the network. Simulation results demonstrate that our trust based framework provides a powerful mechanism for detecting compromised nodes and reasoning about the uncertainty in the network. It further can purge false data to accomplish robust aggregation in the presence of multiple compromised nodes","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2006.288409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068087","startPage":"60","endPage":"69","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd Annual IEEE Communications Society on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4068086/4068087/04068108.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trust Based Framework for Secure Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4068108/","displayDocTitle":"A Trust Based Framework for Secure Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9463605","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust Based Framework for Secure Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"12006-Wei-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056776S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4068086","isNumber":"4068087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4068086","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4068087","articleId":"4068108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4068114,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Ji","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and Institute for Systems Research, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Ji","id":"37278629100"},{"name":"K.

In this paper, we consider the spectrum allocation in wireless networks with multiple selfish legacy spectrum holders and unlicensed users as multi-stage dynamic games. A belief-assisted dynamic pricing approach is proposed to optimize overall spectrum efficiency while keeping the participating incentives of the users based on double auction rules. Moreover, considering the budget constraints of the unlicensed users, a dynamic programming approach is further developed to optimize the spectrum allocation over time.

Previous WSNs attempt to harvest energy from various sources, and some also use supercapacitors instead of batteries to address the battery aging problem. However, they either waste much available energy due to impedance mismatch, or they require active digital control that incurs overhead, or they work with only one specific type of source. AmbiMax addresses these problems by first performing maximum power point tracking (MPPT) autonomously, and then charges supercapacitors at maximum efficiency. Furthermore, AmbiMax is modular and enables composition of multiple energy harvesting sources including solar, wind, thermal, and vibration, each with a different optimal size. Experimental results on a real WSN platform, Eco, show that AmbiMax successfully manages multiple power sources simultaneously and autonomously at several times the efficiency of the current state-of-the-art for WSNs","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2006.288421","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd Annual IEEE Communications Society on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd Annual IEEE Communications Society on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4068086/4068087/04068119.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2006.288421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AmbiMax: Autonomous Energy Harvesting Platform for Multi-Supply Wireless Sensor Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068119/","displayDocTitle":"AmbiMax: Autonomous Energy Harvesting Platform for Multi-Supply Wireless Sensor Nodes","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9463616","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4068119/","conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AmbiMax: Autonomous Energy Harvesting Platform for Multi-Supply Wireless Sensor Nodes","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"12006-Chulsung-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053827S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4068086","isNumber":"4068087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4068086","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"4068087","articleId":"4068119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4068131,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Wang","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37933213200"},{"name":"Mark Hempstead","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Hempstead","id":"37279375900"},{"name":"Woodward Yang","affiliation":["Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, USA"],"firstName":"Woodward","lastName":"Yang","id":"37276965300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0626-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5486"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5494"}],"articleNumber":"4068131","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":247,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Low-noise amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Hardware","Wireless communication","Radiofrequency identification","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifiers","power amplifiers","routing protocols","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic power consumption model","wireless sensor network devices","power amplifier","low noise amplifier","RF environment","single hop routing","multihop routing","communication protocol overhead","topology design","node placement","energy efficient routing schemes","power management"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068131","abstract":"A realistic power consumption model of wireless communication subsystems typically used in many sensor network node devices is presented. Simple power consumption models for major components are individually identified, and the effective transmission range of a sensor node is modeled by the output power of the transmitting power amplifier, sensitivity of the receiving low noise amplifier, and RF environment. Using this basic model, conditions for minimum sensor network power consumption are derived for communication of sensor data from a source device to a destination node. Power consumption model parameters are extracted for two types of wireless sensor nodes that are widely used and commercially available. For typical hardware configurations and RF environments, it is shown that whenever single hop routing is possible it is almost always more power efficient than multi-hop routing. Further consideration of communication protocol overhead also shows that single hop routing will be more power efficient compared to multi-hop routing under realistic circumstances. This power consumption model can be used to guide design choices at many different layers of the design space including, topology design, node placement, energy efficient routing schemes, power management and the hardware design of future wireless sensor network devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068087","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd Annual IEEE Communications Society on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd Annual IEEE Communications Society on Sensor and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4068086/4068087/04068131.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SAHCN.2006.288433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCN.2006.288433","startPage":"286","endPage":"295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Realistic Power Consumption Model for Wireless Sensor Network Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068131/","displayDocTitle":"A Realistic Power Consumption Model for Wireless Sensor Network Devices","htmlLink":"/document/4068131/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"9463628","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Realistic Power Consumption Model for Wireless Sensor Network Devices","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"12006-Qin-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062055S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4068086","isNumber":"4068087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4068086","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"4068087","articleId":"4068131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4068139,"authors":[{"name":"Yingying Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293324800"},{"name":"John-austen Francisco","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"John-austen","lastName":"Francisco","id":"37392085900"},{"name":"Wade Trappe","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Wireless Information Network Laboratory, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Wade","lastName":"Trappe","id":"37266719100"},{"name":"Richard P.

In the proposed model, a robot controlled by the network is introduced to assist with localization of a network of image sensors, which are assumed to have image planes parallel to the agent's motion plane. The localization algorithm for the scenario where the moving agent has knowledge of its global coordinates is first studied. This baseline scenario is then used to build more complex localization algorithms in which the robot has no knowledge of its global positions. Two cases where the sensors have overlapping and non-overlapping fields of view (FOVs) are investigated. In order to implement the discovery algorithms for these two different cases, a forest structure is introduced to represent the topology of the network. We consider the collection of sensors with overlapping FOVs as a tree in the forest. The robot searches for nodes in each tree through boundary patrolling, while it searches for other trees by a radial pattern motion. Numerical analyses are provided to verify the proposed algorithms.

To that end we propose a new family of distributed MAC scheduling algorithms combining synchronous two-level priority RTS/CTS handshaking with randomized time slot selection. We prove that for any fixed admissible load such algorithms converge to a feasible schedule (i.e., throughput-optimal). Furthermore, by adaptively biasing time-slot selection probabilities based on past history, one can develop variations that are also provably throughput-optimal and exhibit better convergence rates. Additionally under moderate loads local changes in load would lead to only local changes in contention patterns leading once again to fast convergence. This makes the case for adopting such protocols in wireless multi- hop networks, where aggregate loads and network topology are slowly varying.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"10235813","htmlLink":"/document/4068249/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Learning contention patterns and adapting to load/topology changes in a MAC scheduling algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning contention patterns and adapting to load/topology changes in a MAC scheduling algorithm","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"2006-Yung-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068425S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4068237","isNumber":"4053600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4068237","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4053600","articleId":"4068249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4068253,"authors":[{"name":"Anland Prabhn Subramanian","affiliation":["State University of New York, Stony Brook, USA"],"firstName":"Anland Prabhn","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37687800400"},{"name":"Milind M.

In this paper, a cross-layer methodology for the analysis of error control schemes in WSNs is presented such that the effects of multi-hop routing and the broadcast nature of the wireless channel are investigated. More specifically, the cross-layer effects of routing, medium access and physical layers are considered. This analysis enables a comprehensive comparison of forward error correction (FEC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) in WSNs. FEC schemes improve the error resiliency compared to ARQ. In a multi-hop network, this improvement can be exploited by reducing the transmit power (transmit power control) or by constructing longer hops (hop length extension), which can be achieved through channel-aware routing protocols. The results of our analysis reveal that for certain FEC codes, the hop length extension decreases both the energy consumption and the end-to-end latency subject to a target PER compared to ARQ. Thus, FEC codes can be regarded as an important candidate for delay sensitive traffic in WSNs. On the other hand, transmit power control results in significant savings in energy consumption at the cost of increased latency.

This paper proposes the energy-per-useful-bit (EPUB) metric for evaluating and comparing sensor network physical layers. EPUB includes the energy consumption of both the transmitter and receiver, and amortizes the energy consumption during the synchronization preamble over the number of data bits in the packet. Using EPUB, we compare six existing sensor network PHYs. Next, we optimize the PHY according to EPUB. We conclude that the EPUB of sensor network PHYs can be reduced by increasing data rate, lowering carrier frequency, and using simple modulation schemes such as OOK to reduce synchronization overhead","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068334/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"9453804","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4068334/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Energy-per-Useful-Bit Metric for Evaluating and Optimizing Sensor Network Physical Layers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Energy-per-Useful-Bit Metric for Evaluating and Optimizing Sensor Network Physical Layers","confLoc":"Reston, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"22006-Josephine-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070131S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4068086","isNumber":"4068283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4068086","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4068283","articleId":"4068334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4068335,"authors":[{"name":"Taiwen Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Wireless Networking & Communications Group, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Taiwen","lastName":"Tang","id":"37288918400"},{"name":"Ketan Mandke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Wireless Networking & Communications Group, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ketan","lastName":"Mandke","id":"37322221900"},{"name":"Chan-byoung Chae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Wireless Networking & Communications Group, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chan-byoung","lastName":"Chae","id":"37275083600"},{"name":"Robert W.

This method belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches and determines the loading level by optimizing the worst-case performance. Other than solving the optimal loading by iteration, as many existing methods in this field did, we derive a simple closed-form solution to the optimal loading after some approximations. In addition to reducing the computational complexity, this simple analytical solution reveals how different factors affect the optimal loading.

It turns out that the scheme of antenna selection plays an important part when dealing with high antenna correlation. It is shown that our proposed scheme for a system with two-transmit antennas and five-receive antennas offers better PEP performance than the algorithm based on the maximization capacity, but has little capacity loss.

In this paper, the expression for correlation coefficient and semi-correlation channel capacity is derived. The effect of PAS on the capacity is investigated. In general, capacity of uniform PAS is higher than that of truncated Gaussian PAS, and capacity of truncated Gaussian PAS is higher than that of truncated Laplacian PAS.

It detects layers in the order of ascending SNR of each layer, and then subtracts interference regenerated by the rough estimate from a hard decision based on some criteria, such as minimum mean square error (MMSE) or zero forcing (ZF). However, the improved estimate of the prior detected layers after interference cancellation (IC) will replace their rough estimate to implement IC for the posterior detected layers. Adding SIC into PIC in a proper order can minimize the error propagation (EP) among layers. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm improves the performance over PIC significantly with a little increment of complexity and delay. Otherwise, it does not perform as well as the classical ordered SIC (OSIC), but it reduces the complexity and delay greatly.

This scheme is especially fit for the bi-sectional BSs with zonal coverage along roadside. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can support both high and low speed users on road, and achieve a high system capacity gain especially in the cell edge. Within this scheme, the OFDM symbols are characterized into two groups: localized resource group (LRG), which is continuous in time-frequency (TF) domain; and distributed resource group (DRG) which is TF discrete.

The result of simulation experiment validates the efficiency of the algorithm","publicationTitle":"2006 6th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4068497/4068498/04068663.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"603","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2006.288975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2006.288975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Fuzzy Filter Based on Two Different Sets for Nonlinear Channel Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Fuzzy Filter Based on Two Different Sets for Nonlinear Channel Estimation","htmlLink":"/document/4068663/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9365382","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Fuzzy Filter Based on Two Different Sets for Nonlinear Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ITST-00-165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045171S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4068497","isNumber":"4068498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4068497","xplore-issue":"4068498","articleId":"4068663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4068686,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electnrcal Engineenig,City College, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278748200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9587-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4068686","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Maximum likelihood detection","Error probability","Digital images","Image restoration","Collaborative work","Sun","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear-complex LAS detectors","bit error rate","NP-hard optimum detector","random spreading CDMA","global maximum likelihood multiuser detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we demonstrate via simulation that the linear-complex LAS detectors can amazingly achieve the bit error rate of the NP-hard optimum global maximum likelihood (GML) multiuser detector in large random spreading CDMA systems where the number of users is over a thousand and the number of users per degree is less than 0.9.

However, progress within the last few years has slowed considerably (with some notable exceptions). It seems natural to then question whether the current logic-synthesis and technology-mapping algorithms for FPGA designs are producing near-optimal solutions. Although there are many empirical studies that compare different FPGA synthesis/mapping algorithms, little is known about how far these algorithms are from the optimal (recall that both logic-optimization and technology-mapping problems are NP-hard, if we consider area optimization in addition to delay/depth optimization). In this paper, we present a novel method for constructing arbitrarily large circuits that have known optimal solutions after technology mapping. Using these circuits and their derivatives (called Logic synthesis Examples with Known Optimal (LEKO) and Logic synthesis Examples with Known Upper bounds (LEKU), respectively), we show that although leading FPGA technology-mapping algorithms can produce close to optimal solutions, the results from the entire logic-synthesis flow (logicoptimization+mapping) are far from optimal.

A drawback of compression schemes based on LFSR reseeding is that the unspecified bits are filled with random values, which results in a large number of transitions during scan-in, thereby causing high-power dissipation. A new encoding scheme that can be used in conjunction with any LFSR-reseeding scheme to significantly reduce test power and even further reduce test storage is presented. The proposed encoding scheme acts as the second stage of compression after LFSR reseeding. It accomplishes two goals. First, it reduces the number of transitions in the scan chains (by filling the unspecified bits in a different manner). Second, it reduces the number of specified bits that need to be generated via LFSR reseeding. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces test power and in most cases provides greater test-data compression than LFSR reseeding alone","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.882509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4068913/04068924.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.882509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LFSR-Reseeding Scheme Achieving Low-Power Dissipation During Test","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068924/","displayDocTitle":"LFSR-Reseeding Scheme Achieving Low-Power Dissipation During Test","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9288679","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4068924/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LFSR-Reseeding Scheme Achieving Low-Power Dissipation During Test","sourcePdf":"26tcad02-jlee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065184S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4068913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4068913","articleId":"4068924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4068926,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Kuon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4068913/4068926/4068926-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ian Kuon (S'99) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2002 and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2004.

We describe the methodology by which the measurements were obtained and show that, for circuits containing only look-up table-based logic and flip-flops, the ratio of silicon area required to implement them in FPGAs and ASICs is on average 35. Modern FPGAs also contain \"hard\" blocks such as multiplier/accumulators and block memories. We find that these blocks reduce this average area gap significantly to as little as 18 for our benchmarks, and we estimate that extensive use of these hard blocks could potentially lower the gap to below five. The ratio of critical-path delay, from FPGA to ASIC, is roughly three to four with less influence from block memory and hard multipliers.

ECO routing is complicated as a result of huge existing obstacles and the requests for various design rules. The tile-based routing model results in fewer nodes of the routing graph than grid and connection-based routers; however, the number of nodes of the tile-based routing graph has grown to over a billion for system-on-chip designs, while no notable progress has been achieved in the routing speed of the tile-based router since it was proposed. This paper first proposes a novel routing graph reduction (RGR) method for promoting tile propagation speed and then depicts a new ECO routing design flow with RGR and enhanced global routing flow (EGRF). RGR can be used to remove redundant tiles as well as align and merge neighboring tiles in order to diminish tile fragmentation such that the tile-based ECO router can run twice as fast while still producing an optimal path. Compared with a commercial placement and routing tool, the proposed tile-based router with RGR obtains better routing performance and routing quality for three ECO routings. EGRF incorporates ECO global routing considering via-resource congestion metric with extended routing and global cell (GCell) restructuring to prevent routing failure in routable designs. The ECO router with the proposed design flow can perform up to 20 times faster than the original tile-based router at the cost of only a slight decline in routing quality. Experimental results also demonstrate that a more congested layout tends to have higher graph reduction rate. Also discussed herein are further refinements by dynamic weighting of via and wire resources based on the vacancy density of the routed design and further application of RGR to multiple-net routing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4068913/04068927.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.883923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.883923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Tile-Based ECO Router Using Routing Graph Reduction and Enhanced Global Routing Flow","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Wire","Delay","Integrated circuit interconnections","Design optimization","System-on-a-chip","Switches","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit layout","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECO router","routing graph reduction","enhanced global routing flow","engineering change order routing","delay optimization","noise optimization","tile-based routing model","system-on-chip designs","routing performance","routing quality","via-resource congestion metric","extended routing","global cell restructuring","routable designs","congested layout","multiple-net routing","detailed routing","gridless routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep submicrometer","detailed routing","engineering change order (ECO) routing","global routing","gridless routing","layout","physical design","system-on-chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Tile-Based ECO Router Using Routing Graph Reduction and Enhanced Global Routing Flow","volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4068927/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9288675","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Tile-Based ECO Router Using Routing Graph Reduction and Enhanced Global Routing Flow","sourcePdf":"26tcad02-li2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077474S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4068913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4068913","articleId":"4068927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4068928,"authors":[{"name":"Mingjie Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4068913/4068928/4068928-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingjie Lin (S'01) received the B.S. degree in cryogenics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1993, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering from Clemson University, Clemson, SC, in 2001.

The improvements target the delay and area of technology mapping as well as the runtime and memory requirements. 1) Improved cut enumeration computes all K-feasible cuts, without pruning, for up to seven inputs for the largest Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmarks. A new technique for on-the-fly cut dropping reduces, by orders of magnitude, the memory needed to represent cuts for large designs. 2) The notion of cut factorization is introduced, in which one computes a subset of cuts for a node and generates other cuts from that subset as needed. Two cut factorization schemes are presented, and a new algorithm that uses cut factorization for delay-oriented mapping for FPGAs with large LUTs is proposed. 3) Improved area recovery leads to mappings with the area, on average, 6% smaller than the previous best work while preserving the delay optimality when starting from the same optimized netlists. 4) Lossless synthesis accumulates alternative circuit structures seen during logic optimization. Extending the mapper to use structural choices reduces the delay, on average, by 6% and the area by 12%, compared with the previous work, while increasing the runtime 1.6 times. Performing five iterations of mapping with choices reduces the delay by 10% and the area by 19% while increasing the runtime eight times.

Unfortunately, manual exploration of this design space is impractical.

These techniques are applied together to minimize the area cost of the FPGA implementation while meeting a user-specified minimum throughput constraint.

As FPGA logic capacity has grown, locally accessed FPGA embedded memory blocks have increased in importance. When targeting FPGAs, application designers often specify high-level memory functions, which exhibit a range of sizes and control structures. These logical memories must be mapped to FPGA embedded memory resources such that physical design objectives are met. In this paper, a set of power-efficient logical-to-physical RAM mapping algorithms is described, which converts user-defined memory specifications to on-chip FPGA memory block resources. These algorithms minimize RAM dynamic power by evaluating a range of possible embedded memory block mappings and selecting the most power-efficient choice. Our automated approach has been validated with both simulation of power dissipation and measurements of power dissipation on FPGA hardware. A comparison of measured power reductions to values determined via simulation confirms the accuracy of our simulation approach. Our power-aware RAM mapping algorithms have been integrated into a commercial FPGA compiler and tested with 34 large FPGA benchmarks. Through experimentation, we show that, on average, embedded memory dynamic power can be reduced by 26% and overall core dynamic power can be reduced by 6% with a minimal loss (1%) in design performance. In addition, it is shown that the availability of multiple embedded memory block sizes in an FPGA reduces embedded memory dynamic power by an additional 9.6% by giving more choices to the computer-aided design algorithms","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient RAM Mapping Algorithms for FPGA Embedded Memory Blocks","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.887924","startPage":"278","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.887924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4068913/04068934.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4068934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient RAM Mapping Algorithms for FPGA Embedded Memory Blocks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4068934/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9288669","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient RAM Mapping Algorithms for FPGA Embedded Memory Blocks","sourcePdf":"26tcad02-tessier.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099472S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4068913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4068913","articleId":"4068934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4068935,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Tuan","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Tuan","id":"37297993000"},{"name":"Arif Rahman","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arif","lastName":"Rahman","id":"38021429700"},{"name":"Satyaki Das","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Satyaki","lastName":"Das","id":"37291450800"},{"name":"Steve Trimberger","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Trimberger","id":"37297561500"},{"name":"Sean Kao","affiliation":["NewportMedia, Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Kao","id":"38119486000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"4068935","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":884},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4068935","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Programmable logic arrays","Application specific integrated circuits","Energy management","Digital signal processing","Battery management systems","Design optimization","Programmable logic devices","Costs","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","low-power electronics","nanotechnology","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power FPGA","programmable logic devices","power management features","Pika","power savings","power optimizations","CMOS process","standby power","90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","programmable logic devices","standby power"]}],"abstract":"Programmable logic devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are useful for a wide range of applications.

Our design is based on a commercial low-cost FPGA and achieves substantial power savings through a series of power optimizations. The resulting architecture is compatible with existing commercial design tools. The implementation is done in a 90-nm triple-oxide CMOS process.

This paper presents an efficient thermal-analysis method of O(NlgN) complexity, where N is the number of blocks that discretize the heat-source or temperature-observation regions. The method is named LOTAGre and formulated using the Green's function for heat conduction through multiple-layer materials, which account for the structure of ULSI chips and the accompanying heat sinks and mounting accessories. In addition to analyzing the thermal effects of the distributive heat sources, LOTAGre also considers the ambient temperature effects that are generally excluded in conventional Green's function-based thermal-analysis tools in order to avoid the concomitant analytical complexity. By employing the well-known eigen-expansion technique and classical transmission-line theory, fully analytical and explicit formulas are derived in this paper for the multilayer Green's function with the inclusion of the s-domain version, the homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions to the heat-conduction equation. Then, the discrete cosine transform and its inversion are employed to accelerate the numerical computation of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions. This paper includes extensive experimental results to demonstrate that LOTAGre can be as accurate as FLUENT, a sophisticated computational fluid dynamics tool, while speeding up the simulation run time by two to three orders of magnitude in comparison to FLUENT as well as conventional Green's function-based thermal-analysis methods.

In a Holographic Versatile Disc (HVD) structure, the preformatted metadata reflective layer is used for the focus/tracking servo and reading address information, and the dichroic mirror layer is used for detecting holographic recording information without interfering with the preformatted information. A two-dimensional (2-D) digital page data format is used, and the shift-multiplexing method is employed to increased recording density of HVD. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the holographic material is very effective to increased recording density of the system. As the servo technology is being introduced to control the objective lens to be maintained precisely to the disk in the recording and the reconstructing process, a vibration isolator is no longer necessary.

In this effort, we evaluate a structured LDPC code using a perpendicular magnetic recording channel model that includes impairments such as transition noise, nonlinear transition shift, transition percolation, and baseline wander (BLW).

A t-EC w-bit parallel Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquengham (BCH) error-correction code (ECC) was designed for correcting the random bit errors of the flash memory chip, which is suitable for the randomly bit errors property and parallel I/O interface of the NAND-type flash memory. A code-banking mechanism was designed for the tradeoffs between the controller cost and the in-system programmability (ISP) support. With the ISP functionality and the Flash parameters programmed in the reserved area of the flash memory chip during the card production stage, the function for supporting various kinds of NAND flash memory could be provided by a single controller. In addition, built-in defect management and wear-leveling algorithm enhanced the product life cycle and reliability. Dual channel accessing of the Flash memory provided the good performance in data transfer rate. With respect to the proposed controller architecture, a real secure digital card (SD)/multimedia card (MMC) flash memory card controller chip was designed and implemented with UMC 0.18 mum CMOS process.

However, its complexity increases exponentially with the number of taps within the span of the ISI and with the number of symbol levels. We present a low-complexity sequence detection scheme, based on the Viterbi detection algorithm, which is generalized for multidimensional ISI channels in the presence of the predominant signal-dependent noise. The proposed variable state trellis (VST) approach detects and discards in real time states that are unlikely to correspond to the survivor path, thus reducing the complexity of the sequence detection significantly. After analyzing and exploiting a number of criteria (such as a priori reliability information, channel characteristics, and probability of error occurrences among different symbol levels), we propose three approaches to implement the VST scheme. The VST can be applied to any multidimensional ISI channel, including magnetic and optical storage. We compare the performance of the VST and conventional Viterbi algorithms for the multilevel two-dimensional optical storage channel, where media noise is predominant, and show that, with negligible performance loss, the computational complexity is reduced significantly","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.888067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.888067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4068998/04069050.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Sequence Detection Based on a Variable State Trellis for Multidimensional ISI Channels","volume":"43","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9292318","htmlLink":"/document/4069050/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence Detection Based on a Variable State Trellis for Multidimensional ISI Channels","sourcePdf":"43tmag02-moinian-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10934S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4068998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4068998","articleId":"4069050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4069061,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen N.

To improve MAP decoding performance, sequence estimation using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to identify each distribution of the jitter noise in the normal mixture model and estimates the missing sequences which are caused by continuous erasures","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.888372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4068979/04069065.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.888372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4068979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum <emphasis>a Posteriori</emphasis> Estimation Using the EM Algorithm for Linear Codes With Low-Density Generator Matrix in Magnetic Recording Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4069065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069065/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum <emphasis>a Posteriori</emphasis> Estimation Using the EM Algorithm for Linear Codes With Low-Density Generator Matrix in Magnetic Recording Systems","volume":"43","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292265","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4069065/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum <emphasis>a Posteriori</emphasis> Estimation Using the EM Algorithm for Linear Codes With Low-Density Generator Matrix in Magnetic Recording Systems","sourcePdf":"43tmag02-saito-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060047S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4068979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4068979","articleId":"4069065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4069068,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Shen","affiliation":["Center for Micromagnetics and Information Technologies, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37421327600"},{"name":"Manish Kapoor","affiliation":["Center for Micromagnetics and Information Technologies, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37636446000"},{"name":"Ryan Field","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Field","id":"37942976700"},{"name":"R.

The inhomogeneity of ECC media is predicted to enhance the thermal attempt frequency: this increases both writability and adjacent track erasure (ATE). The adverse change in ATE is, however, countered by the angular dependence of the ECC media switching field. This angular dependence is further exploited with a head design featuring a larger pole width than track width and the introduction of notches in the down track direction.

The dimensionality reduction methods studied are under the category of unsupervised linear transformations: principal component analysis, projection pursuit (PP), and band subset selection. Special attention is paid to an optimized version of the PP introduced in this paper: optimized information divergence PP, which is the maximization of the information divergence between the probability density function of the projected data and the Gaussian distribution. This paper is particularly relevant with current and the next generation of hyperspectral sensors that acquire more information in a higher number of spectral channels or bands when compared to multispectral data. The process to uncover these high-dimensional data patterns is not a simple one. Challenges such as the Hughes phenomenon and the curse of dimensionality have an impact in high-dimensional data analysis. Unsupervised feature extraction, implemented as a linear projection from a higher dimensional space to a lower dimensional subspace, is a relevant process necessary for hyperspectral data analysis due to its capacity to overcome some difficulties of high-dimensional data. An objective of unsupervised feature extraction in hyperspectral data analysis is to reduce the dimensionality of the data maintaining its capability to discriminate data patterns of interest from unknown cluttered background that may be present in the data set.

The performance for each detection algorithm is typically reported in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), which is a plot of the probability of detection versus false alarm as a function of the threshold setting on the output decision variable of each algorithm. In this paper, we present multisensor decision-fusion algorithms that combine the local decisions of existing detection algorithms for different sensors. This offers an expedient, attractive, and much simpler alternative to the design of an algorithm that fuses multiple sensors at the data level, especially in cases of limited training data where it is difficult to make accurate estimates of multidimensional probability density functions. The goal of our multisensor decision-fusion approach is to exploit the complimentary strengths of existing multisensor algorithms so as to achieve performance (ROC) that exceeds the performance of any sensor algorithm operating in isolation. Our approach to multisensor decision fusion is based on the optimal signal detection theory using the likelihood ratio. We consider the optimal fusion of local decisions for two sensors: a ground-penetrating radar and a metal detector. A new robust algorithm for decision fusion that addresses the problem in which the statistics of the training data are not likely to exactly match the statistics of the test data is presented.

In particular, each spectral channel (\"s-band\") is obtained by averaging a group of contiguous channels of the hyperspectral image (\"h-bands\"). Therefore, if one wants to define m s-bands, the problem can be formulated as the optimization of the related m starting and m ending h-bands. Toward this end, we propose to adopt, as an optimization criterion, an interclass distance computed on a training set and to generate a sequence of possible solutions by one of three possible search strategies. As the proposed formalization of the problem makes it analogous to a feature-selection problem, the proposed three strategies have been derived by modifying three feature-selection strategies, namely: 1) the \"sequential forward selection\", 2) the \"steepest ascent,\" and 3) the \"fast constrained search\". Experimental results on a well-known hyperspectral data set confirm the effectiveness of the approach, which yields better results than other widely used methods. The importance of this kind of procedure lies in feature reduction for hyperspectral image classification or in the case-based design of the spectral bands of a programmable sensor. It represents a special case of feature extraction that is expected to be more powerful than feature selection. The kind of transformation used allows the interpretability of the new features (i.e., the spectral bands) to be saved","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of Spectral Channels From Hyperspectral Images for Classification Purposes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.886177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4069093/04069122.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.886177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4069093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4069122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of Spectral Channels From Hyperspectral Images for Classification Purposes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4069122/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9292495","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of Spectral Channels From Hyperspectral Images for Classification Purposes","sourcePdf":"45tgrs02-serpico.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10539S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4069093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4069093","articleId":"4069122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4069129,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Azarian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Azarian","id":"37295966200"},{"name":"Hesham El Gamal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37273282800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4069129","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We build on Zheng and Tse's elegant formulation of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) to provide a better understanding of the asymptotic interplay between transmission rate, error probability, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in block-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.

This paper investigates the behavior of capacity when constraints are placed on the channel output signal (as well as generalizations thereof). While such a change in perspective leaves the point-to-point problem (essentially) unchanged, the main conclusion is that in certain network scenarios, including multiple-access and relay situations, both the structure of the problem and the conclusions change. For example, capacity results are found for the many-user Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) with arbitrarily dependent sources, cooperation, or feedback, and for the nondegraded Gaussian relay network. The investigations are motivated by recent questions arising in spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum allocation: Multiple independent networks share the same frequency band, but are spatially mostly disjoint. One approach to grant coexistence is via spatial interference power restrictions, imposed at the network level, rather than at the device level.

The latter bounds hold almost-surely for any sequence of randomly constructed LDPC codes of given degree distributions.

This leads in a natural way to a necessary and sufficient condition for such generic parity-check collections. We use this condition to construct a generic parity-check collection for codes of codimension r correcting all correctable erasure patterns of size at most m, for all r and mlesr, thus generalizing the known construction for m=3.

A deep interleaver combined with successive decoding decomposes a channel with memory into an array of parallel memoryless channels on which a conventional coding system can operate individually. The problems of joint channel estimation and decoding thus are separated without loss of capacity. This technique achieves channel capacity and so may be used to evaluate the capacities of different channels. A general information-theoretic framework is developed and applied to intersymbol interference (ISI), finite-state Markov, and Rayleigh-fading channels.

It is therefore of interest to consider how sparse parity-check matrices of binary linear block codes can be a function of the gap between their achievable rates and the channel capacity. This issue was addressed by Sason and Urbanke, and it is revisited in this paper. The remarkable performance of LDPC codes under practical and suboptimal decoding algorithms motivates the assessment of the inherent loss in performance which is attributed to the structure of the code or ensemble under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding, and the additional loss which is imposed by the suboptimality of the decoder. These issues are addressed by obtaining upper bounds on the achievable rates of binary linear block codes, and lower bounds on the asymptotic density of their parity-check matrices as a function of the gap between their achievable rates and the channel capacity; these bounds are valid under ML decoding, and hence, they are valid for any suboptimal decoding algorithm. The new bounds improve on previously reported results by Burshtein and by Sason and Urbanke, and they hold for the case where the transmission takes place over an arbitrary memoryless binary-input output-symmetric (MBIOS) channel. The significance of these information-theoretic bounds is in assessing the tradeoff between the asymptotic performance of LDPC codes and their decoding complexity (per iteration) under message-passing decoding. They are also helpful in studying the potential achievable rates of ensembles of LDPC codes under optimal decoding; by comparing these thresholds with those calculated by the density evolution technique, one obtains a measure for the asymptotic suboptimality of iterative decoding algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Block codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Sparse matrices","Channel capacity","Performance loss","Upper bound","Density measurement","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","block codes","channel capacity","channel coding","iterative decoding","linear codes","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood decoding","message passing","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary linear block codes","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC codes","iterative decoding","parity-check matrix","channel capacity","suboptimal decoding algorithm","maximum-likelihood decoding","memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channel","MBIOS","information-theoretic bound","message-passing decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block codes","iterative decoding","linear codes","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding","thresholds"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4069163","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.889606","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4069127/04069163.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.889606","startPage":"550","endPage":"579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4069127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parity-Check Density Versus Performance of Binary Linear Block Codes: New Bounds and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parity-Check Density Versus Performance of Binary Linear Block Codes: New Bounds and Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","volume":"53","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9301421","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parity-Check Density Versus Performance of Binary Linear Block Codes: New Bounds and Applications","sourcePdf":"53tit02-wiechman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047914S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","isNumber":"4069127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4069163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4069165,"authors":[{"name":"Yingquan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Yingquan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281229300"},{"name":"Christoforos N.

As would be expected from a feature-based approach, the runtime and visual quality of TopoLayout depends on the number and types of topological features present in the graph.

We describe a framework for direct volume rendering based on segmenting a volume into regions of equivalent contour topology and applying separate transfer functions to each region. Each region corresponds to a branch of a hierarchical contour tree decomposition, and a separate transfer function can be defined for it. The novel contributions of our work are: 1) a volume rendering framework and interface where a unique transfer function can be assigned to each subvolume corresponding to a branch of the contour tree, 2) a runtime method for adjusting data values to reflect contour tree simplifications, 3) an efficient way of mapping a spatial location into the contour tree to determine the applicable transfer function, and 4) an algorithm for hardware-accelerated direct volume rendering that visualizes the contour tree-based segmentation at interactive frame rates using graphics processing units (GPUs) that support loops and conditional branches in fragment programs","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4069227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4069227/04069241.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.47","startPage":"330","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology-Controlled Volume Rendering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069241/","displayDocTitle":"Topology-Controlled Volume Rendering","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4069241/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9288990","pubMedId":"17218749","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","publicationDate":"March-April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology-Controlled Volume Rendering","sourcePdf":"v0330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085898S","chronDate":"March-April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4069227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4069227","articleId":"4069241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4069255,"authors":[{"name":"Harro Stokman","affiliation":["Intelligent System Laboratory Amsterdam, Faculty of Science, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4069251/4069255/4069255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harro Stokman received the MS degree in 1996 and the PhD degree in 2000, both in computer science from the University of Amsterdam.

As there are many color models available, the inherent difficulty is how to automatically select a single color model or, alternatively, a weighted subset of color models producing the best result for a particular task. The subsequent hurdle is how to obtain a proper fusion scheme for the algorithms so that the results are combined in an optimal setting. To achieve proper color model selection and fusion of feature detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a method that exploits nonperfect correlation between color models or feature detection algorithms derived from the principles of diversification. As a consequence, a proper balance is obtained between repeatability and distinctiveness. The result is a weighting scheme which yields maximal feature discrimination. The method is verified experimentally for three different image feature detectors. The experimental results show that the fusion method provides feature detection results having a higher discriminative power than the standard weighting scheme. Further, it is experimentally shown that the color model selection scheme provides a proper balance between color invariance (repeatability) and discriminative power (distinctiveness)","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2007.58","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4069251/04069255.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2007.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4069251","startPage":"371","endPage":"381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection and Fusion of Color Models for Image Feature Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4069255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selection and Fusion of Color Models for Image Feature Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9325786","pubMedId":"17224609","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4069255/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection and Fusion of Color Models for Image Feature Detection","sourcePdf":"i0371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115076S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4069251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4069251","articleId":"4069255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4069256,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Ben-Artzi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4069251/4069256/4069256-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gil Ben-Artzi is currently a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Bar-Ilan University, Israel.

Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization. The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at a fraction of their computational cost. Finally, the proposed method is shown to be fairly robust to parameter tuning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9325788","pubMedId":"17224611","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4069257/","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Supervised Learning of Semantic Classes for Image Annotation and Retrieval","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Learning of Semantic Classes for Image Annotation and Retrieval","sourcePdf":"i0394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046784S","chronDate":"March  2007","isNumber":"4069251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"575","articleId":"4069257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4069258,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Serre","affiliation":["Center for Biological and Computational Learning, McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Brain & Cognitive Sciences Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4069251/4069258/4069258-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Serre received the diplome d'Ing\u00e9nieur in telecommunications from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications de Bretagne, Brest, France, in 2000, the DEA (MSc) degree from the University of Rennes, France, in 2000 and, in 2005, the PhD degree in neuroscience from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories.

It poses the task of completion as a global optimization problem with a well-defined objective function and derives a new algorithm to optimize it. Missing values are constrained to form coherent structures with respect to reference examples. We apply this method to space-time completion of large space-time \"holes\" in video sequences of complex dynamic scenes. The missing portions are filled in by sampling spatio-temporal patches from the available parts of the video, while enforcing global spatio-temporal consistency between all patches in and around the hole. The consistent completion of static scene parts simultaneously with dynamic behaviors leads to realistic looking video sequences and images. Space-time video completion is useful for a variety of tasks, including, but not limited to: 1) sophisticated video removal (of undesired static or dynamic objects) by completing the appropriate static or dynamic background information. 2) Correction of missing/corrupted video frames in old movies. 3) Modifying a visual story by replacing unwanted elements. 4) Creation of video textures by extending smaller ones. 5) Creation of complete field-of-view stabilized video. 6) As images are one-frame videos, we apply the method to this special case as

In order to explain the sparse nature of the reaction matrices, the electric fields that are excited by horizontal and vertical electric dipole sources are briefly overviewed. Then the variations of the reaction elements with distance are studied, and this information is used to provide a cut-off criterion for the reaction element calculations.

This article describes efforts to build a knowledge-based expert system for designing testable VLSI chips. A framework for a methodology incorporating structural, behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative aspects of known DFT techniques is introduced. This methodology provides a designer with a systematic DFT synthesis approach. The process of partitioning a design into subcircuits for individual processing is described and a new concept-I-path-is used to transfer data from one place in the circult to another. Rules for applying testable design methodologies to circuit partitions and for evaluating the various solutions obtained are also presented.

Two algorithms are proposed for self-testing of embedded bedded RAMs, both of which can detect a large variety of stuck-at and non-stuck-at faults. The hardware implementation of the methods requires a hardware test-pattern generator, which produces address, data, and read/write inputs. The output responses of the memory can be compressed by using a parallel input signature analyzer, or they can be compared with expected responses by an output comparator. The layout of memories has been considered in the design of additional BIST circuitry. The authors conclude by evaluating the two schemes on the basis of area overhead, performance degradation, fault coverage, test application time, and testing of self-test circuitry. The BIST overhead is very low and test time is quite short.

Components that are fragments of functions, such as those in gate-array designs, need a general model of a delay fault and a feasible method of generating test patterns and simulating the fault.

The authors describe results from 10 benchmark designs and discuss add-ons to a stuck fault simulator to enable transition fault simulation. Their experiments show that delay fault simulation can be done of random patterns in less than 10% more time than needed for a stuck fault simulation.","doi":"10.1109/MDT.1987.295104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/4069948/04069962.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4069948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.1987.295104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transition Fault Simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4069962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","displayDocTitle":"Transition Fault Simulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069962/","publicationDate":"April 1987","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transition Fault Simulation","sourcePdf":"MDT-v4-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050218S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"4069948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"295","articleId":"4069962","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4069991,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick P.

The work was completed in less time than scheduled and set an Intel record for tapeout to mask fabricator. The strategy incorporated both top-down and bottom-up design approaches. The top-down flow was external architectural definition, internal architecture, internal unit RTL (register transfer logic) and finally detailed logic. The bottom-up flow was detailed transistor and cell circuit design and layout, block (ALU, PLA, etc.) circuit design and layout, and finally global circuit design and layout. Testability also played an important part in the design's success. The 80386 combines two forms of designed-in test functions: built-in self-test and test hooks or functions explicitly designed in to aid testing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4069991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2007","publicationDate":"June 1987","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design And Test of the 80386","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design And Test of the 80386","sourcePdf":"MDT-v4-n3-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027997S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"4069975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4069991","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"}]
