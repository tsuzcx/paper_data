Our algorithm is based on the locality preserving projection (LPP) algorithm, which aims at finding a linear approximation to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the face manifold. However, LPP is nonorthogonal, and this makes it difficult to reconstruct the data. The orthogonal locality preserving projection (OLPP) method produces orthogonal basis functions and can have more locality preserving power than LPP. Since the locality preserving power is potentially related to the discriminating power, the OLPP is expected to have more discriminating power than LPP. Experimental results on three face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9141148","pubMedId":"17076419","htmlLink":"/document/1710004/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"11","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Laplacianfaces for Face Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Laplacianfaces for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"01710004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051217S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"36077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"566","xplore-issue":"36077","articleId":"1710004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1710013,"authors":[{"name":"Eldad Yahel","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Eldad","lastName":"Yahel","id":"37689290900"},{"name":"Ortwin Hess","affiliation":["Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Ortwin","lastName":"Hess","id":"37265376700"},{"name":"Amos Hardy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Physical Electronics, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Amos","lastName":"Hardy","id":"37265275800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"1710013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Erbium","Optical pulses","Optical fiber dispersion","Semiconductor process modeling","Optical fiber amplifiers","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Nonlinear equations","Optical propagation","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","nonlinear differential equations","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre dispersion","optical saturation","Schrodinger equation","superradiance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrally resolved approach","short pulse amplification","Er3+-doped fibers","pulse propagation","Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers","pulse rate-propagation equation model","gain dispersion","gain saturation","waveguide dispersion","chromatic dispersion","amplified spontaneous emission","nonlinear resonant dispersion","nonlinear Schrodinger equation","time-dependent power spectrum","amplified pulse","subpicosecond pulse propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Erbium (Er)","optical fiber amplifiers","optical fiber dispersion","optical pulse amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710013","abstract":"We study pulse propagation in Er\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3+</sup>\n-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) within the framework of a spectrally resolved pulse rate-propagation equations model.

Versatile high-power systems that are capable of cleaning both aqueous and gaseous streams in heterogeneous media, in either a corona above water reactor or an aerosol reactor, have been developed. Both reactors are capable of high-phenol removal yields from aqueous streams and increase the biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand ratio for several nonbiodegradable wastewaters to such degree that further biodegradation becomes possible. The PC combined with a catalyst is capable of cleaning gaseous streams that are polluted by toluene, styrene, and malodorous constituents. Reduction rates of toluene that are higher than 99% have been achieved, and very high odor-removal efficiency has been demonstrated. The reliable operation of high-power all-solid-state compact nanosecond pulsers has also been demonstrated. For the second phase of the project, a high-power pulser was designed. One compression stage suffices for the formation of 60-kV 3-J pulses across a reactor that has a discharge impedance of approximately 100 Omega at a pulse repetition frequency of up to 500 Hz; the rise time is 15 ns, and the duration is 100 ns.

Experimentally determined resistivity values were two to three orders of magnitude more than found using standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test methods. The 1-min wait time suggested for the standard ASTM tests is much shorter than the measured polarization current-decay times for each sample indicating that the primary currents used to determine ASTM resistivity are caused by the polarization of molecules in the applied electric field rather than charge transport through the bulk of the dielectric. Testing over much longer periods of time in vacuum is required to allow this polarization current to decay away and to allow the observation of charged-particle transport through a dielectric material. Application of a simple physics-based model allows separation of the polarization current and dark-current components from long-duration measurements of resistivity over day- to month-long time scales.

The method tracks the amplitude, phase, and frequency of all the interference components for power line frequency deviations up to about 4 Hz. A comparison is made between the performance of our method, former adaptive cancellers, and a narrow and a wide notch filter in suppressing the fundamental power line interference component. For this purpose a real ECG signal is corrupted by an artificial power line interference signal. The cleaned signal after applying all methods is compared with the original ECG signal. Our improved adaptive canceller shows a signal-to-power-line-interference ratio for the fundamental component up to 30 dB higher than that produced by the other methods.

These two parameters have potential application for use in remote biological sensing (for example they may be used as markers that reflect the physiological environment or as indicators for disease, within the gastrointestinal tract). We have investigated the effects of biofouling on these sensors, by exploring their response time and sensitivity in a model in vitro gastrointestinal system. The artificial gastric and intestinal solutions used represent a model both for fasting, as well as for the ingestion of food and subsequent digestion to gastrointestinal chyme. The results showed a decrease in pH sensitivity after exposure of the sensors for 3 h. The response time also increased from an initial measurement time of 10 s in pure GI juice, to ca. 25 s following the ingestion of food and 80 s in simulated chyme. These in vitro results indicate that changes in viscosity in our model gastrointestinal system had a pronounced effect on the unmodified sensor.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.883698","startPage":"2333","endPage":"2340","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/36082/01710175.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.883698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biocompatibility of a Lab-on-a-Pill Sensor in Artificial Gastrointestinal Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biosensors","Gastrointestinal tract","Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Sensor systems","Delay","In vitro","Diseases","Biological system modeling","Intestines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical sensors","diseases","microsensors","patient diagnosis","radiotelemetry","temperature sensors","viscosity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Biofouling","in vitro measurements","lab-in-a-pill","microfabricated sensors","radio telemetry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biofouling","in vitro measurements","lab-in-a-pill","microfabricated sensors","radio telemetry"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biocompatible Materials","Biomimetic Materials","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Gastrointestinal Contents","Gastrointestinal Tract","Hydrogen-Ion Concentration","Ion-Selective Electrodes","Prostheses and Implants","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Telemetry","Thermography","Transducers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Biocompatibility of a Lab-on-a-Pill Sensor in Artificial Gastrointestinal Environments","volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1710175/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9159527","pubMedId":"17073339","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biocompatibility of a Lab-on-a-Pill Sensor in Artificial Gastrointestinal Environments","sourcePdf":"01710175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161342S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"36082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"36082","articleId":"1710175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1710177,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The key component that allows the user to control the exoskeleton is the human machine interface (HMI). Setting the HMI at the neuro-muscular level may lead to seamless integration and intuitive control of the exoskeleton arm as a natural extension of the human body. At the core of the exoskeleton HMI there is a model of the human muscle, the \"myoprocessor,\" running in real-time and in parallel to the physiological muscle, that predicts joint torques as a function of the joint kinematics and neural activation levels. This paper presents the development of myoprocessors for the upper limb based on the Hill phenomenological muscle model. Genetic algorithms are used to optimize the internal parameters of the myoprocessors utilizing an experimental database that provides inputs to the model and allows for performance assessment. The results indicate high correlation between joint moment predictions of the model and the measured data. Consequently, the myoprocessor seems an adequate model, sufficiently robust for further integration into the exoskeleton control system","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.880883","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/36082/01710181.pdf","startPage":"2387","endPage":"2396","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.880883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Myoprocessors for a Neural Controlled Powered Exoskeleton Arm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Myoprocessors for a Neural Controlled Powered Exoskeleton Arm","volume":"53","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9159533","pubMedId":"17073345","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1710181/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Myoprocessors for a Neural Controlled Powered Exoskeleton Arm","sourcePdf":"01710181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094203S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"36082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"36082","articleId":"1710181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1710191,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our investigation is an exploration of an important and difficult aspect of implementing arbitrary Boolean functions by using CNN. A typical class of basic key Boolean functions is the class of linearly separable ones. In this paper, we focus on establishing a complete set of mathematical theories for the linearly separable Boolean functions (LSBF) that are identical to a class of uncoupled CNN. First, we obtain an essential relationship between the template and the offset levels as well as the basis of the binary input vector set in the uncoupled CNN. More precisely, we construct a neat binary input-output truth table and some interesting properties of the offset levels of the uncoupled CNN, and develop a practical design formula for the class of CNN template. Especially, we found a criterion for LSBF, which depends only on symbolic relations between a Boolean function's outputs. Furthermore, we develop a method for representing any linearly nonseparable Boolean function into a logic operation of a sequence of linearly separable ones for a small number of inputs","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2006.883845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/36083/01710200.pdf","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2006.883845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36083","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of Boolean Functions via CNN: Mathematical Theory, LSBF and Template Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710200/","displayDocTitle":"Realization of Boolean Functions via CNN: Mathematical Theory, LSBF and Template Design","volume":"53","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1710200/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9141160","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of Boolean Functions via CNN: Mathematical Theory, LSBF and Template Design","sourcePdf":"01710200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137902S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"36083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"36083","articleId":"1710200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1710206,"authors":[{"name":"C.

At Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD), we are addressing this need by developing a digital X-ray detector that can simultaneously provide high speed, high sensitivity, and a large active imaging area. The system consists of a special high-speed CCD detector optically coupled to a scintillator. In its current configuration, the system provides an active area of 5 cmtimes5 cm, a spatial resolution of ~100 mum, and can operate at speeds of up to 225 frames per second. The system has been used to acquire volumetric CT data with 360 projections in ~12 seconds compared to several minutes needed for most commercial systems.

Both detectors utilize a 64-channel flat panel photomultiplier tube (PMT). The intrinsic spatial resolution for the detectors was evaluated using Anger (i.e., simple centroid) positioning and a statistics based positioning (SBP) algorithm. We also compared the intrinsic spatial resolution for the 8-mm-thick LYSO crystal using different reflective materials (e.g., TFE Teflon, white paint, and a polymer mirror film) applied on the entrance surface of the crystal. The average energy resolution was 20% for the 4-mm-thick LSO crystal and ranged from 16% to 21%, depending upon reflective material, for the 8-mm-thick LYSO crystal. The average intrinsic spatial resolution for the 4-mm-thick crystal was 1.8-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) for Anger positioning to within 3 mm of the crystal's edge and 1.14-mm FWHM for SBP to within 2 mm of the edge. The average intrinsic spatial resolution for the 8-mm-thick crystal was 2.2-mm FWHM for Anger positioning to within 8 mm of the crystal's edge and 1.3- to 1.5-mm FWHM (depending on reflective material used) for SBP to within 2 mm of the edge.

The front-end consists in a cold unity gain buffer stage (with single sided input connection) followed by a room temperature second differential amplifying stage. The optimization of the input transistor of the set-up has been determined by comparing the performances obtained applying a low pass filter or the optimum filter at output of the front-end. To minimize EMI interference the output of the cold buffer stage and its ground reference signal, taken close to the buffer itself, are readout in differential way from the second stage. To minimize noise, in our circuit solution the differential amplifier has an input stage with a noise that is 1.6 times smaller (1.27 times smaller if we consider the Square Root noise, SRn) than in a standard differential solution. Since the series noise is inversely proportional to the Gate area, to further reduce the noise the input JFET of the second stage has a large Gate area, of about 1 nF, and a very small feedback resistance. The performances of the presented second differential stage amplifier are about 0.194 (nV)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n/Hz (440pV/radicHz for the SRn), and a figure of less than 1.21 (nV)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2 </sup>\n/Hz (or 1100 pV/radicHz SRn) at 1 Hz.

In the MIMO multicode CDMA systems, the reuse of the same spreading codes in different transmit antennas significantly degrades the equalization performance if the ST equalizer uses a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) weighting vector that minimizes the mean-squared error of the equalizer output chip sequence. As the CDMA despreader concatenated to an ST equalizer distorts interstream interference components differently from multipath interference and background noise components, the chip-level MMSE weighting vector usually steers in suboptimal directions in the signal space.

Based on a sum-capacity criterion, this letter shows that the optimal transmission strategy in an uplink or downlink channel with n antennas at the base-station involves more than n users at the same time. In particular, when remote users are equipped with m antennas each, the maximum number of data streams is shown to be upper bounded by n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, with each user transmitting or receiving up to m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2 </sup>\n data streams. This gives a dimension-counting interpretation for multiuser diversity. Multiple antennas at the base-station increases the total number of dimensions, thus allowing more users to transmit and receive at the same time.

We first approach this problem from the point of view of estimation theory by computing a lower bound on the estimation error and studying its properties. Then, based on the insight obtained from the analysis, efficient channel estimators are designed that perform close to the derived limit. The proposed channel estimators compute the long-term features of the multipath channel model through a subspace tracking algorithm by identifying the invariant (over multiple OFDM symbols) space/time modes of the channel (modal analysis). On the other hand, the fast-varying fading amplitudes are tracked by using least-squares techniques that exploit temporal correlation of the fading process (modal filtering). The analytic treatment is complemented by thorough numerical investigation in order to validate the performance of the proposed techniques.

The proposed method is a heuristic algorithm that eliminates a large number of pseudocodewords that can cause nonconvergence in the BP decoder. The augmented decoder is a multistage iterative decoder, where at each stage, the original channel messages on select symbol nodes are replaced by saturated messages. The key element of the proposed method is the symbol-selection process, which is based on the appropriately defined subgraphs of the code graph and/or the reliability of the information received from the channel. We demonstrate by examples that this decoder can be implemented to achieve substantial gains (compared with the standard locally operating BP decoder) for short LDPC codes decoded on both memoryless and ISI Gaussian channels. Using the Margulis code example, we also show that the augmented decoder reduces the error floors. Finally, we discuss types of BP decoding errors and relate them to the augmented BP decoder.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.881402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/36086/01710348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.881402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Belief-Propagation Decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","volume":"54","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Belief-Propagation Decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","sourcePdf":"01710348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057787S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","isNumber":"36086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1710348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1710349,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Our study includes design techniques for trellis-coded schemes with and without parallel paths, which allows us to find a tradeoff between low complexity and high performance. We present a new formulation of the constellation design problem for trellis-coded unitary space\u2013time modulation schemes. The two key differences in our approach against those of other authors are that we not only combine the constellation design and mapping by set partitioning into one step, but we also use directly the Chernoff bound of the pairwise error probability as a design metric. By novelly employing a theorem for the Clarke subdifferential of the sum of the\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k$</tex>\nlargest singular values of the unitary matrix, we also present a numerical optimization procedure for finding signal constellations resulting in high-performance communications systems. To demonstrate the advantages of our new design method, we report the best constellations found for trellis-coded unitary space\u2013time modulation systems. Simulation results show that these constellations achieve 1 dB coding gain against the usually used constellations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2006.881403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/36086/01710349.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2006.881403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36086","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constellation Design for Trellis-Coded Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constellation Design for Trellis-Coded Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constellation Design for Trellis-Coded Unitary Space\u2013Time Modulation","sourcePdf":"01710349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0266S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","isNumber":"36086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1710349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1710358,"authors":[{"name":"B.-N.

The approach involves modelling the respective collections of targets and measurements as random finite sets and applying the probability hypothesis density (PHD) recursion to propagate the posterior intensity, which is a first-order statistic of the random finite set of targets, in time. At present, there is no closed-form solution to the PHD recursion. This paper shows that under linear, Gaussian assumptions on the target dynamics and birth process, the posterior intensity at any time step is a Gaussian mixture. More importantly, closed-form recursions for propagating the means, covariances, and weights of the constituent Gaussian components of the posterior intensity are derived. The proposed algorithm combines these recursions with a strategy for managing the number of Gaussian components to increase efficiency.

When polled, each remote node transmits its local decision (if any) to the agent, and two network/agent communication schemes are considered. One of these is designed with specific care to the network's energy consumption. In both cases, collisions over the common communication channel are precluded by the sequentiality of the sensors' query. The system performances in terms of average decision time, error probability, and network energy consumption are derived in exact analytical form. A tradeoff exists between the amount and the reliability of the information that the rover may collect: At optimality, the decentralized system overcomes a single supernode by orders of magnitude in terms of decision time, while only 30% of the sensors encountered by the mobile agent spend energy to reveal themselves.

We show that a consensus to the centralized maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate can almost always reached by the sensors for any arbitrary network. We then extend these results in several directions. First, we demonstrate that these results continue to hold with quantization of the messages, which is appealing from the point of view of finite bit rates supportable between links.

The problem is referred to as non-negative source separation and the main application concerns the analysis of spectrometric data sets. The separation is performed in a Bayesian framework by encoding non-negativity through the assignment of Gamma priors on the distributions of both the source signals and the mixing coefficients. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure is proposed to simulate the resulting joint posterior density from which marginal posterior mean estimates of the source signals and mixing coefficients are obtained.

We concentrate on operations that are common in many applications and at the same time devastating to this class of watermarking schemes, namely, amplitude scaling in combination with additive noise. First we derive the probability density function of the watermarked and attacked data in the absence of subtractive dither. Next we extend these models to incorporate subtractive dither in the encoder. The dither sequence is primarily used for security purposes, and the dither is assumed to be known also to the decoder. We design the dither signal statistics such that an attacker having no knowledge of the dither cannot decode the watermark. Using an approximation of the probability density function in the presence of subtractive dither, we derive a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating amplitude scaling factors. Experiments are performed with synthetic and real audio signals, showing the feasibility of the proposed approach under realistic conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude estimation","Watermarking","Additive noise","Maximum likelihood decoding","Lattices","Additive white noise","AWGN","Maximum likelihood estimation","Probability density function","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","maximum likelihood estimation","probability","sequential codes","sequential decoding","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","probability of error","quantization","statistics","subtractive dither","watermarking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","probability of error","quantization","statistics","subtractive dither","watermarking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.881216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/36087/01710362.pdf","startPage":"4146","endPage":"4155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.881216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude Scale Estimation for Quantization-Based Watermarking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude Scale Estimation for Quantization-Based Watermarking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710362/","volume":"54","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1710362/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9140892","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude Scale Estimation for Quantization-Based Watermarking","sourcePdf":"01710362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055255S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"36087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"36087","articleId":"1710362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1710363,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.881199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.881199","startPage":"4311","endPage":"4322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/36087/01710377.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710377/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation","volume":"54","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9140907","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1710377/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation","sourcePdf":"01710377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105847S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"36087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6012","xplore-issue":"36087","articleId":"1710377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":1710378,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

From a networking perspective, we connect data retrieval protocols and different sampling schemes. Specifically, we show that the data retrieval pattern affects the efficiency of reconstruction; as the number of received packets M increases, the deterministic retrieval pattern that schedules sensors to transmit from equally spaced locations results in a faster decay of distortion than the random pattern does. In particular, we show that the ratio of the excess reconstruction distortion under the random retrieval pattern to that under the deterministic one grows as logM+O(loglogM). Comparing the reconstruction performance directly, we further show that, in the high measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the benefit from carefully scheduling sensor transmissions from specific locations instead of collecting in a random fashion is substantial. In the low SNR regime, however, using the random pattern results in little reconstruction performance loss.

After the development of a unified signal model that applies to the different multirate MC-CDMA schemes studied in this paper, a novel space-frequency multiuser detection scheme for multirate uplink MC-CDMA systems with multiple receive antennas is proposed. In particular, a space-frequency minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)-based hybrid serial/parallel interference cancellation receiver (SF-MMSE/HIC) is developed which produces the SF-MMSE combiner as a byproduct. The signal processing of this new detector is jointly carried out in space and frequency domains which leads to the advantage of combating the interference resulting from different sources simultaneously. Based on subspace estimation, a semiblind implementation of the receiver is introduced for slow fading channels. Furthermore, the impact of subcarrier interleaving is investigated for variable spreading factor (VSF) MC-CDMA systems. Based on the characteristic function (CF) of a complex Gaussian random vector (CGRV), a method for analyzing the bit error probability (BEP) performance is presented. Several representative simulation examples of the detector are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed receiver.

We refer to this scheme as the tunable channel decomposition (TCD), which is based on the recently developed generalized triangular decomposition (GTD) algorithm and the closed-form representation of minimum mean-squared-error VBLAST (MMSE-VBLAST) equalizer. The TCD scheme is particularly relevant to the applications where independent data streams with different qualities-of-service (QoS) share the same MIMO channel. The TCD scheme has two implementation forms. One is the combination of a linear precoder and a minimum mean-squared-error VBLAST (MMSE-VBLAST) equalizer, which is referred to as TCD-VBLAST, and the other includes a dirty paper (DP) precoder and a linear equalizer followed by a DP decoder, which we refer to as TCD-DP.

The DOA is modeled as a random variable with prior statistics that describe its level of uncertainty. The Bayesian beamformer is the corresponding minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator, which can be viewed as a mixture of directional beamformers combined according to the posterior distribution of the DOA given the data. Under a deterministic DOA, the mean-square error (MSE) of the Bayesian beamformer becomes as low as that of the directional beamformer equipped with the DOA candidate in the prior set that is the closest to the true DOA at exponential rate, where closeness is defined in the Kullback-Leibler sense. Two efficient algorithms using a uniform linear array (ULA) are presented. The first method utilizes the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compute the posterior distribution on a large number of DOA candidates. The second method approximates the posterior distribution by a Gaussian distribution, which leads to a directional beamformer incorporated with a particular spreading matrix and an adjusted DOA. Numerical simulations show that the proposed beamformer outperforms other related blind or robust beamforming algorithms over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","volume":"54","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"9140917","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1710387/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Beamforming for DOA Uncertainty: Theory and Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Beamforming for DOA Uncertainty: Theory and Implementation","sourcePdf":"01710387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137779S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"36087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"36087","articleId":"1710387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1710388,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These techniques are used in the context of concatenated codes, with Turbo codes as the main example, but are almost never applied to existing classical codes. In this paper, the family of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes is considered, and the complexity problem of soft-in soft-out (SISO) RS decoding is tackled by breaking RS codes into several smaller subcodes. Finally, the decoders of these subcodes work together in a Turbo-like fashion (Gallager's algorithm) to find an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution. The decomposition that is presented here is based on critically subsampled filterbanks, with one subcode in each subband. A critically subsampled filterbank allows us to define a number of parallel independent subcodes. Furthermore, noncritically subsampled filterbanks have a larger number of subband variables than the codeword length, causing a message passing decoder (Gallager's algorithm) to fail. This paper focuses on the construction of such filterbanks, starting from noncritically subsampled filterbanks, it gradually evolves towards a critically subsampled filterbank","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.880047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.880047","startPage":"4446","endPage":"4460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/36087/01710388.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critically Subsampled Filterbanks for SISO Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Critically Subsampled Filterbanks for SISO Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2006","volume":"54","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1710388/","accessionNumber":"9140918","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710388/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critically Subsampled Filterbanks for SISO Reed\u2013Solomon Decoding","sourcePdf":"01710388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076757S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"36087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36087","articleId":"1710388","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1710391,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The fourth generation of wireless communications is expected to integrate a potentially large number of heterogeneous wireless technologies in what could be considered a huge step forward toward universal seamless access. One of the main challenges for seamless mobility is the availability of reliable horizontal (intrasystem) and vertical (intersystem) handoff schemes. Efficient handoff schemes enhance quality of service and provide flawless mobility. This article presents different and novel aspects of handoff and discusses handoff related issues of fourth generation systems. Desirable handoff features are presented. Handoff decisions, radio link transfer, and channel assignment are described as stages of the complete handoff process.

Ideally, channel capacity in independent Rayleigh fading channels scales linearly according to the minimum number of transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) elements. However, in a real indoor environment where a great number of correlated paths exist, this is not exactly true. Therefore, recently many research studies have been focused on measurement, mathematical characterization and numerical simulation of scattering environments. Measurement provides realistic information about the channel; however it requires gathering massive data which is not always possible. Conversely, in most numerical and statistical simulations, channel characteristics are extracted for virtual environments which might not include all realistic aspects of the channel. In this study, ray tracing was used as a tool to model a real indoor scattering environment by considering the details of the study area including shape, size and material","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1710473","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01710473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1710473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of space and angle diversity techniques for indoor MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of space and angle diversity techniques for indoor MIMO system","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710473/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9096161","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1710473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of space and angle diversity techniques for indoor MIMO system","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01710473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058596S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1710473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1710474,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

In particular, it is shown that a double CSD BFWA system operating at frequencies above 10 GHz and under rain fades can be seen as a special case of a 2times2 MIMO system. After pointing out the differences and establishing the exact relationship between the two systems, well-known results available in the MIMO literature were applied for the performance analysis of BFWA diversity systems. This paper particularly looked at the single-user capacity of such a system in both cases that the channel is known and unknown to the transmitter. An interesting outcome of the analysis is that there is no significant capacity gain due to feedback, which further implies that no additional complexity in terms of feedback links is useful to a BFWA diversity system. This can be ascribed to the high correlation of rainfall medium. Furthermore, simulation results have shown that, in case of unbalanced BFWA diversity systems, exclusive power allocation is the optimal choice at low SNR, whereas at high SNR, equal power allocation is the optimal one. This paper hopes that this relationship between the two systems can be used to obtain additional useful insights into the design and analysis of BFWA diversity systems by drawing on the vast body of MIMO literature that is currently available","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of MIMO theory to the analysis of broadband fixed wireless access diversity systems above 10GHz","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1710474","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01710474.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1710474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application of MIMO theory to the analysis of broadband fixed wireless access diversity systems above 10GHz","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1710474/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9086805","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of MIMO theory to the analysis of broadband fixed wireless access diversity systems above 10GHz","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01710474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039637S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1710474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1710475,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.M.

The elements of MRAA, i.e. MRAs presented in this work are capable of dynamically changing the sense of polarization of the radiated field thereby providing two reconfigurable modes of operation, i.e. polarization diversity and space diversity. The transmission signaling scheme can also be switched between transmit diversity (TD) and spatial multiplexing (SM). The results show that the reconfigurable modes of operation of an MRAA used in conjunction with adaptive space-time modulation techniques provide additional degree of freedoms to the current adaptive MIMO systems, thereby resulting in more robust system in terms of quality, capacity and reliability. A substantial performance gain is achievable with the proposed system over conventional fixed antenna MIMO systems depending on the channel conditions","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01710477.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1710477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1710477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1710477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MIMO system equipped with multifunctional reconfigurable antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Samarium","Adaptive systems","Polarization","Antennas and propagation","Adaptive arrays","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Spirals","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","antenna arrays","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","MIMO systems","multiplexing","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","multifunction reconfigurable antenna arrays","radiated field","polarization diversity","space diversity","transmission signaling scheme","transmit diversity","spatial multiplexing","adaptive space-time modulation techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1710477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"A MIMO system equipped with multifunctional reconfigurable antennas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1710477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9086808","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MIMO system equipped with multifunctional reconfigurable antennas","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01710477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032644S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1710477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1710516,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Engheta et. al., (2005) showed that a non-metal nanoparticle can serve as a capacitor whereas a metal nanoparticle can serve as an inductor. This idea is interesting for the design of optical metamaterials, if the proposed nanoparticles are employed to implement the inductive/capacitive blocks in 2-D/3-D negative-refractive-index transmission line (NRI-TL) based metamaterials. Due to the difficulty of adjusting to the inherent numerical intricacies of this problem, simulating plasmonic nanoparticles becomes a challenge for commercial packages. Full-wave analysis through the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) can provide an alternative to them. In this paper, we present the FDTD analysis of a silver nano sphere and compare its field pattern to that of a dielectric nano sphere.

In the first stage a number of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) are trained for detection of the angular sectors which have source or sources. A spatial filter stage applied individually to the every angular sector which is classified in the first stage as having source or sources. Each individual spatial filter is designed to filter out the signals coming from all the other angular sectors outside the particular source detected angular sector. This stage considerably improves the performance of the algorithm in the case where more than one angular sector have source or sources at the same time.

This technique uses matrix pencil (MP) method to compute the direction of arrival (DOA) of the signals using a very efficient computational procedure in which the complexity of the computation can be reduced significantly by using a unitary matrix transformation. This method applies the technique directly to the data without forming a covariance matrix. Using real computations through the unitary transformation for the 2-D matrix pencil method leads to a very efficient computational methodology for real time implementation on a DSP chip. The numerical simulation results are provided to see the performance of the method.

In this method, first, the matrix system of the original 3D problem is reduced to that of 2D layers. Second, the matrix system of 2D layers is further reduced to that of a single layer. Third, a special excitation and extraction technique is proposed to further speed up the analysis. This technique limits the field unknowns needed for the final circuit extraction to those on a single layer only, and hence eliminating the need of recovering field solutions in other layers as well as simplifying the matrix reduction significantly. The entire numerical procedure is rigorous without making any approximation. The computational complexity only involves solving a single layer no matter how large the original problem is. Hence, the proposed method is equipped with a high capacity to solve large-scale IC problems.

By utilizing these tilings in array design it is possible to generate naturally thinned arrays that exhibit broadband properties. We show that by using a genetic algorithm (GA) it is possible to further thin such aperiodic arrays in order to minimize the side-lobe levels (SLL) while simultaneously enhancing the desirable broadband properties.

True time delay lines (TTD) enable squint-free beamforming, since the produced delay is independent of the microwave carrier frequency. Amongst all TTDs, optical delay lines (ODL) possess the highest bandwidth and have strong potential for use in the ultra-wideband systems. Recently, many works have been reported on design and fabrication of photonic crystal delay lines. All of these works, however, have based their delay lines on one dimensional photonic crystal (PC) structures. Therefore achieving longer time delays requires increasing the device size. The objective of this paper is to design a miniaturized TTD which can be used in beamforming network for wideband phased array systems. We propose a novel structure for TTD using total reflection of light in the blocked photonic crystal waveguides (PCW). This novel structure will be referred to here as reflective spiral. It is demonstrated that replacing PCW channels with coupled defects increases the time delay significantly. Using full-wave analysis, it is demonstrated that time delays longer than 8.75 ps can be achieved in a device size less than 20 mum which is 130 times shorter than the required straight distance in free space. The bandwidth of the proposed delay line is more than 2.3 THz.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1711046","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01711046.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1711046","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","startPage":"2279","endPage":"2282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Reflective Spiral Photonic Crystal-Delay Line in Beamforming for Phased Array Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Reflective Spiral Photonic Crystal-Delay Line in Beamforming for Phased Array Antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711046/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711046/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9143418","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Reflective Spiral Photonic Crystal-Delay Line in Beamforming for Phased Array Antennas","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01711046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044206S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1711046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1711048,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA"],"lastName":"Jing Liang","id":"37311152500"},{"name":"H.Y.D.

When the loading elements are small and capacitive, metallic loadings have the effect of reducing patch antenna size with the same center frequency with a slight decrease in bandwidth. When the EBG structure is sufficiently large and resonates at a similar frequency as the patch antenna, the high-impedance surface effect is not seen and the bandwidth actually decreases. This result is due to the similar dimensions of patch antenna and the loading elements","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01711048.pdf","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2290","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1711048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1711048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Proximity Coupled Patch Antenna on a Metalized Substrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patch antennas","Microstrip antennas","Bandwidth","Antenna feeds","Dielectric substrates","Periodic structures","Loaded antennas","Metamaterials","Frequency","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","electromagnetic coupling","microstrip antennas","microstrip lines","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metalized substrate","periodic metallic loading effects","proximity coupled microstrip patch antenna","microstrip line","mushroom-type EBG structure","electromagnetic band gap"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Proximity Coupled Patch Antenna on a Metalized Substrate","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711048/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9143420","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Proximity Coupled Patch Antenna on a Metalized Substrate","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01711048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08665S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1711048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1711054,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This technique differs from other boundary integral techniques in one major way: the FEM solution only serves as the replacement of the closed form Green's function. The formulation in fact is identical to pure MoM. In this method, the original problem are divided into two kinds of regions: the spatially unbounded regions where Green's functions are available but the FEM fails to accurately satisfy the radiation conditions or requires huge computational resource; and the regions with complex geometries where their Green's functions are not available but the FEM can be used to calculate equivalent ones. The separation of the original problem into the two kinds of regions makes the selection of the basis functions for the MoM solutions independent of that for the FEM solutions. It also retains the sparsity and symmetry of the finite element matrix, reducing the storage space and improving computational efficiency.

This formulation is explicit, with a restriction on the time step for stability. When this time step is used in conjunction with the boundary elements forming either an inhomogenous Dirichlet or Neuman boundary condition on the finite-element mesh, late time instabilities occur. To combat this, a unified boundary condition (UBC), for the second-order wave equation, is used. Even when this UBC is used, the late time instabilities are merely delayed if standard testing in time is used. However, the late time instabilities can be removed by replacing centroid based time interpolation with quadrature point based time interpolation for the boundary elements or by sub-cycling the boundary element portion of the formulation.

When structures contain sharp discontinuities or electrically small objects, the FDTD computational region needs to be discretized with fine mesh. If the mesh size is reduced throughout the FDTD computational domain to deal with such a situation, extensive computational resources, such as memory and time, are required. To overcome this problem, the subgridding method for local mesh refinement was proposed to increase the accuracy without increasing the numerical cost significantly. In this paper, interpolation between both electric and magnetic fields around the interface of the main grid (MG) and the local grid (LG) is used to approximate the MG-LG interface fields in the proposed subgridding scheme. As an example, dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) operating in waveguide or free space are studied here by using the proposed subgridding scheme, which enables to tune DRA and the feeding probe dimensions in order to obtain better matching and radiation characteristics. Performance of the 3-D algorithm is validated numerically.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1711178","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01711178.pdf","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1711178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRA Analysis using Simple and Flexible FDTD Subgridding Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711178/","displayDocTitle":"DRA Analysis using Simple and Flexible FDTD Subgridding Scheme","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154813","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711178/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRA Analysis using Simple and Flexible FDTD Subgridding Scheme","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01711178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054554S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1711178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1711180,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

The simulation results show that even at low plasma frequency (6.0 GHz) and with small size of the wire media lens (lambda), the image and the source show excellent agreement","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1711182","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01711182.pdf","startPage":"2783","endPage":"2786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1711182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially Dispersive Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Modelling of Sub-Wavelength Imaging by Wire Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711182/","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Dispersive Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Modelling of Sub-Wavelength Imaging by Wire Media","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9154817","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711182/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Dispersive Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Modelling of Sub-Wavelength Imaging by Wire Media","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01711182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067598S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1711182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1711190,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The principal advantages that this method enjoys over the other predominant differential equation based approach is the fact that one can use unstructured meshes, as well as a space of higher order basis functions. As is well known, the finite element approximation space is usually formulated in terms of polynomials both in space and time. It may be possible to obtain better approximation in space (and possibly in time) by using an approximation that comprises of functions other than polynomials. The generalized finite element method (GFEM) provides the framework for tailoring the function space to a specific problem. However, until recently this technique has been applied only to elliptic problems. We have recently developed a vector basis function that makes this technique applicable to vector electromagnetic problems. In this paper, an extension of the methodology to analyzing time domain phenomena is presented.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2006.1711190","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/11208/36089/01711190.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2006.1711190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36089","startPage":"2813","endPage":"2816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of generalized finite element method for vector electromagnetic problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of generalized finite element method for vector electromagnetic problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711190/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9120958","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1711190/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of generalized finite element method for vector electromagnetic problems","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"01711190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04837S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11208","isNumber":"36089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11208","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36089","articleId":"1711190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1711233,"authors":[{"name":"XiaoPeng Yang","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Japan"],"lastName":"XiaoPeng Yang","id":"37275561200"},{"name":"Qiang Chen","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Japan"],"lastName":"Qiang Chen","id":"37276134800"},{"name":"K.

With the new method, the eigenvector, corresponding to the combination of the desired signal and the coherent interferences, is estimated.

This velocity is a function of propagation distance and the pulse shape. As long as the significant evolution of pulse shape is present due to the numerical noise, the local signal velocity varies continually as the pulse propagates. Pulse shape, in other words the frequency range a pulse occupies, affects the propagation distance at which the pulse dispersion becomes mature.

The performance of the system including synthesized pattern, adaptive weight and bit-error-rate (BER) characteristics are measured for the performance analysis.

After the ignition of this type of lamp, the lamp impedance dramatically drops from an open circuit to a few tens of ohms, which causes the arc in the lamp to extinguish and thus results in ignition failure. This issue will be analyzed from the standpoint of the interactions between different stages in the ballast. For the three-stage electronic ballast, the overall system stability margin can be determined by the impedance-ratio criterion (minor loop gain) between each of the three stages. To simplify the analysis, the DC/AC inverter and the high-intensity-discharge (HID) lamp in the three-stage ballast are modeled together by an equivalent resistance. Therefore, the small-signal model of the three-stage electronic ballast is derived by applying the three-terminal pulse-width modulation (PWM) switch model. Finally, the derived small-signal model is verified by simulations in SIMetrix/SIMPLIS.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1711735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1711735","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01711735.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of the three-stage electronic ballast for metal halide lamp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of the three-stage electronic ballast for metal halide lamp","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711735/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711735/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of the three-stage electronic ballast for metal halide lamp","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043382S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1711751,"authors":[{"name":"Kong Zhi-Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Hei Longjiang, P.R.

First, by examining all possible switching states, switching function models for the capacitor-clamped multilevel converters are derived. Then average models in abc and in dqo coordinates are developed. Furthermore, a small-signal linearization of the model in dqo rotating frame is presented, and a feedback control system is designed. With the help of these models, a novel capacitor voltage balancing method to control the voltage of the flying capacitors is proposed. Eventually, simulation results are provided to validate the proposed models and control system.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1711810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1711810","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01711810.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel modeling and analysis of capacitor-clamped multilevel converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"A novel modeling and analysis of capacitor-clamped multilevel converters","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711810/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711810/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel modeling and analysis of capacitor-clamped multilevel converters","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07613S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1711813,"authors":[{"name":"Pinggang Song","affiliation":["Dept.

This paper reviewed a Space Vector PWM (SVM), which can get rid of the common-mode voltage in multilevel inverters with fundamental switching frequency. But for difficulty of implement SVM algorithm, which requires complex and time-consuming online computation, a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) with four-layer configuration is proposed, which receives angle command and modulation index as input and generate desirable PWM pattern for the three-phase cascaded multilevel inverter. The data derived from simulating of SVM-based scheme is employed to train the proposed ANN with MATLAB/Neural Network Toolbox offline. The performance of the trained ANN-based modulator is investigated in the 11-level cascaded inverters prototype, and the results of the experiment appear to be wonderful that common-mode voltage is reduced drastically and the power semiconductors operate with fundamental switching frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711813/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1711813/","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reduce common-mode voltage in cascaded multilevel inverter based on artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduce common-mode voltage in cascaded multilevel inverter based on artificial neural network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108196S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1711818,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolei Qi","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-tech Cente, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Qi","id":"37086649232"},{"name":"Xinbo Ruan","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-tech Cente, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Xinbo","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37272848800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1711818","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Inverters","Voltage control","RLC circuits","Zero voltage switching","Switches","Inductors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["two-amplitude control","hysteresis control","active clamped","resonant DC link","inverter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711818","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel two-amplitude control strategy for the active clamped resonant DC link inverter By the scheme of the two-amplitude control strategy in conjunction with the dual-loop control strategy, in which the current loop adopts the three-state hysteresis controlled discrete pulse current regulated modulation, it can decrease the DC link losses and reduce the output voltage harmonics.

In addition, it has other benefits such as light weight, low volume and no toxic dielectric coolants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1711874/","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of power electronic transformer for medium voltage levels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of power electronic transformer for medium voltage levels","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033213S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1711919,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Ai-juan","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Ai-juan","id":"38274141500"},{"name":"Li Hang-tian","affiliation":["Guangdong Telecom, Guangzhou Branch, 128 East Tiyu Road, Guangzhou, China, 510620"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Hang-tian"},{"name":"Li Shao-long","affiliation":["Guangdong Telecom, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Shao-long","id":"38335542600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1711919","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":885},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Matrix converters","Power transformers","Circuit faults","Three-dimensional displays","Voltage control"]}],"abstract":"A new three-phase input, three-phase four-wire output, and with a high-frequency AC link matrix type convertor is discussed. The topology of the conventional matrix convertor is modified with an additional high-frequency transformer for three-phase four-wire electronic power distribution application. The proposed approach accomplishes high output voltage transfer ratio which is more than unity, galvanic isolation between both voltage sources and higher power density by employing a high-frequency transformer into the intermediate stage of the dual bridge matrix convertor. It has the same advantages as the conventional matrix convertor, such as bidirectional power flow capability, controllable input power factor and lower harmonic distortion on both input and output sides. Furthermore, with three dimensional space vector PWM (3D SVPWM) and modified control strategy, the input and output currents may keep low harmonic distortion under unbalanced input voltages or variable three-phase four-wire unbalanced loads. The proposed approach is a competitive solution to the electronic power transformer. Experimental results of a three-phase four-wire 220/380V 5KVA 50Hz electronic power transformer system based on DSP controller are presented and shown to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system.","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01711919.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new matrix type three-phase four-wire power electronic transformer","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1711919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1711919","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"A new matrix type three-phase four-wire power electronic transformer","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1711919/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new matrix type three-phase four-wire power electronic transformer","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054759S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1711933,"authors":[{"name":"Xufeng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, CO, U.

In principle, the designed Z-source inverter functions by selectively \u201cshooting through\u201d its power sources, coupled to the inverter using two unique Z-source impedance networks, to boost the inverter three-level output waveform. Proper modulation of the new inverter would therefore require careful integration of the selective shoot-through process to the basic switching concepts to achieve maximal voltage-boost, minimal harmonic distortion, lower semiconductor stress and minimal number of device commutations per switching cycle. To date, the theoretical background on Z-source NPC modulation has not been fully established, and it is the theme of this paper to propose a number of enhanced voltage-boost pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies for controlling the Z-source NPC inverter. While developing the PWM techniques, attention has been devoted to carefully derive them from a common generic basis for improved portability, easier implementation, and most importantly, assisting readers in understanding all concepts that have been presented. The presented strategies are also comparatively evaluated to identify their individual advantages and disadvantages, which are subsequently summarized in a comprehensive reference table.

The second harmonic propagates into different sections of the controller and can have a negative influence on the controller even leading to trip out of the system. This paper proposes a novel Phase-Looked Loop (PLL) algorithm which is able to filter out the negative sequence and to provide a clean synchronization signal. Along with the conventional PI controller in the PLL structure, the proposed algorithm employs a repetitive controller to deal with the second harmonic. The purpose of the repetitive controller is to amplify the second harmonic in the reference of the PI controller, so that this can be better rejected. Simulation and experimental results are used to validate the robustness of the proposed system when running on grid faults.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1711963","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01711963.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1711963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"PLL algorithm for power generation systems robust to grid voltage faults","htmlLink":"/document/1711963/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711963/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PLL algorithm for power generation systems robust to grid voltage faults","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041748S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1711968,"authors":[{"name":"Xinhui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xinhui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407325800"},{"name":"Sanjib K.

A simple graphical representation is used to explain how the NP currents of the different phases combine in a multiphase converter. New modulation schemes are proposed and their impact in the NP current is demonstrated. The current that can be injected when needed is maximized. A new NP control scheme without using the common mode (CM) voltage is introduced. Experiments confirm that the NP voltage can be controlled by the dynamic application of the different modulation types, even if there is a static CM applied to the output voltage.

Hence a power electronic inverter is required to condition this output into a more conventional constant magnitude AC supply voltage. Such an inverter should be light weight, low cost, efficient, and provide galvanic isolation between the source and the AC output/grid connection. It is also often preferable that the inverter draws constant DC current from the input energy source, which means it must smooth out the double-fundamental-frequency energy flow of a single phase AC load connection. These requirements can be met with a double conversion system incorporating a high frequency DC-DC step up converter to produce a relatively constant high voltage DC output from the varying DC input, and a high voltage DC-AC inverter and filter to produce the final AC output. This paper describes the winning entry inverter developed by the Monash University FEC undergraduate team for the 2005 IEEE Future Energy Challenge to meet these requirements. The specifications for the inverter were quite challenging in terms of input voltage range, efficiency, volume weight and cost. Design details, innovations, and simulation and experimental results are included in the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1711987/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1711987/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"An innovative, efficient current-fed push-pull grid connectable inverter for distributed generation systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An innovative, efficient current-fed push-pull grid connectable inverter for distributed generation systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01711987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048879S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1711987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1711988,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai Ciobotaru","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg, DENMARK"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Ciobotaru","id":"37288173500"},{"name":"Remus Teodorescu","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg, DENMARK"],"firstName":"Remus","lastName":"Teodorescu","id":"37276254200"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Institute of Energy Technology, Aalborg, DENMARK"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1711988","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":453,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Resonant frequency","Periodic structures","Filtering","Frequency estimation","Inverters","Standards"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1711988","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01711988.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1711988","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1711988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new single-phase PLL structure based on second order generalized integrator","abstract":"Phase, amplitude and frequency of the utility voltage are critical information for the operation of the grid-connected inverter systems.

The novelty consists in generating the orthogonal voltage system using a structure based on second order generalized integrator (SOGI). The proposed structure has the following advantages: \u2014 it has a simple implementation; \u2014 the generated orthogonal system is filtered without delay by the same structure due to its resonance at the fundamental frequency, \u2014 the proposed structure is not affected by the frequency changes.

Instead of designing the controller in frequency domain, a time-domain boundary control method for large-signal control of boost converters will be presented in this paper. By transforming the state plane into a state-energy plane to dictate the switching instants, a well-defined switching surface is derived. The converter has good output regulation, as well as good dynamic behaviors. The converter can revert to the steady state in two switching actions during the external disturbances. Of particular importance, the same controller is applicable for converter operating in all three modes, including continuous conduction mode, critical conduction mode, and discontinuous conduction mode.

The tool include many different suitable topologies for the aforementioned power systems. In each different topology, the user can select among types of loads: resistive, inductive, capacitive and combinations. Firing angles and modulation schemes can also be selected to show different behavior of the topologies. Some values are selected by introducing the desired value, and remain fixed during simulations while other values can be dynamically adjusted with sliding rules during simulations. During the simulation the circulating current direction and the state of semiconductor switches is shown, by means of changing colors. The multimedia system includes documentation on all the subjects, showing basic concepts and equations, in pdf format and links to industrial manufacturers. One of the main contributions is that all the system is in Spanish language, becoming useful for classroom and laboratories duties without the need of translation. Once finished with the simulations, the students can auto evaluate themselves with an automated test set. This feature helps the students to establish the knowledge level acquired after employing the multimedia tool.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712043","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712043.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"E-learning system for power electronics converters","htmlLink":"/document/1712043/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712043/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E-learning system for power electronics converters","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046407S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1712059,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Accurate and fast detection of this voltage component under grid faults is essential to keep the control over the power exchange with the grid avoiding to trip the converter protections and allowing the ride-through of the transient fault. In this paper, the systematic use of well known techniques conducts to a new positive-sequence voltage detection system which exhibits a fast, precise, and frequency-adaptive response under faulty grid conditions. Three fundamental functional blocks make up the proposed detector, these are: i) the quadrature-signals generator (QSG), ii) the positive-sequence calculator (PSC), and iii) the phase-locked loop (PLL). A key innovation of the proposed system is the use of a dual second order generalized integrator (DSOGI) to implement the QSG. For this reason, the proposed positive-sequence detector is called DSOGI-PLL. A detailed study of the DSOGI-PLL and verification by simulation are performed in this paper. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that the DSOGI-PLL is a very suitable technique for characterizing the positive-sequence voltage under grid faults.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New positive-sequence voltage detector for grid synchronization of power converters under faulty grid conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Harmonic analysis","Wind power generation","Resonant frequency","Detectors","Transient analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"New positive-sequence voltage detector for grid synchronization of power converters under faulty grid conditions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1712059/","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New positive-sequence voltage detector for grid synchronization of power converters under faulty grid conditions","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094491S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"305","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1712073,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqiao Shen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Yugu Lu, Hangzhou, P.

Implemented at medium voltage level, the DVR can be used to protect a group of medium voltage or low voltage consumers. With the implementation at medium voltage level the DVR would also suffer from faults those involving downstream loads. Large fault currents would flow through the DVR during a downstream fault before the opening of a circuit breaker. Large fault currents will cause the voltage at Point of Common Coupling (PCC) to drop, which would affect the loads on the other parallel feeders connected to PCC. Furthermore, if not controlled properly, the DVR might also contribute to this PCC voltage sag in the process of compensating the missing voltage thus further worsening the fault situation. To limit the flow of large line currents, and therefore restore the PCC voltage as well as protect the DVR system components, a downstream fault limiting function is proposed and integrated in the DVR operation. A flux-charge-model feedback algorithm is implemented so that the DVR would act as a large virtual inductance in series with the distribution feeder in fault situations. Controlling the DVR as a virtual inductor would also ensure zero real power absorption during the DVR compensation and thus minimize the stress in the DC link. Finally the proposed fault current limiting algorithm has been tested experimentally on a medium voltage level DVR system with symmetrical and unsymmetrical downstream fault conditions with the results verifying the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for limiting the downstream fault conditions.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712084","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual-functional medium voltage level DVR to limit downstream fault currents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dual-functional medium voltage level DVR to limit downstream fault currents","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712084/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/1712084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual-functional medium voltage level DVR to limit downstream fault currents","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06625S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1712088,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Then the disturbance voltage is estimated by subtracting the constructed voltage model from the current controller output. The proposed method compensates all of the inverter nonlinearity factors at the same time and all the processes in estimating distortions are independent of the dead time and power device parameters.

A typical application is for fuel cell vehicles where a bi-directional interface between a 12V battery and a high voltage DC bus is required. The battery side voltage ranges from 11V to 16V while the fuel cell is operated between 220V and 447V and the required power is typically 1kW. Careful analysis shows that the high currents on the battery side cause significant design issues in order to obtain a high efficiency. The standard phase shift modulation method can result in high conduction and switching losses. This paper proposes a combined triangular and trapezoidal modulation method to reduce losses over the wide operating range. Approximately, a 2% improvement in efficiency can be expected. An experimental system is used to verify the improved performance of the dual active bridge using the proposed advanced modulation method.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712096","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance optimization of a high current dual active bridge with a wide operating voltage range","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance optimization of a high current dual active bridge with a wide operating voltage range","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712096/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/1712096/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance optimization of a high current dual active bridge with a wide operating voltage range","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044139S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1712097,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Du","affiliation":["Semiconductor Power Electronics Center North Carolina State University Raleigh, NC"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Du","id":"37275785600"},{"name":"Leon M.

Traditionally, each phase of a three-phase cascaded multilevel converter requires n DC sources for 2n + 1 output voltage levels. In this paper, a scheme is proposed that allows the use of a single DC source as the first DC source with the remaining n \u2212 1 DC sources being capacitors. It is shown that a simple 7-level equal step output voltage switching control can simultaneously maintain the balance of DC voltage levels of the capacitors, eliminate specified low order non-triplen harmonics, and produce a nearly sinusoidal three-phase output voltage. This scheme therefore provides the capability to produce higher voltages at higher speeds (where they are needed) with a low switching frequency method for motor drive application, which has inherent low switching losses and high conversion efficiency. This control scheme especially fits fuel cell electric vehicle motor drive applications and hybrid electric vehicle motor drive applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid cascaded H-bridges multilevel motor drive control for electric vehicles","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712097","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712097.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid cascaded H-bridges multilevel motor drive control for electric vehicles","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1712097/","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid cascaded H-bridges multilevel motor drive control for electric vehicles","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079061S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1712106,"authors":[{"name":"Zahirrudin Idris","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zahirrudin","lastName":"Idris","id":"37294017900"},{"name":"Mustafar Kamal Hamzah","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mustafar Kamal","lastName":"Hamzah","id":"37293969300"},{"name":"Mohamad Fadzil Saidon","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamad Fadzil","lastName":"Saidon","id":"37086744852"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1712106","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Pulse width modulation","AC-AC converters","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Frequency conversion","Switching circuits","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM)","Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)","Single-Phase Matrix Converter (SPMC)","Direct AC-AC Converters","Commutation Strategies"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned on investigations in implementations of the Single-Phase Matrix Converter (SPMC) as a direct AC-AC converter subjected to passive load conditions.

Design considerations are treated in the context of a dc-dc converter operating at a switching frequency of 100 MHz. Gate drive, rectifier and control designs are explored in detail, and experimental measurements of the complete converter are presented that verify the design approach. The gate drive, a self-oscillating multi-resonant circuit, dramatically reduces the gating power while ensuring fast on-off transitions of the semiconductor switch. The rectifier is a resonant topology that absorbs diode parasitic capacitance and is designed to appear resistive at the switching frequency. The small sizes of the energy storage elements (inductors and capacitors) in this circuit permit rapid start-up and shut-down and a correspondingly high control bandwidth. These characteristics are exploited in a high bandwidth hysteretic control scheme that modulates the converter on and off at frequencies as high as 200 kHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712114.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for very high frequency dc-dc converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","DC-DC power converters","Switching frequency","Switches","Radio frequency","Capacitance","Resonant frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for very high frequency dc-dc converters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1712114/","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for very high frequency dc-dc converters","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070884S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1712132,"authors":[{"name":"L.

An additional bandwidth limitation comes from the operation of the digital pulse width modulator (DPWM). When employed in a sampled data system, PWM modulation introduces additional phase lag in the control loop, which turns out to be dependent on the steady-state duty cycle. Multiple sampling technique seems promising in reducing the sampling and modulator phase lag and ultimately achieving higher control bandwidth. In this paper the multiple sampling concept and analytical modeling are discussed, as well as the major drawbacks that come from the increased sampling frequency. Some provisions for the elimination of the state variable ripple are also proposed.

Without limiting the heat, which is proportional to the square of the circulating current, the fault generally develops into catastrophic phase. In this paper, it is shown that the circulating current in the shorted turns is strongly related to the stator line-neutral voltage. Also, it is observed that with an appropriate adjustment to the rotating magnetic flux, the stator line-neutral voltage can be reduced, resulting in a significant reduction in the circulating current. Based on these principles, a stator turn fault tolerant strategy for IM drives is proposed. This strategy does not require any change in the standard drive configuration and most importantly, does not result in the complete loss of availability of an IM drive in the presence of a stator turn fault. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stator windings","Rotors","Windings","Circuit faults","Inductance","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Stator turn fault","Safety critical application"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712150","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712150.pdf","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stator turn fault tolerant strategy for induction motor drives in safety critical applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A stator turn fault tolerant strategy for induction motor drives in safety critical applications","publicationDate":"June 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/1712150/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stator turn fault tolerant strategy for induction motor drives in safety critical applications","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03556S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1712188,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Yousefzadeh","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Yousefzadeh","id":"37301191300"},{"name":"Eduard Alarcon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Alarcon","id":"37274243200"},{"name":"Dragan Maksimovi\u0107","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Maksimovi\u0107","id":"37085810156"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1712188","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":600},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Transfer functions","Power amplifiers","Low pass filters","Bandwidth","Maximum likelihood detection","Nonlinear filters"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Band separation and efficiency optimization in linear-assisted switching power amplifiers","abstract":"Linear-assisted switching power amplifiers are based on combinations of switching converters (for high efficiency) and linear amplifiers (for high-speed, wide bandwidth responses) in applications such as envelope tracking for RF power amplifiers in polar modulation architectures, or audio amplifiers.

Such multi-phase motor drives are nowadays considered for various applications. Multi-phase drives are invariably supplied from multi-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs) and adequate methods for VSI pulse width modulation (PWM) are therefore required. This paper deals with carrier-based PWM, where harmonic injection enables an improvement in the dc bus utilisation without moving into the over-modulation region, while still providing sinusoidal output phase voltages.

The viability of the proposed concept is proved by simulation taking five-phase VSI as an example. The method of fifth-harmonic injection in five-phase VSIs enables operation with pure sinusoidal voltages up to a certain reference voltage value which is smaller than the maximum achievable with the given dc link voltage. Sinusoidal PWM is further modified, by injecting other harmonics, in order to enable full utilisation of the dc bus voltage. The correlation of this PWM scheme with space vector PWM, based on utilisation of large vectors only, is established in this way. Some experimental results, illustrating application of the sinusoidal PWM in series-connected five-phase two-motor drives, are included.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712206","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712206","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712206.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712206/","displayDocTitle":"Generalised sinusoidal PWM with harmonic injection for multi-phase VSIs","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/1712206/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalised sinusoidal PWM with harmonic injection for multi-phase VSIs","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046426S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":1712211,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-Shin Kwak","affiliation":["Seoul National University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwanak-gu, Seoul"],"firstName":"Mu-Shin","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37270131000"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Seoul National University School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Gwanak-gu, Seoul"],"firstName":"Seung-Ki","lastName":"Sul","id":"37085453864"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1712211","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Topology","Generators","Inverters","Power conversion","Control systems","Inductors"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the optimal load sharing control method of grid connected gas engine generation system.

In this paper, a method of remote area wind energy harvesting is presented, with a focus on an anemometer-based solution. By utilizing the motion of the anemometer shaft to turn a compact alternator, small amounts of power can be harvested from otherwise unavailable sources. Energy harvested is converted to battery potential via a pulsed buck-boost converter operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). It is found that maintaining a constant input resistance at the input port of the converter biases the alternator to operate at its peak power point over a wide range of wind speeds. Results show that power harvesting capability using the discussed alternator and power converter solution are in the range of tens to hundreds of microwatts up to approximately one milliwatt. This power is passed to the central system batteries, providing a trickle-charge. As a result, sensor nodes incorporating this harvesting solution have an increased field lifetime. High overall efficiency is maintained over a wide range of potential wind speeds, with little impact on anemometer measurement accuracy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712213.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote area wind energy harvesting for low-power autonomous sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1712213/","displayDocTitle":"Remote area wind energy harvesting for low-power autonomous sensors","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote area wind energy harvesting for low-power autonomous sensors","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038119S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1712223,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua W.

Though lumped line-simulating networks are often preferred to their distributed exemplars for reasons of design flexibility and manufacturability, the impedance peaks and nulls of such lumped networks must be aligned in a precise, harmonic manner to minimize loss and symmetrize converter waveforms. This paper addresses the issue of harmonic frequency alignment in line-simulating networks, presenting new analytic results for predicting the impedance-minimum and -maximum frequencies of networks in a ladder form. Two means of correcting for the observed harmonic misalignment in practical structures will be presented, corroborated by measurements of laminar structures built into the thickness of printed-circuit boards. These structures comprise inductances and capacitances whose dimensions are largely decoupled, such that the simulated line can be accurately analyzed and designed on a lumped basis. The presented techniques will be placed within a power-electronics setting by a representative application incorporating a lumped, line-simulating network.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712223.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of lumped transmission-line analogs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Frequency measurement","Poles and zeros","Harmonic analysis","Transmission line measurements","Power transmission lines","Couplings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of lumped transmission-line analogs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712223/","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1712223/","publicationDate":"June 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of lumped transmission-line analogs","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061509S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1712225,"authors":[{"name":"John S.

It was reported that the deadbeat control method with FPGA based hardware controller had the very good transient response for various loads, but these reports were mainly focused on a few KW class PWM inverter system, so the high carrier frequency were adopted. But in MW class PWM inverter system, the carrier frequency is limited upto 2kHz range, because of the performance of the switching devices and the trade off against the efficiency of the inverter. In this condition, the controllability of the PWM inverter is not so much expected and still the conventional PI control method is widely used. Five different digital control methods (1. singlerate deadbeat control, 2. multirate deadbeat control, 3. multirate 2 degree of freedom deadbeat control, 4. quasi multirate deadbeat control, 5. quasi multirate 2 degree of freedom deadbeat control) are verified to clarify the possibility to improve the control characteristics in a low carrier-frequency PWM inverter system. Simulations were carried out in case of 20kHz carrier and in case of 2kHz carrier, for each control method, also the robustness to the filter parameter variations was investigated. As a result, the advantages of the proposed control methods were verifled.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of FPGA based digital control method for low carrier-frequency PWM inverter","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712233","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712233.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of FPGA based digital control method for low carrier-frequency PWM inverter","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1712233/","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of FPGA based digital control method for low carrier-frequency PWM inverter","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099214S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1712244,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Trescases","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Trescases","id":"37284084400"},{"name":"Guowen Wei","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Guowen","lastName":"Wei","id":"37579334200"},{"name":"Wai Tung Ng","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Wai Tung","lastName":"Ng","id":"37270353700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1712244","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1058},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching frequency","Clocks","Modulation","Delays","Electromagnetic interference","Switched mode power supplies","Time-frequency analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power DC-DC converter with digital spread spectrum for reduced EMI","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712244","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712244.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712244","abstract":"This paper presents a 1.8 V step-down DC-DC converter prototype with a hybrid delay-line based digital pulse-width modulator. A spread spectrum clock generation scheme is demonstrated for reducing EMI. The switching frequency of the buck converter prototype is automatically varied from 1.74 MHz to 2.84 MHz in 128 steps using a pseudo-random 512 cycle pattern, resulting in a 23 dB reduction in the conducted EMI peak. The digital pseudo-random pattern is converted to an analog reference voltage using a low-cost one-bit delta-sigma DAC having an over-sampling rate of 4096. The DAC output modulates the reference voltage of an LDO that regulates the delay-line supply voltage. It is shown that the effective duty-cycle changes by only 0.27 % over the frequency range. With spread spectrum mode enabled, the inductor current ripple becomes time-dependent but the efficiency degrades by less than 0.1%. The proposed architecture can be applied to a wide variety of state-of-the-art digital controllers that rely on delay-line based pulse width modulators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1712244/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"A low-power DC-DC converter with digital spread spectrum for reduced EMI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power DC-DC converter with digital spread spectrum for reduced EMI","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070031S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1712246,"authors":[{"name":"Surin Khomfoi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Surin","lastName":"Khomfoi","id":"37301115200"},{"name":"Leon M.

It is difficult to diagnose a multilevel-inverter drive (MLID) system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of a MLID system. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults from inverter output voltage measurement. The neural network design process is clearly described. The principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce the neural network input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train a neural network, and the reduced noise may improve the mapping performance. The comparison between MLP neural network (NN) and PC neural network (PC-NN) are performed. Both proposed networks are evaluated with simulation test set and experimental test set. The PC-NN has improved overall classification performance from NN by about 5% points. The overall classification performance of the proposed networks is more than 90%. Thus, by utilizing the proposed neural network fault diagnosis system, a better understanding about fault behaviors, diagnostics, and detections of a multilevel inverter drive system can be accomplished. The results of this analysis are identified in percentage tabular form of faults and switch locations.","doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712246","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712246.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault diagnosis system for a multilevel inverter using a principal component neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Inverters","Circuit faults","Neural networks","Principal component analysis","Switches","Induction motors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","multilevel inverter","principal component","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis system for a multilevel inverter using a principal component neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1712246/","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis system for a multilevel inverter using a principal component neural network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074081S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1712250,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Kakigano","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electoronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Kakigano","id":"37541320400"},{"name":"Yushi Miura","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electoronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yushi","lastName":"Miura","id":"37402719700"},{"name":"Toshifumi Ise","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electoronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshifumi","lastName":"Ise","id":"37273766600"},{"name":"Ryohei Uchida","affiliation":["Division of Electrical, Electoronic and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryohei","lastName":"Uchida","id":"37273760900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1712250","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4874},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712250","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Rectifiers","Engines","Batteries","Distributed power generation","Cogeneration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["micro-grid","distributed generation","dc distribution","high quality power","intentional isolation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/pesc.2006.1712250","publicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/11209/36090/01712250.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/pesc.2006.1712250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC micro-grid for super high quality distribution \u2014 System configuration and control of distributed generations and energy storage devices","abstract":"\u201cDC micro-grid\u201d is the novel power system using dc distribution in order to provide super high quality power.

By aligning the inverter switching frequency just below the line's \u03bb/4-wave resonance, the Class \u03a6 topology enforces odd-and even-harmonic content in its drain voltage and input current, respectively. The symmetrizing action of the transmission-line dynamics results in natural square-wave operation of the switch, reducing the inverter stresses (relative to a Class E) for a given power throughput. The inverter waveforms and normalized power-output capability are analyzed in simple terms, and supported by measurements of an inverter built around a length of distributed line, and an inverter incorporating a lumped L-C ladder network. The latter implementation is constructed with air-core magnetics and inter-layer capacitances that are integrated into the thickness of a printed-circuit board. A comparison with a Class \u0395 inverter of similar size and ratings demonstrates the small passive-component values and manufacturing advantages afforded by the Class \u03a6 topology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/1712260/","conferenceDate":"18-22 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Radio-frequency inverters with transmission-line input networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio-frequency inverters with transmission-line input networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"01712260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098266S","chronDate":"18-22 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11209","isNumber":"36090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11209","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"36090","articleId":"1712260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1712261,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Fujii","affiliation":["TOKYO DENKI UNIVERSITY, Hiki-gun, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37693260600"},{"name":"Tomoki Yokoyama","affiliation":["TOKYO DENKI UNIVERSITY, Hiki-gun, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Yokoyama","id":"37275594700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9716-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"1712261","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Steady-state","Inverters","Pulse width modulation","Load modeling","Mathematical model","Hardware"]}],"abstract":"A new approach for real time digital feedback control of PWM inverter is proposed, in which a deadbeat control combined with disturbance compensator and multi sampling method using FPGA based hardware controller.

adaptive arrays are applied to practical problems, the performance degradation of adaptive beamforming techniques may become even more pronounced than in the ideal case because some of underlying assumptions on the environment, sources, or sensor array can be violated and this may cause a mismatch between the presumed and actual signal steering vectors. In the practical environment, complete knowledge of signal characteristics is not available and the environment is time varying. In these cases, the recursive algorithms to robust adaptive beamforming are required. In this paper, we propose robust constrained-LMS algorithm based on constrained-LMS algorithm and explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response, which belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches. Our proposed robust constrained-LMS algorithm provides excellent robustness against the signal steering vector mismatches, enhances the array system performance under nonideal conditions and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one.

Conventional neural network methods suffer from limitations, which make them less than adequate for decision making in dynamic business environment. In order to reduce the input nodes, the factors that affect the business forecasting are standardized firstly. Then they are reduced using the principle components analysis method. For hidden nodes, their number is firstly limited to less than the square root of product of input nodes number and output nodes number. Then the correlation coefficients between different hidden nodes in same layer are calculated. Lastly the hidden nodes are merged or deleted according to correlation coefficients. The structure of Improved Bp Neural Network (IBNN) is optimized by above method. The result of the business forecasting using the IBNN is shown to be satisfying.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2006.1712854","startPage":"2700","endPage":"2704","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/11210/36091/01712854.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2006.1712854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an Improved BP Neural Network in Business Forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Biological neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Artificial intelligence","Feedforward neural networks","Decision making","Optimization methods","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","business data processing","forecasting theory","neural nets","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network","business forecasting","Principle components","Correlation","Scatter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP neural network","business forecasting","Principle components","Correlation","Scatter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Application of an Improved BP Neural Network in Business Forecasting","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1712854/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9163475","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an Improved BP Neural Network in Business Forecasting","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01712854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053292S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36091","articleId":"1712854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1712855,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Duan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Ping Duan","id":"37087545849"},{"name":"Chengjun Ding","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Chengjun Ding","id":"37087545191"},{"name":"Minglu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Minglu Zhang","id":"37087299161"},{"name":"Genqun Cui","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Genqun Cui","id":"37087544108"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1712855","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent control","Neural networks","Manipulators","Intelligent networks","Intelligent vehicles","Mechanical engineering","Electronic mail","Fault tolerant systems","Torque control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","fault tolerance","intelligent control","manipulators","mobile robots","motion control","neurocontrollers","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile manipulator","neural network","coordination control","nonholonomic constraints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile manipulator","neural network","coordination control","nonholonomic constraints"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712855","abstract":"Neural network has some characters, such as distributed storing information, parallel disposing data, self- organization and self-studying.

According to the change on decision attribute support as increasing and decreasing of attributes, the minimum reduction of attributes for each classification decision is obtained. The minimum reduction of attributes is used to guide the BPNN structure design. And the structure of BPNN is optimized.

Most of the present navigation systems rely on Kalman filtering methods to fuse data. Present Kalman filtering SINS/GPS integration techniques have several inadequacies related to sensor error model, immunity to noise and observability. This paper aims at introducing a novel SINS/GPS integration algorithm utilizing Hopfield neural network. This method obtains the optimal state estimation by minimizing the energy function of the Hopfield neural network. Furthermore this algorithm relaxes the assumptions made by the Kalman filter so that it is more versatile. Simulation results show that the new integration algorithm performs similarly to the Kalman filter. Furthermore it has some advantages such as fast convergence, unbias and high precision during fusion process, despite of the inaccurate modeling errors, system disturbance, observation errors, and even the shortage of observation. Also as the parallel computational mode and easily carried out in hardware of the Hopfield neural network, this integration algorithm can improve the navigation guidance accuracy, real time ability and practicability of the SINS/GPS.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2006.1712910","startPage":"2969","endPage":"2973","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/11210/36091/01712910.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2006.1712910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel SINS/GPS Integration Algorithm Based on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon compounds","Global Positioning System","Neural networks","Navigation","Hopfield neural networks","Kalman filters","Filtering","Fuses","Observability","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Hopfield neural nets","Kalman filters","radionavigation","sensor fusion","state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SINS","GPS","Integration Algorithm","State Estimation","Hopfield Neural Network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SINS","GPS","Integration Algorithm","State Estimation","Hopfield Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1712910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Novel SINS/GPS Integration Algorithm Based on Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9187731","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel SINS/GPS Integration Algorithm Based on Neural Networks","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01712910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038107S","chronDate":"0-0  0","isNumber":"36091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","articleId":"1712910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1712912,"authors":[{"name":"Jianyang Xie","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jianyang Xie","id":"37087397891"},{"name":"Xianglong Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xianglong Tang","id":"37087397932"},{"name":"Tiecai Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Tiecai Li","id":"37087161116"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1712912","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1712912","abstract":"Power consumption is a key issue in high-performance interconnection network design. In interconnection network, power consumption of interconnection links will take up an ever larger portion of the power budget as demand for network bandwidth increases. Network traffic is an important factor that influences interconnection network power consumption. In this paper, we presented a traffic forecasting model using neural network method. Our interconnection network traffic forecasting model based on neural network adopted Back-Propagation learning algorithm and divided network period of time into two parts: stationary-hours and non-stationary-hours. Then we proposed voltage scaling algorithm for links based on our forecasting model.

Modified PSO by tracking best feasible particle can not facilitate particles exploring unknown feasible region from known infeasible region, so the global exploration ability is greatly limited. Therefore, finding better unknown feasible solution by flying through infeasible region is critical to the performance of PSO. This paper proposes master-slave particle swarm optimization (MSPSO), a novel approach for solving constrained optimization problems, in which particles in master swarm fly toward better feasible particles, particles in slave swarm fly toward better infeasible particles, and particles in two swarms help each other flying by sharing information of better feasible and infeasible particles. The proposed algorithm was tested on 11 benchmark constrained optimization problems. The test results show that MSPSO can significantly improve the globe exploration ability and effectively avoid being trapped into local optimum.

Unfortunately, the secondary protein structures are hard to get from experimental analysis, and most researchers usually use predictive information instead of real structures. However, we want to look at the natures of protein secondary structures rather than putting too much focus on current approaches to protein secondary structure prediction. For the regularity of secondary protein structures, we define a schema and adopt an approach of evolutionary computation. The approach combines a clustering method and genetic algorithms to produce the schemata for the visible natures of protein secondary structures. There are two major roles of clustering algorithm, one is to generate part of the initial chromosomes in the genetic algorithms and the other is to assist schemata in predicting secondary protein structures. By performing the new approach, the accuracy of Q3 can be improved 12% more than the previous researches.

The classical FARIMA processes cannot capture non-Gaussian, namely heavy tailness that is the key factor of the burstiness of self-similar traffic. We present a novel FARIMA predictor with \u03b1-stable innovations based on a new non-Gaussian self-similar traffic model. A FARIMA process can be regarded as ARMA process driven by fractional differencing process. ARMA processes with infinite variance can be simulated with recurrent neural network (RNN) instead of conventional Least Squares methods. To train the weights of RNN, we adopt two methods including the conventional back-propagation algorithm and the hybrid method with genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm. The two weights training approaches can minimize the dispersion. The final predicted values of the self-similar traffic are attained by combining the previous two individual FARIMA predicted values with the different hybrid schemes. Our experimental results for the traffic trace collected from Bellcore Lab and Lawrence Berkeley Lab show that the two FARIMA predictors are efficient, the compound predictors are more accurate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1713171/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1713171/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9187854","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Prediction for Non-Gaussian Self-Similar Traffic with Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction for Non-Gaussian Self-Similar Traffic with Neural Network","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01713171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.154711S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","xplore-issue":"36091","articleId":"1713171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1713177,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Bai","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Meng Bai","id":"37852569900"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Zhao","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoguang Zhao","id":"37406840100"},{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zeng-Guang Hou","id":"37279945000"},{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Min Tan","id":"37066512400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1713177","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Automation","Immune system","Laboratories","Intelligent systems","Failure analysis","Pattern analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Intelligent control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified negative selection","anomaly detection","immune system","foreign pattern detection","abnormal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["negative selection","immune system","abnormal detection"]}],"abstract":"A novel negative selection algorithm is presented, which is inspired by the negative selection mechanism of the immune system that can detect foreign patterns in the complement (nonself) space.

The FPGA based ASIC has functions of closed current loop control, closed position/velocity loop control, incremental encoder logic, PWM modulation, fault/brake logic, velocity estimator, host communication module, UART module and Delta-Sigma analog to digital converter. The hardware system executes quickly in dedicated parallel hardware without timing overhead penalty of a serial processor. The update rates of the current control loop and position/velocity control loop are 120 kHz and 20 kHz, respectively. The new designed ASIC can be incorporated with a general-purpose microcontroller or DSP to provide a simple, compact, low-cost, and effective solution for high-performance motion control. An adaptive control algorithm is implemented in the new designed system in order to control a SCARA robotic manipulator. In order to increase the sampling frequency of the system when using model based control algorithm, the control algorithm is partitioned into a linear portion and a nonlinear portion. The linear portion with position/velocity feedback represents the major control loop and is implemented in the FPGA based ASIC. The nonlinear portion acts as dynamic compensation to the linear portion to perform complex modeling related calculations, and is implemented in the DSP. Experimental results demonstrate that the new proposed system is successful and it exhibits much improved motion performance especially during high-speed motions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of an FPGA-Based Motion Control ASIC for Robotic Manipulators","publicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713577","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/11210/36092/01713577.pdf","startPage":"8221","endPage":"8225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1713577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1713577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Development of an FPGA-Based Motion Control ASIC for Robotic Manipulators","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1713577/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9062801","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an FPGA-Based Motion Control ASIC for Robotic Manipulators","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01713577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06068S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"36092","articleId":"1713577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1713588,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Information and Automation, Chongqing Institute of Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Shan Li","id":"37087283859"},{"name":"Jinhua Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan"],"lastName":"Jinhua Li","id":"37087371269"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1713588","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Servomotors","Servomechanisms","Neural networks","Automatic control","Three-term control","Nonlinear control systems","Error correction","Torque","Position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","neurocontrollers","servomotors","three-term control","ultrasonic motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ultra-Sonic motor","IMC-PID","Servo system","Neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra-Sonic motor","IMC-PID","Servo system","Neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1713588","abstract":"Aimed at Ultra-Sonic Motor (USM) has non-linear input-output characteristics and the control parameters of conventional Internal Model Control (IMC) cannot adjust automatically, an Neural Network (NN) is employed to tune the parameter of the IMC-PID control.

Simulation results show that CM EMI suppression based on simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) can regulate the phase of compensating current accurately without getting trapped at local minimums, suppress CM noise level effectively, and improve the EMC performance of power electronic products.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713626","startPage":"8448","endPage":"8452","publicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36092","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/11210/36092/01713626.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common Mode EMI Suppression Based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1713626/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Common Mode EMI Suppression Based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1713626/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9062826","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common Mode EMI Suppression Based on Simulated Annealing Algorithm","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01713626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112488S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36092","articleId":"1713626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1713634,"authors":[{"name":"Yongtao Liao","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yongtao Liao","id":"37087371571"},{"name":"Cunbao Ma","affiliation":["School of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Cunbao Ma","id":"37087220348"},{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Chao Zhang","id":"37087148445"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1713634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Risk management","Risk analysis","Information security","Data security","National security","Fuzzy set theory","Technological innovation","Arithmetic","Chaos","Mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","fuzzy set theory","risk analysis","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy similarity measure","network security risk analysis","information security","generalized fuzzy numbers","fuzzy risk analysis","center-of-gravity","hierarchical fuzzy risk assessment","fuzzy weighted average method","hierarchical security structures","linguistic approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network security","risk analysis","linguistic approximation","similarity measure","generalized fuzzy numbers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1713634","abstract":"Network security risk analysis is a crucial technique in network and information security.

Experiment results show that AMOPSO has a higher convergence speed and better exploratory capabilities than MOPSO, and that the approach to image fusion based on AMOPSO realizes the Pareto optimal image fusion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1713934/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9062955","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1713934/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Image Fusion Based on Multi-Objective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Image Fusion Based on Multi-Objective Optimization","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01713934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062652S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36092","articleId":"1713934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1713945,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Optoelectronic Engineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Wang","id":"37086990270"},{"name":"Jianwei Li","affiliation":["Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Optoelectronic Engineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Jianwei Li","id":"37087348181"},{"name":"Weimin Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Optoelectronic Engineering College, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Weimin Chen","id":"37087214304"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1713945","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Image matching","Databases","Classification algorithms","Hidden Markov models","Laboratories","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","fingerprint identification","fuzzy neural nets","image classification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint image classification","fuzzy wavelet neural network","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fingerprint Classification","Directional Field","Singular Point","Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1713945","abstract":"A fingerprint classification algorithm is proposed in this paper.

The DMWT has been used as decomposition tool to obtain multiresolution data. The efficiencies of these transforms are discussed by evaluating watermarked image quality and robustness of the watermark. Due to the multiresolution representation obtained from using DWT and DMWT, the algorithms using both transforms yield better image quality than the one using DCT. Due to the fact that DMWT provides the possibility of superior performance for image processing applications, the algorithm using DMWT yields best image quality and gives the most robust watermark under common image processing. Simulated results show that the DMWT method is superior to other two methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Performance analysis","Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Image quality","Discrete transforms","Robustness","Image processing","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","image sampling","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Image watermarking","Multiwavelet","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image watermarking","Multiwavelet","Robustness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713950","publicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/11210/36092/01713950.pdf","startPage":"9984","endPage":"9987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2006.1713950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Performances Analysis of Transformation Methods in Image Watermarking Using Subsamplimg","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1713950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Performances Analysis of Transformation Methods in Image Watermarking Using Subsamplimg","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1713950/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1713950/","accessionNumber":"9062963","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Performances Analysis of Transformation Methods in Image Watermarking Using Subsamplimg","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01713950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04605S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36092","articleId":"1713950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1713957,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyun Qing","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiangyun Qing","id":"37858529700"},{"name":"Xingyu Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xingyu Wang","id":"37859882700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1713957","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Face detection","Geometry","Pattern recognition","Educational institutions","Information science","Educational technology","Educational programs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Laplacian+OPRA faces","local preserving projections","orthogonal projection reduction by affinity","eigenfaces","fisherfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","eigenfaces","fisherfaces","Laplacianfaces","OPRA-faces"]}],"abstract":"We propose a face recognition method named the Laplacian+OPRA-faces approach based on the Laplacian-faces and the OPRA-faces approach.

Researches have shown that WNN does well in the approximation of nonlinear function and consequently it can be employed in image denoising. In our denoising approach, feature extracting is performed with the help of an improved median filtering, and feature values normalized by exponential function are input into the WNN trained by the classic but efficient gradient descent method (GDM).

The aim of this investigation is to improve the fault diagnosis capability of intelligent BIT for More-Electric Aircraft Electrical Power System (MEAEPS). In constructing the BIT system, the wavelet packet transform is applied to extract fault features. Through the wavelet packet decomposition, we get the fault eigenvectors and input them into a hybrid neural network, which performs in the role of a fault classifier. This hybrid network adds a supervised learning vector quantization (LVQ) layer to the generalized learning vector quantization (GLVQ) network, which makes the boundaries among the fault classes more discriminative than using the GLVQ network alone. Since the original GLVQ algorithm suffers from several major problems, we modify the original algorithm in order to make this network more suitable for application.

Simulation shows the efficiency of the proposed DSPSOA for this special JSSP.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2006.1714506","startPage":"7312","endPage":"7316","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/11210/36092/01714506.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 6th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2006.1714506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual Similar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Job-Shop Scheduling with Penalty","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Scheduling algorithm","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Costs","Job production systems","Particle production","Manufacturing automation","Computational modeling","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["goods distribution","job shop scheduling","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Job-shop Scheduling","Dual Similar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","Maximize Profit","Due-date"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Job-shop Scheduling","Dual Similar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","Maximize Profit","Due-date"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1714506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Dual Similar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Job-Shop Scheduling with Penalty","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1714506/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9076454","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual Similar Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Job-Shop Scheduling with Penalty","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"01714506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073999S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11210","isNumber":"36092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11210","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36092","articleId":"1714506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1714511,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-sheng Chai","affiliation":["Machinery College, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"Yong-sheng Chai","id":"37087552593"},{"name":"Yu-lan Zhou","affiliation":["Machinery College, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"Yu-lan Zhou","id":"37087554353"},{"name":"Yibao Chen","affiliation":["Machinery College, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"Yibao Chen","id":"37087184402"},{"name":"Bin Zhu","affiliation":["Machinery College, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"lastName":"Bin Zhu","id":"37087277481"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0332-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1714511","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1714511","abstract":"An immune genetic algorithm (IGA) was proposed for dynamic job-shop scheduling.

These calculations have been obtained using our recently developed three-dimensional whole-Earth electromagnetic wave propagation model based upon the rigorous finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations.

A new strategy is described to estimate the MI using a priori knowledge of the scene, reducing reliance on a \"ground truth\" reference map, by retaining bands with high associated MI values (subject to the so-called \"complementary\" conditions). Simulations of classification performance on 16 classes of vegetation from the AVIRIS 92AV3C data set show the effectiveness of the method, which outperforms an MI-based method using the associated reference map, an entropy-based method, and a correlation-based method.

Polarimetric target decomposition is used to differentiate the multiple-bounce scatterings contained in the PolSAR images.

Improved performances have been demonstrated in many applications, but using such classifiers can require large storage and complex processing units due to exponential calculations and a large number of coefficients involved. This poses a serious problem for portable real-time pattern recognition applications. In this paper, first the performance of GMM and its hardware complexity are analyzed and compared with a number of benchmark algorithms. Next, an efficient digital hardware implementation is proposed. A number of design strategies are proposed in order to achieve the best possible tradeoffs between circuit complexity and real-time processing. First, a serial-parallel vector-matrix multiplier combined with an efficient pipelining technique is used. A novel exponential calculation circuit based on a linear piecewise approximation is proposed to reduce hardware complexity. The precision requirement of the GMM parameters in our classifier are also studied for various classification problems. The proposed hardware implementation features programmability and flexibility offering the possibility to use the proposed architecture for different applications with different topologies and precision requirements. To validate the proposed approach, a prototype was implemented in 0.25-mum CMOS technology and its operation was successfully tested for gas identification application","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/36101/01715329.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2006.884048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2006.884048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1715329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Digital VLSI Implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models-Based Classifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Hardware","Pattern recognition","CMOS technology","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Pipeline processing","Circuits","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","Gaussian processes","pattern classification","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient digital VLSI implementation","Gaussian mixture models-based classifier","GMM-based classifiers","pattern recognition","hardware complexity","digital hardware implementation","design strategies","circuit complexity","real-time processing","serial-parallel vector-matrix multiplier","pipelining technique","exponential calculation circuit","linear piecewise approximation","programmability","CMOS","gas identification application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital VLSI architecture","GMM","pattern recognition","reconfigurable architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Digital VLSI Implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models-Based Classifier","volume":"14","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1715329/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9162579","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Digital VLSI Implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models-Based Classifier","sourcePdf":"14tvlsi09-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072014S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"36101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"36101","articleId":"1715329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1715334,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Tahoori","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/36101/1715334/1715334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehdi B.

For such systems, typically considered under the imprecise computation model, a function assigns reward to the application depending on the amount of computation allotted to it. Also, these systems often have stringent energy constraints since many such applications run on battery powered devices. We address in this paper, the problem of maximizing rewards for imprecise computation systems that have energy constraints, more specifically, the problem of determining the voltage at which each task runs as well as the number of optional cycles such that the total reward is maximal while time and energy constraints are satisfied. We propose a quasi-static approach that is able to exploit, with low online overhead, the dynamic slack that arises from variations in the actual number of task execution cycles. In our quasi-static approach, the problem is solved in two steps: first, at design-time, a set of voltage/optional-cycles assignments are computed and stored (offline phase); second, the selection among the precomputed assignments is left for runtime, based on actual completion times and consumed energy (online phase). The advantages of the approach are demonstrated through numerous experiments with both synthetic examples and a real life application","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Static Assignment of Voltages and Optional Cycles in Imprecise-Computation Systems With Energy Considerations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2006.884152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/36102/01715348.pdf","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2006.884152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1715348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Static Assignment of Voltages and Optional Cycles in Imprecise-Computation Systems With Energy Considerations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1715348/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9153001","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Static Assignment of Voltages and Optional Cycles in Imprecise-Computation Systems With Energy Considerations","sourcePdf":"01715348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078495S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"36102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"36102","articleId":"1715348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1715351,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A completely specified n-input, n-output Boolean function is called reversible if it maps each input assignment to a unique output assignment and vice versa. Logic synthesis for reversible functions differs substantially from traditional logic synthesis and is currently an active area of research. The authors present an algorithm and tool for the synthesis of reversible functions. The algorithm uses the positive-polarity Reed-Muller expansion of a reversible function to synthesize the function as a network of Toffoli gates. At each stage, candidate factors, which represent subexpressions common between the Reed-Muller expansions of multiple outputs, are explored in the order of their attractiveness. The algorithm utilizes a priority-based search tree, and heuristics are used to rapidly prune the search space. The synthesis algorithm currently targets the generalized n-bit Toffoli gate library. However, other algorithms exist that can convert an n-bit Toffoli gate into a cascade of smaller Toffoli gates. Experimental results indicate that the authors' algorithm quickly synthesizes circuits when tested on the set of all reversible functions of three variables.

The first heuristic predicts the effects of various mapping decisions on the area of the final solution, and the second heuristic bounds the depth of the mapping solution at each node. In depth-oriented mode, when targeting five lookup tables (LUTs), IMap obtains depth optimal solutions that are 44.4%, 19.4%, and 5% smaller than those produced by FlowMap, CutMap, and DAOMap, respectively. Targeting the same LUT size in area-oriented mode, IMap obtains solutions that are 17.5% and 9.4% smaller than those produced by duplication-free mapping and ZMap, respectively. IMap is also shown to be highly efficient. Runtime improvements of between 2.3times and 82times are obtained over existing algorithms when targeting five LUTs.

The authors develop a combinatorial framework through which we prove that many of the time-management problems can be transformed into a min-cost flow problem instance. The methodology is applied to intellectual-property-based datapath synthesis targeting field-programmable gate arrays. The synthesis flow maps the input operations to parameterized library modules during which different time budgeting policies have been applied.

Several power-constrained test-scheduling solutions have been recently proposed to tackle this problem during system integration. However, we show that these approaches cannot guarantee hot-spot-free test schedules because they do not take into account the nonuniform distribution of heat dissipation across the die and the physical adjacency of simultaneously active cores. This paper proposes a new test-scheduling approach that is able to produce short test schedules and guarantee thermal safety at the same time. Two thermal-safe test-scheduling algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm computes an exact (shortest) test schedule that is guaranteed to satisfy a given maximum temperature constraint. The second algorithm is a heuristic intended for complex systems with a large number of embedded cores, for which the exact thermal-safe test-scheduling algorithm may not be feasible. Based on a low-complexity test-session thermal-cost model, this algorithm produces near-optimal length test schedules with significantly less computational effort compared to the optimal algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1715433/","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9146438","volume":"25","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-Safe Test Scheduling for Core-Based System-on-Chip Integrated Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal-Safe Test Scheduling for Core-Based System-on-Chip Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"01715433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0851S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"36103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"36103","articleId":"1715433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1715435,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The RTL ATPG algorithm first generates a test environment for each validation objective, which includes variable assignments, conditional statements, and arithmetic expressions in the hardware description language (HDL) description. The test environment for a given validation objective is a set of symbolic conditions that allow for full controllability and observability of that objective. After the RTL ATPG terminates, a back-end translator intelligently translates the test environments into validation vectors by filling in the necessary values. Since the observability of error effect is naturally handled by the RTL ATPG algorithm, this approach is superior to most existing validation methods, which only focus on the excitation of HDL constructs. A set of heuristics is proposed to utilize high-level circuit information to enhance the RTL ATPG algorithm and to maximize the validation efficiency. The RTL ATPG algorithm is also coupled with an improved RTL validation-coverage metric, which can help users to gain a higher degree of confidence on the quality of generated validation vectors. The usage of the coverage metric also results in the generation of compact vector sets.

This approach combines a low-power test pattern generator (TPG) with scan-chain reordering to achieve low-power testing without losing fault coverage. Three main issues are addressed. First, a smoother is included in the TPG to reduce the average power consumption. However, the fault coverage may be adversely affected by the smoother; hence, a cluster-based scan-chain reordering is employed to remedy this problem. If a very-large power reduction is necessary, the fault-coverage drop can become significant. This can be addressed by reseeding. The second topic of this paper is to give a detailed analysis on the optimal cluster size to minimize the scan-chain length. Finally, a fast and efficient algorithm is developed for scan-chain reorder in order to improve the fault coverage. The reordering algorithm is very efficient in terms of computation time, and the routing length of the reordered scan chain is comparable to or smaller than the result given by commercial tools. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a significant and consistent reduction in the average test power, and the fault coverage is similar to previous methods with the same test lengths","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.870861","startPage":"2586","endPage":"2594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.870861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/36103/01715442.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power BIST With a Smoother and Scan-Chain Reorder Under Optimal Cluster Size","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715442/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Power BIST With a Smoother and Scan-Chain Reorder Under Optimal Cluster Size","volume":"25","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1715442/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9146447","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power BIST With a Smoother and Scan-Chain Reorder Under Optimal Cluster Size","sourcePdf":"01715442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0854S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"36103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"36103","articleId":"1715442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1715456,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The task of ranking multiple-attribute items is relevant in different tasks of e-commerce including request for quotes (RFQ), negotiations, personalized catalogs, profiling, and customer modeling. Often, a linear parametric function is used to model the overall value function considering known individual attribute value functions, and the parameters of the linear function are estimated by linear programming (LP). In this paper, we propose an NN-based active learning method for evaluating and ranking the multiple-attribute items (or bids in RFQ) without imposing the restriction of linear dependence between the attribute value functions. Use of an NN also relaxes the constraint of known parametric form of individual attribute value functions, which is usually assumed in LP-based methods. A suitable objective error measure is defined in this context, and correspondingly, a feedforward NN is trained to obtain the ranking of the item set (or bids).

The combination of these problems is termed a machine loading problem, which is treated as a strongly NP-hard problem. In this paper, the machine loading problem has been modeled by taking into account objective functions and several constraints related to the flexibility of machines, availability of machining time, tool slots, etc. Minimization of system unbalance (SU), maximization of system throughput (TH), and the combination of SU and TH are the three objectives of this paper, whereas two main constraints to be satisfied are related to time and tool slots available on machines. Solutions for such problems even for a moderate number of part types and machines are marked by excessive computational complexities and thus entail the application of some random search optimization techniques to resolve the same. In this paper, a new algorithm termed as constraints-based fast simulated annealing (SA) is proposed to address a well-known machine loading problem available in the literature. The proposed algorithm enjoys the merits of simple SA and simple genetic algorithm and is designed to be free from some of their drawbacks. The enticing feature of the algorithm is that it provides more opportunity to escape from the local minimum. The application of the algorithm is tested on standard data sets, and superiority of the same is witnessed. Intensive experimentations were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the efficacy of the same is authenticated by efficiently testing the performance of algorithm over well-known functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flexible manufacturing systems","Simulated annealing","Testing","Production planning","NP-hard problem","Machining","Throughput","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","flexible manufacturing systems","genetic algorithms","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraints-based fast simulated annealing algorithm","flexible manufacturing system","machine loading problem","NP-hard problem","system throughput maximization","random search optimization techniques","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cauchy distribution function","genetic algorithm (GA)","machine loading","simulated annealing (SA)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2006.878979","startPage":"1170","endPage":"1184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/36105/01715486.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2006.878979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Part-Type Selection and Operation Allocation Problems in an FMS: An Approach Using Constraints-Based Fast Simulated Annealing Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving Part-Type Selection and Operation Allocation Problems in an FMS: An Approach Using Constraints-Based Fast Simulated Annealing Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9158170","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","volume":"36","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1715486/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Part-Type Selection and Operation Allocation Problems in an FMS: An Approach Using Constraints-Based Fast Simulated Annealing Algorithm","sourcePdf":"01715486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142169S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"36105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"36105","articleId":"1715486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1715491,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

An OC place with ordinary arcs, which optimally prevent a siphon from becoming unmarked, is employed whenever it is possible, and otherwise, the WC places that adopt a conservative policy of controlling the release of parts into the system are used. Furthermore, this algorithm is not only for the subclass Petri nets but also for\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$hboxS^3hboxPR$</tex>\n,\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$hboxES^3hboxPR$</tex>\n,\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$hboxS^2hboxLSPR$</tex>\n, and\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$hboxS^3hboxPGR^2$</tex>\nnets.

We study this system in the weakly nonlinear regime as a multiple-access channel, and show that by optimally using the information from all the channels for detection, the change in the capacity region due to the nonlinear effect is minimal. On the other hand, if the receiver uses the output of only one wavelength channel, the capacity is significantly reduced due to the nonlinearity, and saturates as the interference power becomes comparable to the noise, which is consistent with earlier results. The results hold in channels with or without memory. Every point in the capacity region can be achieved without knowledge of the nonlinearity parameters at the transmitters.

The well-known zero-forcing transmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput degradation due to finite-rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the feedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (in decibels) in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain.

The nodes transmit a summary of their observations over a noisy communication channel to a fusion center for the purpose of detection. The observations at the sensors are samples of a spatial stochastic process, which is one of two possible signals corrupted by Gaussian noise. Two cases are considered: one where the signal is deterministic under each hypothesis, and the other where the signal is a correlated Gaussian process under each hypothesis. The nodes are assumed to be subject to a power density constraint, i.e., the power per unit distance is fixed, so that the power per node decreases linearly with the node density. Under these constraints, the central question that is addressed is: how dense should the sensor array be, i.e., is it better to use a few high-cost, high-power nodes or to have many low-cost, low-power nodes? An answer to this question is obtained by resorting to an asymptotic analysis where the number of nodes is large. In this asymptotic regime, the Gaumlrtner-Ellis theorem and similar large-deviation theory results are used to study the impact of node density on system performance. For the deterministic signal case, it is shown that performance improves monotonically with sensor density. For the stochastic signal case, a finite sensor density is shown to be optimal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9149061","htmlLink":"/document/1715546/","displayDocTitle":"How Dense Should a Sensor Network Be for Detection With Correlated Observations?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Dense Should a Sensor Network Be for Detection With Correlated Observations?","sourcePdf":"01715546.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074765S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"36107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"36107","articleId":"1715546","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1715547,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

While this tradeoff captures the essential network dynamics, packets need to scale down with the network size. In this \"fluid model, \" no buffers are required. Due to this packet scaling, D(n) does not correspond to the average delay per bit. This leads to the question whether the tradeoff remains the same when the packet size is kept constant, which necessitates packet scheduling in the network. In this correspondence, this question is answered in the affirmative by showing that the optimal throughput-delay tradeoff is still D(n)=Theta(nT(n)), where now D(n) is the average delay per bit. Packets of constant size necessitate the use of buffers in the network, which in turn requires scheduling packet transmissions in a discrete-time queuing network and analyzing the corresponding delay. Our method consists of deriving packet schedules in the discrete-time network by devising a corresponding continuous-time network and then analyzing the delay induced in the actual discrete network using results from queuing theory for continuous-time networks.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.883548","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/36107/01715548.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.883548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"5111","endPage":"5116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Throughput\u2013Delay Scaling in Wireless Networks\u2014Part II: Constant-Size Packets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1715548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Throughput\u2013Delay Scaling in Wireless Networks\u2014Part II: Constant-Size Packets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715548/","volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1715548/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9149063","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Throughput\u2013Delay Scaling in Wireless Networks\u2014Part II: Constant-Size Packets","sourcePdf":"01715548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080417S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"36107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"36107","articleId":"1715548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1715549,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In addition, it is more efficient to employ composite field arithmetic only in the SubBytes transformation of the AES algorithm. Composite fields can be constructed by using different irreducible polynomials. Nevertheless, how the different constructions affect the complexity of the composite implementation of the SubBytes has not been analyzed in prior works.

Analytical results are provided for the effects of the irreducible polynomial coefficients on the complexity of each involved subfield operation.

To accurately predict the characteristics of nanoscale CMOS, emerging physical effects, such as process variations and correlations among model parameters, must be included. In this paper, a new generation of predictive technology model (PTM) is developed to accomplish this goal. Based on physical models and early-stage silicon data, the PTM of bulk CMOS is successfully generated for 130- to 32-nm technology nodes, with an L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eff</sub>\n of as low as 13 nm.

The minimum achievable sidelobe level have been found for 4-, 6-, 8-, and 10-element antenna arrays fed by lossless networks and compared with the one for antennas fed by lossy networks in which there is no constraints on radiating elements' amplitude distribution. Measured radiation patterns of three different four-beam antennas have been shown to validate the presented analyses.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2006.885015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2006.885015","startPage":"430","endPage":"434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/33542/01715662.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Sidelobe Four-Beam $N$-Element Antenna Arrays Fed by $4times N$ Butler Matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Sidelobe Four-Beam $N$-Element Antenna Arrays Fed by $4times N$ Butler Matrices","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2006","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1715662/","accessionNumber":"9140128","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1715662/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Sidelobe Four-Beam $N$-Element Antenna Arrays Fed by $4times N$ Butler Matrices","sourcePdf":"05lawp01-gruszczynski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049742S","chronDate":"2006","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"33542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"33542","articleId":"1715662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":1715679,"authors":[{"name":"F.-J.

The threshold width of the activation function is automatically determined from the image characteristics. The approach promotes log-domain computation to eliminate all multiplications and divisions, utilizing approximation techniques for efficient estimation of the log2 and inverse-log2. The design incorporates the dynamic thresholds of the activation functions and update rate. The improved quadrant symmetric architecture is also presented to provide very high throughput rate for homomorphic filters which is part of the pixel intensity enhancement across RGB components in the system. The pipelined design of the filter features the flexibility in reloading a wide range of kernels for different frequency responses. A new approach for the design of the uniform filters is also presented to reduce the processing element arrays (PEAs) from W PEAs to 2 PEAs for W times W window. This new concept is applied to assist in training the synaptic weights of the neural network for color balancing to restore the intensity enhanced image to its natural color existed in the original image. The concept of uniform filter is further extended to design max/min filters. It is observed that the performance of the system with parallel and pipelined architectures is able to achieve 139.3 million outputs per second (MOPS), or equivalently 54.7 billion operations per second on Xilinx's Virtex II XC2V2000-4ff896 FPGA at a clock frequency of 139.3 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246656","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716067.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hardware Architecture for Color Image Enhancement Using a Machine Learning Approach with Adaptive Parameterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716067/","displayDocTitle":"A Hardware Architecture for Color Image Enhancement Using a Machine Learning Approach with Adaptive Parameterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9722820","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716067/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hardware Architecture for Color Image Enhancement Using a Machine Learning Approach with Adaptive Parameterization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062215S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1716069,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Ma","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaolong Ma","id":"37087834738"},{"name":"K.K.

At the same time this network has a number of specific properties and advantages. Its backpropagation learning algorithm does not require differentiability of the activation function. The functionality of MLMVN is higher than the ones of the traditional feedforward neural networks and a variety of kernel-based networks. Its higher flexibility and faster adaptation to the mapping implemented make possible an accomplishment of complex problems using a simpler network. The MLMVN can be used to solve those non-standard recognition and classification problems that cannot be solved using other techniques.

A prior knowledge about the distorting operator and its parameter is of crucial importance in blurred image restoration.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246719","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716130.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"480","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer Neural Network based on Multi-Valued Neurons and the Blur Identification Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer Neural Network based on Multi-Valued Neurons and the Blur Identification Problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9722881","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716130/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer Neural Network based on Multi-Valued Neurons and the Blur Identification Problem","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.199777S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716132,"authors":[{"name":"H.E.

Additional circuitry is proposed to translate between standard and the proposed pseudo-logarithmic number representation. The operations for the representation translation, addition and multiplication with pseudo-logarithmic numbers have been implemented in software and several experiments have been carried out to assess their performance when used in a SVM-based computational architecture that was used for data classification.

The nodes are composed of logistic recursive maps, which interact through parametric coupling, i.e., through dynamic modulation of the bifurcation parameters. These networks are used to implement associative memories in which the coding of binary strings is done through spatio-temporal attractors with period-2 cycles. The associative performance of such arrangements is measured under several levels of analog noise in the prompting pattern (initial conditions of the coupled recursions). The phenomena of unbalanced power of attractors is detected. The paper also identifies and analyzes the issue of fragmented (non-convex) regions associated to the attractors representing binary zeros and binary ones of the stored strings. This subject is approached in the context of associative networks operating under analog noise and the related degradation of performance. A simple pre-processing technique aiming to overcome the mentioned fragmentation of basins of attraction resulted in marked improvement of network performance, particularly in highly noisy situations.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246744","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716155.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"652","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fragmented Basins of Attraction of Recursive Processing Elements in Associative Neural Networks and its Impact on Pattern Recovery Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Fragmented Basins of Attraction of Recursive Processing Elements in Associative Neural Networks and its Impact on Pattern Recovery Performance","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9722906","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716155/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fragmented Basins of Attraction of Recursive Processing Elements in Associative Neural Networks and its Impact on Pattern Recovery Performance","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048042S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716155","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716156,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Zhang","affiliation":["Software School, Hunan University, Changsha, China","Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Jin Zhang","id":"37087149804"},{"name":"Guang Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Guang Li","id":"37087148906"},{"name":"W.J.

To device a method for signal interpretation and automate the process of defect severity classification under varying operating conditions, a multilayer feed-forward neural network has been developed. A health index based on the Weibull theory has been proposed for defect severity assessment. Feature vectors extracted from the wavelet transform and spectral post-processing of the vibration data were used as inputs to the neural network. The designed neural network has shown to be able to effectively differentiate faulty bearings from a comparatively \"healthy\" bearing, identify defective elements, and classify the defect severity using a corresponding health index value. A classification rate of 99% and 97% were achieved for defects in the inner and outer raceways, respectively. The results encourage further exploration of various neural network structures for automated bearing health diagnosis under varying operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246781","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716192.pdf","startPage":"899","endPage":"906","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Approach to Bearing Health Assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Approach to Bearing Health Assessment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9722940","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716192/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Approach to Bearing Health Assessment","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066724S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716193,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Aiming at reducing the number of neurons in the hidden layer, for regularization purposes, the center and dispersion of each RBF have to be properly defined by means of competitive learning. Only the output weights will be defined in a supervised manner. One of the drawbacks of such learning methodology, involving unsupervised and supervised learning, is that the centers will be defined so that regions in the input space with a high density of samples tend to be under-represented and those regions with a low density of samples tend to be over-represented. Additionally, few approaches provide a proper and individual indication of the dispersion of each RBF. This paper presents an immune density-preserving algorithm with adaptive radius, called ARIA, to determine the number of centers, their location and the dispersion of each RBF, based only on the available training data set. Considering classification problems, the algorithm to determine the hidden layer is compared to another immune-inspired algorithm called aiNet, K-means and the random choice of centers. The classification accuracy of the final network is compared to another density based approach and a decision tree classifier, C 5.0. The results are reported and analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246785","startPage":"929","endPage":"935","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716196.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Immunological Density-Preserving Approach to the Synthesis of RBF Neural Networks for classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network synthesis","Neural networks","Neurons","Radial basis function networks","Prototypes","Classification tree analysis","Industrial training","Computer networks","Supervised learning","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","radial basis function networks","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immunological density-preserving approach","RBF neural networks","universal approximators","regularization purposes","competitive learning","unsupervised learning","supervised learning","ARIA","immune-inspired algorithm","aiNet","K-means","radial basis function neural networks","classification accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"An Immunological Density-Preserving Approach to the Synthesis of RBF Neural Networks for classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716196/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9722944","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Immunological Density-Preserving Approach to the Synthesis of RBF Neural Networks for classification","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052788S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1716207,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Local image icon, a 1-dimentional time series, is a kind of image feature extracted from the time information that unit-linking PCNN code the 2-dimentional image into.

In this method, several computer-driven routines are developed to rank the candidate neural network inputs as a function of data partition, network complexity and initialization. Then a network pool is automatically formed having the selected candidate networks characterized with multi-set inputs and different hidden nodes. The ensemble optimization is performed using a multi-objective genetic algorithm by aggregating the ensemble validation error, complexity, and negative correlation into a single quantity of merit. The simulations applied to actual field examples demonstrate that using multi-set-input NNE is more robust than using single-set-input NNE with significantly reduced uncertainty and improved prediction accuracy on the new data for some applications.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246842","startPage":"1294","endPage":"1301","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716253.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Input Neural Network Ensembles in Generating Synthetic Well Logs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716253/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Variable Input Neural Network Ensembles in Generating Synthetic Well Logs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716253/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9722991","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Input Neural Network Ensembles in Generating Synthetic Well Logs","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062632S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716260,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jiayan Jiang","id":"37087615818"},{"name":"Liming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Liming Zhang","id":"37087147308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716260","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Principal component analysis","Laplace equations","Linear approximation","Data visualization","Manifolds","Testing","Data analysis","Extraterrestrial measurements","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","data visualisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manifold learning algorithm","neural network","low-dimensional embedding","high-dimensional samples","nonlinear dimensionality reduction ability","data visualization","data classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246849","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716260.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending Manifold Leaning Algorithms by Neural Networks","abstract":"Manifold learning algorithms have been recently reported superior to classical dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA or MDS, in their ability to discover a more meaningful low-dimensional embedding of the high-dimensional samples.

We first examine these algorithms, and then show that the nonlinear dimensionality reduction ability can be acquired by neural networks, thus the extension problem is easily addressed. This model is very flexible and still preserves the nonlinear nature of the manifold leaning algorithms.

There are various methods based on DGA such as IEC, Roger, Dornenburg, and etc. However, these methods have been applied on the different problems with different standards. Also, it is difficult to achieve the diagnosis with accuracy by DGA without experienced experts. In order to resolve theses drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel diagnosis method using fuzzy clustering and a radial basis neural network (RBFNN). In neural network, fuzzy clustering is effective for selecting the efficient training data and reducing learning process time.

However, to our knowledge few attempts have been made to develop a neural network model of the process of decisionmaking, which is a typical intellectual activity. In this paper we propose a neural network model of the decision-making process based on the analytic network process by T. L. Saaty (2001). Although we, S. Matsuda (2005) previously proposed a neural network model for the decision-making process based on the analytic hierarchy process by T. L. Saaty (1972), the analytic network process is more elaborate than the analytic hierarchy process. By viewing decision making as an optimization process based on the analytic network process to satisfy many objectives to the greatest degree possible, we present a neural network model of the decision-making process. Furthermore, the model also works effectively in more practical situations where we cannot give the precise information or all the information necessary to make the decision. Finally, we apply the proposed neural network to an example and illustrate its validity through simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716271/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716271/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Model for the Decision-Making Process Based on ANP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Model for the Decision-Making Process Based on ANP","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062859S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716277,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenfu Bi","affiliation":["Department of Instrument and Control at Shandong, Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Zhenfu Bi","id":"37087383229"},{"name":"Fusheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Instrument and Control at Shandong, Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Fusheng Wang","id":"37087587529"},{"name":"Congcong Liu","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Congcong Liu","id":"37087807437"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716277","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716277","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Power system stability","Fault currents","Control systems","Fast Fourier transforms","Least squares approximation","Parameter estimation","Electrical fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","fault currents","least squares approximations","mathematics computing","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system control","power system stability","vacuum interrupters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive linear neural network","power system stability","power system control","fast Fourier transform","least square parameter estimation algorithms","fault current","vacuum interrupter synchronous breaking short-circuit","orthogonal filter","error estimation","MATLAB-based simulation","adaptive neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246866","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716277.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Getting parameters in power systems based on adaptive linear neural network","abstract":"One of the key issues in the power system stability and control is to detect parameters quickly.

The risk of catastrophic forgetting is particularly high when a network is adapted with new data that do not adequately represent the knowledge included in the original training data. Two original solutions are proposed to reduce the risk that the network focuses on new data only, loosing its generalization capability. The first one, conservative training, is a variant to the target assignment policy, while the second approach, support vector rehearsal, selects from the training set the patterns that lay near the borders of the classes not included in the adaptation set. These patterns are used as sentinels that try to keep unchanged the original boundaries of these classes. Moreover, we investigated the extension of the classical approach consisting in applying linear transformations not only to the input features, but also to the outputs of the internal layers. The motivation is that the outputs of an internal layer represent a projection of the input pattern into a space where it should be easier to learn the classification or transformation expected at the output of the network. We illustrate the problems using an artificial test-bed, and apply our techniques to a set of adaptation tasks in the domain of automatic speech recognition (ASR) based on artificial neural networks. Supervised ASR adaptation experiments with several corpora and for different adaptation types are described. We report on the adaptation potential of different techniques, and on the generalization capability of the adapted networks. The results show that the combination of the proposed approaches mitigates the catastrophic forgetting effects, and always outperforms the use of the classical transformations in the feature space.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246618","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716291.pdf","startPage":"1554","endPage":"1561","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723027","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716291/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptation of Artificial Neural Networks Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.15507S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1716294,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper we present a new model of symbol grounding transfer in cognitive robots. Language learning simulations demonstrate that robots are able to acquire new action concepts via linguistic instructions. This is achieved by autonomously transferring the grounding from directly grounded action names to new higher-order composite actions. The robot's neural network controller permits such a grounding transfer. The implications for such a modeling approach in cognitive science and autonomous robotics are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246621","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1582","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716294.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Language Acquisition and Symbol Grounding Transfer with Neural Networks and Cognitive Robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grounding","Neural networks","Cognitive robotics","Cognition","Robot sensing systems","Postal services","Humans","Robot control","Communication system control","Cognitive science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive systems","neurocontrollers","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["language acquisition","symbol grounding transfer","cognitive robots","ideal cognitive modeling methodology","cognitive agents","language learning simulations","linguistic instructions","robot neural network controller","autonomous robotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Language Acquisition and Symbol Grounding Transfer with Neural Networks and Cognitive Robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716294/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723030","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Language Acquisition and Symbol Grounding Transfer with Neural Networks and Cognitive Robots","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072028S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716313,"authors":[{"name":"K.Y.

This paper proposes to utilize the computational efficiency property of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) to find some efficient splitting solutions in limited timeframe. The solutions are optimized based on a cost function considering the balance between real power generation and consumption, the relative importance of customers, the capacities of distribution and transmission systems, and possibility of region to be impacted, etc. The solutions not only provide the lines to cut but also the corresponding load shedding information in each island. Simulations with large scale power system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246642","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716315.pdf","startPage":"1719","endPage":"1725","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization based Defensive Islanding of Large Scale Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization based Defensive Islanding of Large Scale Power System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723051","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716315/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization based Defensive Islanding of Large Scale Power System","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072263S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716318,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This proposed system can reduce peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) by a neural phase rotator and it does not need any side information to transmit phase rotation factors. Moreover, this system can suppress intercarrier interference (ICI) by two techniques. One is a common phase error (CPE) compensation technique which allows estimating frequency offset at receiver. The other is a ICI suppression technique by using the replica method. We can generate a replica of the transmitted OFDM signal by using estimated frequency offset and suppress ICI at receiver. From numerical experiments, it is shown that our system can reduce PAPR and ICI at the same time and improve BER performance effectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716318.pdf","startPage":"1736","endPage":"1741","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Performance Improvement of Biased PCC-OFDM with Neural Phase Rotator by Suppressing ICI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Neural networks","Frequency division multiplexing","Transmitters","Phase noise","Hopfield neural networks","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","neural nets","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER performance improvement","biased PCC-OFDM","neural phase rotator","ICI suppression","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","polynomial cancellation coded OFDM","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","intercarrier interference","common phase error compensation technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"BER Performance Improvement of Biased PCC-OFDM with Neural Phase Rotator by Suppressing ICI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9723054","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Performance Improvement of Biased PCC-OFDM with Neural Phase Rotator by Suppressing ICI","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048523S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1716321,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Song","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Xin Song","id":"37290678100"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Jinkuan Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Yinghua Han","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yinghua Han","id":"37293173100"},{"name":"D.

Similar types of performance degradation can occur when the signal array response is known precisely but the training sample size is small. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach to robust adaptive beamforming. The proposed algorithm is based on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array response and a three-layer radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). In the proposed algorithm, the computation of the optimum weight vector is viewed as a mapping problem, which can be modeled using a RBFNN trained with input/output pairs. Our proposed approach offers fast convergence rate, provides excellent robustness against some types of mismatches and makes the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one. Computer simulation results are presented, which show that the proposed algorithm yields significantly better performance as compared with the existing adaptive beamforming algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716321/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9723057","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716321/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network-Based Robust Adaptive Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network-Based Robust Adaptive Beamforming","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069051S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716337,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Finally, through experimentation we show that our approach, referred to as a gap-based estimation approach, is superior to the compared approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246908","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716338.pdf","startPage":"1870","endPage":"1877","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gap-Based Estimation: Choosing the Smoothing Parameters for Probabilistic and General Regression Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Gap-Based Estimation: Choosing the Smoothing Parameters for Probabilistic and General Regression Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723074","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716338/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gap-Based Estimation: Choosing the Smoothing Parameters for Probabilistic and General Regression Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060266S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716346,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Chu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Feng Chu","id":"37087253749"},{"name":"Lipo Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lipo Wang","id":"37087219415"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716346","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Cancer","Gene expression","Testing","Radial basis function networks","Neoplasms","Statistical analysis","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","genetics","medical computing","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural networks","cancer classification","microarray gene expressions","radial basis function","lymphoma data set","small round blue cell tumors","ovarian cancer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716346","abstract":"Accurate classification of cancers based on microarray gene expressions is very important for doctors to choose a proper treatment.

The former first 10 values of each record account for geometrical features of cells extracted with FNA biopsy. The last parameter represents the nature of the tumour; two classes of tumour are considered in this database: benignant and malignant tumours. An Intelligent System, IDEST, was designed and implemented. At the core of this system there's an Artificial Neural Network that is able to classify cases. The design of such an ANN is a non trivial task and choices incoherent with the problem could lead to instability of the network. For these reasons a fixed topology genetic algorithm (GA) approach was used to find an optimal topology for the given problem. In a second step a multi-objective GA (MOGA) was developed and employed in order to refine the search in the \"topology space\". Results shown by the IDEST demonstrate the great potentialities of similar approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716350/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723086","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716350/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Approach to Artificial Neural Network Topology Optimisation: The Breast Cancer Classification Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Approach to Artificial Neural Network Topology Optimisation: The Breast Cancer Classification Problem","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086673S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716352,"authors":[{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Power Systems, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Li Liu","id":"37423391700"},{"name":"D.A.

This issue can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem. The proposed approach employs the PSO algorithm for optimal setting of optimal power flow (OPF) based on loss minimization (LM) function. The study is carried out in two steps. First, by using the tangent vector technique, the critical area of the power system is identified under the point of view of voltage instability. Second, once this area is identified, the PSO technique calculates the amount of shunt reactive power compensation that takes place in each bus. The proposed approach has been examined and tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system. The results are promising and show the effectives of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246945","startPage":"1988","endPage":"1992","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716355.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss Power Minimization Using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Load flow","Power system modeling","Voltage","Birds","Minimization methods","Power systems","Reactive power","System testing","Nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss power minimization","particle swarm optimization","nonlinear optimization problem","optimal power flow"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Loss Power Minimization Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716355/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723091","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss Power Minimization Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05084S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1716357,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

The electrical cell impedance sensing (ECIS) system [ECIS 8W1E element array of gold electrodes] is used as a substrate for the culture of rat pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells. The neurotoxicity biosensor is a microfabricated solid state device that mimics the natural environment of PC 12 cells that are responsive to neurotoxins. The PC 12 neurotoxicity biosensors are complemented by artificial neural networks (ANNs) to recognize the impedance profiles of the cells under the influence of a neurotoxin. The neurotoxins were rotenone (Rot), okadaic acid (OA) and peroxynitrite (Per), which are all known to induce cell death in PC 12 cells. Three multilayer feedforward artificial neural network models were developed using a back-propagation algorithm for pattern recognition of neurotoxins. The neurotoxin network (NTN) and the neurotoxin concentration network (NTCN), were trained with data from all the neurotoxins and the cascade network (NTN_NTCN) was developed by combining both the NTN and NTCN. The cascade network was developed to screen against false positives. The neurotoxicity biosensor coupled with these networks allowed for the action of unknown agents (neurotoxins) to be deduced by the measured cellular response. Using back-propagation ANNs to distinguish neurotoxins under the cascade network, the highest success recognition rate for concentration identification were 96% for peroxynitrite, 88% for rotenone, and 96% for okadaic acid. The recognition rate for neurotoxin identification was 98%. The ANN models required less than ten minutes to train and demonstrated that back-propagation ANNs can be handled by commercially-available computers to train and assimilate neurotoxin impedance information, permitting high success rates in the neurotoxin recognition problems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246947","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716357.pdf","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2008","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network for Temporal Impedance Recognition of Neurotoxins","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network for Temporal Impedance Recognition of Neurotoxins","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723093","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716357/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network for Temporal Impedance Recognition of Neurotoxins","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054905S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1716359,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Given that pattern recognition involves fast identification of a set of fundamental features, the essence of the sound recognition problem is the competing needs for both high-dimensionality representations (necessary for accurate discrimination) and a reasonably limited feature space (necessary for rapid identification). We have previously developed an acoustic recognition capability using a novel biologically based dynamic synapse neural network (DSNN) technology. The DSNN based technology has been demonstrated to classify target sounds with a high degree of accuracy, even in high noise conditions. We have also developed an efficient training algorithm for DSNNs. In this paper we focus on extending the acoustic recognition capability of DSNNs to a hardware implementation and applying the new hardware (acoustic SENTRI) to the problem of gunshot recognition. SENTRI is based on Texas instrument TMS320C6713 DSK and a custom designed data acquisition board. An array of four microphones is attached to the board for sound input. A time delay estimation algorithm (TDE) is employed for triangulation. In field-testing, the SENTRI classifies and localizes over 90% of the trained-for sounds. Performance for firecracker, starter pistol, 9 mm, and 44 caliber, explosion/firing sounds was also tested.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246949","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716359.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","startPage":"2015","endPage":"2022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Dynamic Synapse Neural Networks for Acoustic Sound Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of Dynamic Synapse Neural Networks for Acoustic Sound Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716359/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9723095","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of Dynamic Synapse Neural Networks for Acoustic Sound Recognition","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05881S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716361,"authors":[{"name":"H.-H.

Furthermore, the PSO strategy eliminates degradation of generalization error due to overtraining resulting from the training set size, number of training epochs, and data set structure. Overall results obtained with the PSO strategy reveal the importance of optimizing parameters and weights using a consistent objective function.

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is the metric utilized to measure classifier performance, and in order to better understand AUC and ROC behavior, pseudo-ROC curves created from simulated data are introduced. ROC curves depend entirely upon the rankings created by classifiers. The rank distributions discussed in this paper display classifier performance in a novel form, and the behavior of these rank distributions provides insight into classifier fusion for the SCP.

An automated and adaptive defensive tool is imperative for computer networks. One of the emerging solutions for Network Security is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). However, this technology still faces some challenges such as low detection rates, high false alarm rates and requirement of heavy computational power. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning algorithm called Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) which utilizes semi-parametric learning model and Adaptive boosting techniques to reduce learning bias and generalization variance in difficult classification. In this paper, BMPNN is implemented as a classifier to detect different types of network anomalies in the KDD-99 benchmark. Extensive experimental outcome indicates that the proposed BMPNN outperforms other state-of- the-art learning algorithms in terms of detection accuracy and model robustness at an affordable computational cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716408/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723139","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716408/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) for Network Intrusion Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosted Modified Probabilistic Neural Network (BMPNN) for Network Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087095S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716409,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Commonly this task is performed by antivirus software tools that rely on prior explicit knowledge of the worm's code, which is represented by signatures. We present a new approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting the presence of computer worms based on the computer's behavioral measures. In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms. In addition, ANN may be used to identify the most relevant, measurable, features and thus reduce the feature dimensionality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716409/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723140","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716409/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks Techniques to Computer Worm Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Artificial Neural Networks Techniques to Computer Worm Detection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101144S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1716412,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, we propose a new FER technique that utilizes the 2-D DCT of full size facial images and a decision tree with feedforward neural network (NN) based nodes. The first NN-based node of the decision tree is designated to separate one group of facial expressions with members \"smile\" and \"surprise\" from another group that contains \"anger\" and \"sadness\". This node can reduce the confusion between the category members of the two groups. Two NN-based nodes that follow the first node are established for each group to separate their two members. As a result, the original recognition problem with four categories is divided into three subproblems, each having only two members to distinguish. This work is the first trial to use NN, decision tree and 2-D DCT simultaneously within a single recognition task. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed recognition technique, we use two databases, including a recently constructed one, which contain 2-D front face images of 60 men and 60 women, respectively. Experimental results reveal that the new technique outperforms, on the whole, the simple vector matching and K-means based vector matching techniques and two recently developed methods using fixed-size and constructive neural networks. The mean recognition rates of the new technique have been found as high as 97.5% and 93.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716418/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9739623","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716418/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Facial Expression Recognition Technique using 2-D DCT and Neural Networks Based Decision Tree","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Facial Expression Recognition Technique using 2-D DCT and Neural Networks Based Decision Tree","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05168S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716423,"authors":[{"name":"Kou-Yuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kou-Yuan Huang","id":"37087212658"},{"name":"Jiun-De You","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiun-De You","id":"37087809476"},{"name":"Kai-Ju Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kai-Ju Chen","id":"37087808206"},{"name":"Hung-Lin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hung-Lin Lai","id":"37087810056"},{"name":"An-Jin Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"An-Jin Dong","id":"37087808051"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716423","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Erbium","Reflection","Shape","Computer science","Convergence","Space exploration","Pattern recognition","Petroleum","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics","Hough transforms","neural nets","pattern recognition","seismometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hough transform","neural network","seismic pattern detection","direct wave pattern","hyperbola pattern","reflection wave","seismogram","distance calculation","parameter learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716423","abstract":"Hough transform neural network is adopted to detect line pattern of direct wave and hyperbola pattern of reflection wave in a seismogram.

Simulation results shows that the more accurate estimates can be attained by the proposed CRNN algorithm in the presence of non-Gaussian colored noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716433/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723153","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716433/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Cooperative Recurrent Neural Network Algorithm for Parameter Estimation of Autoregressive Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cooperative Recurrent Neural Network Algorithm for Parameter Estimation of Autoregressive Signals","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071448S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716445,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Zhihe","affiliation":["Dalian naval academy, Dalian, China","Navigation College of Northwest Industry University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Shen Zhihe","id":"37087642841"},{"name":"Liu Feng","affiliation":["Dalian naval academy, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Liu Feng","id":"37087165402"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716445","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716445","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Target recognition","Signal processing","Marine technology","Sonar","Signal analysis","Humans","Data mining","Arithmetic","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","military computing","military vehicles","neural nets","object recognition","signal processing","sonar","target tracking","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network","underwater targets recognition","antisubmarine warfare","underwater signal processing technology","sonar operator experience"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247135","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716445.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","startPage":"2588","endPage":"2592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Improved BP Neural Network In Underwater Targets Recognition","abstract":"Underwater targets recognition has always been a difficulty in anti-submarine warfare. The current recognition methods are either applying underwater signal processing technology or depending on the sonar operator's experience. But due to the complexity of the marine circumstances, it usually fails to meet the need of anti-submarine warfare when using single recognition method. Then we need to combine above two methods effectively to recognize the targets synthetically. The paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of two methods, combines underwater signal processing and human experiences to extract the distinguishable characteristics synthetically, then applies the BP neural network for auto-recognition. The paper also advances the improved arithmetic to the BP neural network. Through simulation test with the collected data and comparing with the result of other method of underwater targets recognition, the paper proves the effectiveness of applying improved BP neural network in underwater targets recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716445/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723165","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716445/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applying Improved BP Neural Network In Underwater Targets Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Improved BP Neural Network In Underwater Targets Recognition","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC","sourcePdf":"01716445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051213S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716446,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Hung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Hung Lee","id":"37087207271"},{"name":"Bor-Hang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Hang Wang","id":"37087376763"},{"name":"Hua-Hsiang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hua-Hsiang Chang","id":"37087377016"},{"name":"Yi-Hung Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Hung Pang","id":"37088121889"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716446","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Brain modeling","Filters","Associative memory","Input variables","Electronic mail","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","fuzzy control","Gaussian processes","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","PD control","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMAC neural network","wavelet","nonlinear control","feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMAC neural network","wavelet","nonlinear control","feedback"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716446","abstract":"This paper proposes a wavelet-based cerebellar model arithmetic controller neural network (CMAC NN) and develops a hybrid control scheme, combining supervisory controller, filter, and CMAC, for nonlinear systems.

The proposed method also uses a neural network approach, but differs from the others in how those patterns are perceived. Specifically, the proposed approach begins with the premise that the load demand for a given year can be given a structure which can then be related to the structure of the reference year, in such a way that a transformation can be found from the reference year's structure to the forecasting year's structure. The transformation depends upon how parameters, which influenced the load but can not be measured, move from the reference year to the forecasting year.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716450/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723169","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716450/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Using System-Type Neural Network Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecasting Using System-Type Neural Network Architecture","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067842S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1716452,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The solar collectors are greatly influenced by the operation parameters: ambient temperature (Tamb), input water temperature (Tin), solar irradiance (G) and mainly by manufacture process. Those parameters are important in order to know the quality and the efficiency of a specific solar collector. The efficiency of those systems can be influenced by manufacture process and this condition is not considered in mathematical models of collectors. On other hand, due its facility in solving nonlinear problems, experimental data based, in this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) have been proposed as alternative to represent and to compare solar collectors. In the classification of solar collectors, is important to know how Tamb, Tin, G influence the output water temperature (Tout) (strongly associated to the system efficiency) for each collector considered. These influences may be obtained through the sensitivity analysis of the parameters in relation to Tout. So, through differentiation of a previously trained net, the sensitivity factors can be obtained. The sensitivity factors show how much the input variables influence the output variables. In this paper, the sensitivity analysis via ANN, to compare and classify solar collectors is applied and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716469/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9739631","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716469/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parametric Analysis of Solar Collectors Through Sensitivity Factors Via Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Analysis of Solar Collectors Through Sensitivity Factors Via Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051807S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1716471,"authors":[{"name":"Yicong Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yicong Meng","id":"37287259900"},{"name":"S.Y.M.

The synaptic computation speed is up to maximum pulse frequency. The power consumption is reduced, as active synapses only consume the power. The neuron based on the controlled conductance demonstrates the asynchronous pulse generation with a refractory period, and the behavior of integration-and-firing. The neural network VLSI is fabricated in 0.7 micron CMOS. The experimentation exhibits the behavior of linear controlled conductance, as observed in SPICE simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716476.pdf","startPage":"2793","endPage":"2799","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pulse-based Neural Hardware Implementation Based on the Controlled Conductance by MOSFET Circuit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse circuits","Hardware","MOSFET circuits","Neural networks","Very large scale integration","Neurons","Energy consumption","Tunable circuits and devices","Biological control systems","Biology computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse-based neural hardware","controlled conductance","MOSFET circuit","neural network VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Pulse-based Neural Hardware Implementation Based on the Controlled Conductance by MOSFET Circuit","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9723189","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pulse-based Neural Hardware Implementation Based on the Controlled Conductance by MOSFET Circuit","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074329S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716477,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It maps every input-vector to one vertice of a hypercube and uses a hyperplane to determine its class. The task achieved by a given cellular neural network is considered non-optimal if the hyperplane is poorly positioned in the hypercube, being unnecessarily close to one of its vertices. This property is crucial since cellular neural networks deal with analog signals, meaning that even binary values (namely, the inputs and the initial internal states) will slightly vary about their mean value. This paper presents an algorithm which partially solves this optimization problem. It is based on an original Boolean representation of the threshold-logic function achieved by a cellular neural network. By analyzing its functional symmetries, this algorithm tweaks the original hyperplane to make it fit them. It results in an improved implementation of the threshold-logic function. This algorithm turns out to be the first step of an analytical design method, capable of computing the best hyperplane position, out of a non-optimal one.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247187","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716477.pdf","startPage":"2800","endPage":"2806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Binary-Output CNNs: First Step of an Analytical Design Process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Binary-Output CNNs: First Step of an Analytical Design Process","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716477/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9723190","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Binary-Output CNNs: First Step of an Analytical Design Process","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062575S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1716479,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

Such embedded systems are usually running under hard real time constraints. Hardware and software components included in such systems exhibit variability and therefore affect execution time. The major reason of this variability in the software components is the cache miss operation. Indeed, a cache memory access from an embedded microprocessor might result in a cache hit if the data is available or a cache miss so the data need to be fetched with an additional delay from an external memory. It is therefore highly desirable to predict future memory accesses during execution in order to appropriately evaluate the design performance. The prediction of all component's design performances allow us to implement an efficient management strategy based on dynamic reconfigurable devices. In this paper, we also evaluate the potential of several artificial neural networks for the prediction of instruction memory addresses allocated by an embedded processor. Neural networks have the potential to solve the non-linear behavior observed in memory accesses during program execution. However, embedded processors execute millions of instructions and therefore millions of addresses to be predicted. This very challenging problem of neural network based prediction of large time series is approached in this paper by evaluating various neural network architectures based on the recurrent neural network paradigm with pre-processing stage based on the self organizing map (SOM) classification technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716480/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723193","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716480/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Memory Access Prediction Support for SoC Dynamic Reconfiguration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Memory Access Prediction Support for SoC Dynamic Reconfiguration","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060292S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1716481,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To verify these models and to accelerate simulations prototypes are often implemented in integrated circuits using digital or analog designs. In this work, a simple reconfigurable neural hardware structure (SIRENS) is introduced which is capable to represent several different models of neurons, time-independent and time-dependent models as well.

Two classes of architectures were adopted and the classification capability of these two neural network architectures trained by the proposed two-phase genetic local search algorithm was shown by applying them to the n-bit parity problem.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247223","startPage":"2914","endPage":"2918","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716493.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Phase Genetic Local Search Algorithm for Feedforward Neural Network Training","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Evolutionary computation","Genetic programming","Particle swarm optimization","Computer architecture","Computer science","Backpropagation","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","mathematical operators","neural net architecture","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-phase genetic local search algorithm","feedforward neural network training","evolutionary algorithm","evolutionary programming","orthogonal array crossover operator","neural network architecture","n-bit parity problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Phase Genetic Local Search Algorithm for Feedforward Neural Network Training","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716493/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723202","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Phase Genetic Local Search Algorithm for Feedforward Neural Network Training","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075027S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716494,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Support vector machines belong to the group of semiparametric classifiers. The selection of appropriate parameters, formally known as model selection, is crucial to obtain accurate classification results for a given task. Striving to automate model selection for support vector machines we apply a meta-strategy utilizing genetic algorithms to learn combined kernels in a data-driven manner and to determine all free kernel parameters. The model selection criterion is incorporated into a fitness function guiding the evolutionary process of classifier construction. We consider two types of criteria consisting of empirical estimators or theoretical bounds for the generalization error. We evaluate their effectiveness in an empirical study on four well known benchmark data sets to find that both are applicable fitness measures for constructing accurate classifiers and conducting model selection. However, model selection focuses on finding one best classifier while genetic algorithms are based on the idea of re-combining and mutating a large number of good candidate classifiers to realize further improvements. It is shown that the empirical estimator is the superior fitness criterion in this sense, leading to a greater number of promising models on average.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247266","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716515.pdf","startPage":"3063","endPage":"3069","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Support Vector Machine Model Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithms for Support Vector Machine Model Selection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723219","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716515/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithms for Support Vector Machine Model Selection","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065713S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":1716516,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

The majority of these works has concluded that the combiner error rate is better than diversity to guide the selection process in order to identify the best performing subset of classifiers. However, the classifier selection process has to take into account three different aspects: complexity, overfitting and performance. These aspects of the selection process have not yet been tackled simultaneously in the literature. The study presented in this paper, deals with these three aspects in a handwritten digit recognition problem. Different search criteria such as diversity, error rate and number of classifiers are applied in single and multi-objective optimization approaches using genetic algorithms. In our experiments, we observed that error rate applied in a single optimization approach was the best objective function to increase performance. The generalized diversity and interrater agreement measures, combined with error rate in pairs of objective functions were the best measures to reduce complexity and keep good performance in a multi-objective optimization approach. Finally, the performance of the solutions found in both, single and multi-objective optimization processes were increased by applying a global validation method to reduce overfitting.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247267","startPage":"3070","endPage":"3077","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716516.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms for the Selection of Ensemble of Classifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Error analysis","Diversity reception","Optimization methods","Handwriting recognition","Algorithm design and analysis","Evolutionary computation","Research and development","Search methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective genetic algorithms","ensemble selection","classifier selection process","handwritten digit recognition problem","single optimization approach","global validation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Single and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms for the Selection of Ensemble of Classifiers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716516/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9739638","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms for the Selection of Ensemble of Classifiers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC","sourcePdf":"01716516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050149S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716519,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.P.

While they offer attractive theoretical properties, they have demonstrated only mixed results within real world application domains of particular time series structures and patterns. Commonly, time series are composed of a combination of regular patterns such as levels, trends and seasonal variations. Thus, the capability of novel methods to predict basic time series patterns is of particular relevance in evaluating their initial contribution to forecasting. This paper investigates the accuracy of competing forecasting methods of NN and SVR through an exhaustive empirical comparison of alternatively tuned candidate models on 36 artificial time series. Results obtained show that SVR and NN provide comparative accuracy and robustly outperform statistical methods on selected time series patterns.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247299","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716528.pdf","startPage":"3159","endPage":"3166","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting with Computational Intelligence - An Evaluation of Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting with Computational Intelligence - An Evaluation of Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723230","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716528/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting with Computational Intelligence - An Evaluation of Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090405S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1716529,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Oohori et al. proposed a digital version of the back propagation (called DBP) for a hierarchical digital neural network consisting of the binary units. The DBP can solve a linearly nonseparable problem, and learning performance is comparable to the conventional BP. We propose a digital back propagation through time (called DBPTT) based on the DBP where the BPTT is applied to the digital type recurrent neural network.

In this paper we investigate a simple Hopfield network organised in a two dimensional mesh, with localised interactions. The network remembers a number of periodically repeated, spatially correlated patterns. The weights are obtained via Hebbian learning rule combined with some extra information about the structure of correlations between the patterns, that is our system is in the so called phase coexistence regime in which the free energy for all of the patterns is equal (none of the patterns dominates in the sense it is the unique minimiser of the free energy). The number of remembered patterns is well below the memory limits to simplify the analysis and avoid any network's capacity problems, we can therefore say the network is in finite loading regime. We argue that such a system can be accurately analysed in mesoscopic scale, in which it displays some phenomena characteristic for systems with large scale, isotropic interactions (e.g. Kac potential systems near Lebowitz-Penrose limit) like sharp phase interfaces, motion by mean curvature etc.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247321","startPage":"3260","endPage":"3266","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716543.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mesoscopic Approach to Locally Hopfield Neural Networks in Presence of Correlated Patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Intelligent networks","Computer science","Brain modeling","Mathematical model","Pattern analysis","Temperature distribution","Mathematics","Electronic mail","Hebbian theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hebbian learning","Hopfield neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesoscopic approach","Hopfield neural networks","correlated patterns","computer science","2D mesh","Hebbian learning rule","phase coexistence regime","network capacity problems","finite loading regime","isotropic interactions","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Mesoscopic Approach to Locally Hopfield Neural Networks in Presence of Correlated Patterns","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716543/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723242","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mesoscopic Approach to Locally Hopfield Neural Networks in Presence of Correlated Patterns","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052799S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716552,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Moreover, the particular effectiveness of a Pareto-based optimization approach can also be seen.","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716552.pdf","startPage":"3319","endPage":"3326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised feature selection via multiobjective optimization","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Semi-supervised feature selection via multiobjective optimization","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9723248","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716552/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-supervised feature selection via multiobjective optimization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101547S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716557,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Each stage of the construction process determines a RBF unit, namely its centre vector and diagonal covariance matrix as well as weight, by minimising the LOO statistics. This OFS-LOO algorithm is computationally efficient and it is capable of constructing parsimonious RBF classifiers that generalise well. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is fully automatic and the user does not need to specify a termination criterion for the construction process. The effectiveness of the proposed RBF classifier construction procedure is demonstrated using three classification benchmark examples.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247335","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716557.pdf","startPage":"3358","endPage":"3362","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of RBF Classifiers with Tunable Units using Orthogonal Forward Selection Based on Leave-One-Out Misclassification Rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Construction of RBF Classifiers with Tunable Units using Orthogonal Forward Selection Based on Leave-One-Out Misclassification Rate","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9739644","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716557/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of RBF Classifiers with Tunable Units using Orthogonal Forward Selection Based on Leave-One-Out Misclassification Rate","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056006S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716564,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The classification is carried out using a combination of 3 MLPs with different architectures. The RPROP algorithm is applied for training the networks.

The proposed method makes it possible to generate not only one periodic trajectory but also multiple different trajectories in a neural network simultaneously and to make each periodic trajectory possess specified stability degree. It is known that stability and stability degree of periodic trajectories (limit cycles) can be estimated by checking eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix of the Poincar\u00e9 map defined on them.

Specifically, the goal is to decide whether a bus voltage fault, a current loss fault or a temperature fault has occurred in one of the three reaction wheels and further to localize which wheel is faulty. In order to achieve these objectives, three dynamic neural networks are introduced to model the dynamics of the wheels on all three axes independently. Due to the dynamic property of the wheel, the architecture utilized is the Elman recurrent network with backpropagation learning algorithm. The effectiveness of this neural network-based FDI scheme is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized observer-based scheme.

The method consists in matching a \"de-rectification\" procedure of sunspot data with the use of nonlinear dynamics tools in order to design neural network based predictors with close-to-optimal performance. In fact, whereas the \"de-rectification\" process allows to obtain time series that can be modeled by neural structures much better than the original datasets, the incorporation of the prior knowledge extracted by using nonlinear dynamics into neural networks generates models able to fully capture the chaotic dynamics of solar activity. The proposed approach produces prediction results that outperform the most accurate methods existing in literature both for short and medium-term forecasting horizons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716610/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723287","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716610/","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solar Activity Forecasting by Incorporating Prior Knowledge from Nonlinear Dynamics into Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar Activity Forecasting by Incorporating Prior Knowledge from Nonlinear Dynamics into Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066866S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1716612,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, the problem of seasonal dependency is tackled with a recurrent neural network used as a gate for a statistical mixture model. Historical consumption data along with climatic conditions and other auxiliary descriptors are combined with expert delineation of heating season boundaries to provide training data. The resulting gating system is capable of reliable identification of the start and end of the heating season and, combined with the statistical models, of accurate predictions of gas load.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247390","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716612.pdf","startPage":"3736","endPage":"3741","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network Based Gating for Natural Gas Load Prediction System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network Based Gating for Natural Gas Load Prediction System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723289","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716612/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Neural Network Based Gating for Natural Gas Load Prediction System","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042548S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716614,"authors":[{"name":"L. dos Santos Coelho","affiliation":["Production and Systems Engineering Graduate Program Automation and Systems Laboratory PPGEPS/CCET/PUCPR, Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"L.","lastName":"dos Santos Coelho","id":"37275647200"},{"name":"R.A.

In order to overcome the drawbacks encountered by conventional learning methods, particle swarm optimization - a swarm intelligence methodology - can provide a stochastic global search of B-spline networks for nonlinear system identification.

In most cases, robot fulfills the task by its vision system. However, motion blur due to camera motion caused by wind or other unknown causes can significantly degrade the quality of the image acquired. This is a typical kind of the so called image restoration problem, which is a hard problem since no prior knowledge of the motion is available. For this purpose, a novel approach for image restoration is proposed. The restoration procedure consists of two stages: estimation of blur function parameters and reconstruction of images. Image degradation model is proposed first to identify blur function parameters, then a recurrent neural network is used to restore the blurred image. Experiments on real blurred images on power transmission line prove the feasibility and reliability of this algorithm. Our experiments show that the restoration procedure consumes only small amount of computation time.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246881","startPage":"3854","endPage":"3859","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716629.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Based Image Deblur Using Recurrent Neural Network for Power Transmission Line Inspection Robot","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Power transmission lines","Inspection","Image restoration","Robot vision systems","Degradation","Power system reliability","Machine vision","Cameras","Image reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Motion Based Image Deblur Using Recurrent Neural Network for Power Transmission Line Inspection Robot","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716629/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Based Image Deblur Using Recurrent Neural Network for Power Transmission Line Inspection Robot","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052668S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716630,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Cross-validation has been widely used for estimating the performance of neural networks and early stopping of training. Although cross-validation could give a good estimate of the generalisation errors of the trained neural networks, the question of selecting an neural network to use remains. This paper proposes a new method to train a stable neural network by approximately mapping the output of an average of a set of neural networks obtained from cross-validation. Two experiments have been conducted to show how different the generalisation errors of the trained neural networks from cross-validation could be and how stable an neural network would be by learning the average output of a set of neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246891","startPage":"3925","endPage":"3928","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716639.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Create Stable Neural Networks by Cross-Validation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716639/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Create Stable Neural Networks by Cross-Validation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716639/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723307","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Create Stable Neural Networks by Cross-Validation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC","sourcePdf":"01716639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0535S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716642,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, an effective method for such an objective is still under investigation. This paper presents a method based on wavelet and Independent Analysis Component (ICA) for image classification with adaptive processing of data structures. With wavelet, an image is decomposed into low frequency bands and high frequency bands. An image can be characterized by wavelet coefficients in the form of tree representation. While the histograms of low frequency wavelet bands are effective in characterizing images, the histograms of high frequency wavelet bands are similar for different images and therefore they cannot be directly used as features. We make use of ICA for feature extraction from high frequency bands to improve image classification. Two sets of features are used together to classify images using a structured neural network. In total, 2940 images generated from seven categories are used in experiments. Half of the images are used for training the neural network and the other images used for testing. The classification rate of the training set is 92%, and the classification rate of the test set reaches 89%. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method based on combining wavelet and ICA for image classification.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246915","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716643.pdf","startPage":"3949","endPage":"3954","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Image Classification with Wavelet and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on a Structured Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Image Classification with Wavelet and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on a Structured Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723310","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716643/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Image Classification with Wavelet and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on a Structured Neural Network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716643.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070333S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716644,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-Y.

The scheme performs video delivery in content domain in contrast to the previous approaches in which only temporal frame skipping is adopted. The proposed method requires no buffering of video frames and thus imposing no frame delay. In particular, in case of low bandwidth conditions, the proposed scheme estimates the number of frames that best represent the sequence within a time segment and transmit this number for delivery instead of a temporal frame skipping. Multiple key frames are considered by optimally approximating the real bandwidth availability with a rational fraction. Key frame estimation is accomplished using a neural network model capable of predicting the indices of the most appropriate key frames that are to be delivered without being available the video information. The model takes into account the previous information as it has been evaluated by the already delivered information. The proposed scheme is based on an efficient recursive estimation algorithm since the network weights cannot be considered constant throughout video transmission. This is due to the fact that content as well as bandwidth characteristics vary from time to time.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246927","startPage":"4037","endPage":"4044","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716655.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-based Video Adaptation in Low/Variable Bandwidth Communication Networks Using Adaptable Neural Network Structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716655/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Content-based Video Adaptation in Low/Variable Bandwidth Communication Networks Using Adaptable Neural Network Structures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9723318","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-based Video Adaptation in Low/Variable Bandwidth Communication Networks Using Adaptable Neural Network Structures","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716655.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074406S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1716657,"authors":[{"name":"J.

When confined to enclosed reserves the elephant densities are much higher than observed in the wild. The large nutritional demands and destructive foraging behavior of elephants threaten rare species of vegetation. If conservation management is to protect threatened species of vegetation, knowing how long elephants will stay in one area of the reserve as well as which area they will move to next is essential. The goal of this study is to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to continuously predict an elephant herd's next position in the Pongola Game Reserve. Accurate predictions would provide a useful tool in assessing future impact of elephant populations on different areas of the reserve. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to adapt the weights of the neural network. Results are presented to show the effectiveness of RNN-PSO for elephant migration prediction.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246953","startPage":"4084","endPage":"4088","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716662.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network Based Predictions of Elephant Migration in a South African Game Reserve","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Intelligent networks","Vegetation","Neural networks","Africa","Wildlife","Particle swarm optimization","Power system management","Predictive models","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","ecology","particle swarm optimisation","recurrent neural nets","vegetation","zoology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network based prediction","elephant migration","South African game reserve","conservation management","vegetation","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Neural Network Based Predictions of Elephant Migration in a South African Game Reserve","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723323","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Neural Network Based Predictions of Elephant Migration in a South African Game Reserve","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036935S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716664,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Using the RS-SAN net, a new personal authentication method was proposed which was not influenced by the rotation (in plane) and size changes of the input faces. The recognition characteristics of the RS-SAN net for both learned (familiar) and un-learned (unfamiliar) face images were investigated in various plane rotations and sizes. The RS-SAN net had fairly good orientation and size recognition characteristics only for learned faces, but not for unlearned faces. Thus, the orientation and size of the input face image were rightly corrected only for the learned faces. By adding the inner product and minimum distance as new shape recognition criteria for the RS-SAN net, both the learned and unlearned face images were recognized correctly. After the RS-SAN net corrected both the orientation and size to the registered ones for the arbitrary rotation and size of the input faces, both the false acceptance and false rejection rates were 0% in appropriate threshold ranges; the equal error rates became 0%.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246955","startPage":"4097","endPage":"4103","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716664.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation and Size Independent Face Recognition by the Spreading Associative Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Image recognition","Authentication","Character recognition","Shape","Error analysis","Biometrics","Fingerprint recognition","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["associative processing","face recognition","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["size independent face recognition","rotation independent face recognition","spreading associative neural network","personal authentication method","face image","RS-SAN net"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Rotation and Size Independent Face Recognition by the Spreading Associative Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716664/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9739670","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotation and Size Independent Face Recognition by the Spreading Associative Neural Network","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058084S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1716665,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We showed that the cluster-based approach has the potential to build a more global Chl a prediction model.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246958","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716667.pdf","startPage":"4118","endPage":"4125","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Ocean Water Chlorophyll-a Concentration Using Fuzzy C-means Clustering and Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Ocean Water Chlorophyll-a Concentration Using Fuzzy C-means Clustering and Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723326","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716667/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Ocean Water Chlorophyll-a Concentration Using Fuzzy C-means Clustering and Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098275S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716669,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The first goal of this research is to develop a method for automated road safety analysis using video sensors in order to address the problem of a dependency on the deteriorating collision data. The method will automate the extraction of traffic conflicts (near misses) from video sensor data. To our knowledge, there is limited research primarily applied to traffic conflicts. In this paper a method based on the clustering of vehicle trajectories is presented. The clustering uses a k-means approach with hidden Markov models and a simple heuristic to find the number of clusters automatically. Traffic conflicts can then be detected by identifying and adapting pairs of models of conflicting trajectories. The technique is demonstrated on real world video sequences of traffic conflicts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering Vehicle Trajectories with Hidden Markov Models Application to Automated Traffic Safety Analysis","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246960","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716669.pdf","startPage":"4132","endPage":"4138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Clustering Vehicle Trajectories with Hidden Markov Models Application to Automated Traffic Safety Analysis","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716669/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering Vehicle Trajectories with Hidden Markov Models Application to Automated Traffic Safety Analysis","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077876S","chronDate":"16-21 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1716677,"authors":[{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institution of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zeng-Guang Hou","id":"37087188119"},{"name":"Long Cheng","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institution of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Long Cheng","id":"37087561609"},{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institution of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Min Tan","id":"37087147114"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9490-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1716677","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716677","abstract":"Real-time control of multi-robot coordination system has attracted a lot of attention in recent years.

Such robustness analysis has been performed by calculating a robustness index both for each conditioning factors and for the total model; this allowed us to find the errors in the conditioning factors which affect the neural computation in a greater way and the overall robustness of the model.

The system is applied to human face features searching and experiments show a promising result.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247039","startPage":"4395","endPage":"4400","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716708.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Visual Perceiving and Eyeball-Motion Controlling Neural Network for Object Searching and Locating","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Humans","Automatic control","Biological neural networks","Brain modeling","Eyes","Image recognition","Neurons","Muscles","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","eye","image motion analysis","motion control","neurocontrollers","object detection","position control","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual perceiving neural network","eyeball-motion control","object searching","object location","visual cognitive neural network","human eyes","image signals","object direction recognition","object distance recognition","neuron response transfer","eye gaze","object position","human face feature searching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Visual Perceiving and Eyeball-Motion Controlling Neural Network for Object Searching and Locating","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716708/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723350","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Visual Perceiving and Eyeball-Motion Controlling Neural Network for Object Searching and Locating","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059252S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1716718,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Furthermore, it is verified that the total number of NN's necessary to obtain an adequate tracking response is significantly reduced. Semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the closed loop of the MIMO nonlinear system is achieved and all the outputs converge to small neighborhoods of the desired reference trajectories.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716719.pdf","startPage":"4468","endPage":"4475","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural-Based Backstepping Control of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Backstepping","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Control design","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","MIMO systems","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural-based backstepping control","uncertain MIMO nonlinear system","neural networks","closed loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive nonlinear control","neural-based backstepping","uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural-Based Backstepping Control of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716719/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9723356","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural-Based Backstepping Control of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061991S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1716722,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

One of the prominent features of this neural network is the one-to-one correspondence between its equilibria and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the nonconvex optimization problem. The conditions are derived under which the neural network (locally) converges to the KKT points. It is desired that the neural network is stable at minimum solutions, and unstable at maximum solutions or saddle solutions. It is found in the paper that most likely the neural network is unstable at the maximum solutions. Moreover, we found that if the derived conditions are not satisfied at minimum solutions, by transforming the original problem into an equivalent one with the p-power (or partial p-power) method, these conditions can be satisfied. As a result, the neural network will locally converge to a minimum solution. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the recurrent neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247077","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716726.pdf","startPage":"4522","endPage":"4528","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network for Solving Nonconvex Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Recurrent Neural Network for Solving Nonconvex Optimization Problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723363","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716726/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recurrent Neural Network for Solving Nonconvex Optimization Problems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC","sourcePdf":"01716726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121917S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1716738,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Fang Wang","affiliation":["Environmental Sciences and Applied Systems Branch, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Pei-Fang Wang","id":"37087420513"},{"name":"S.

The controller was implemented using a Jordan-Net based neural network, and the results obtained in our simulations demonstrated that the proposed controller is perfectly able to correctly park the vehicle in different situations.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247124","startPage":"4704","endPage":"4711","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716753.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEVA3D: Using Arti cial Neural Networks to Autonomous Vehicle Parking Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716753/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SEVA3D: Using Arti cial Neural Networks to Autonomous Vehicle Parking Control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716753/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9739697","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEVA3D: Using Arti cial Neural Networks to Autonomous Vehicle Parking Control","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058696S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1716754,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed approach is based on decomposing the neural network into two subsystems. The first subsystem (Subsystem 1) consists of the estimation error and output-layer weight error and the second subsystem (Subsystem 2) consists of the hidden-layer weight error. The key to this decomposition is that the hidden-layer weights appear in Subsystem 1, only as an argument of a sigmoidal function and its derivative which are both known to be bounded. This allows us to regard the Subsystem 1 as a linear-in-parameter neural network (LPNN) whose stability proof is more straightforward. Having shown the stability of the first subsystem, the stability of the second subsystem is also shown subsequently without the requirement of having the limiting assumptions of previous work. The bound on estimation error can be made arbitrarily small by proper selection of design parameters. The estimation scheme is then employed to estimate the state of flexible joint manipulators.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247125","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716754.pdf","startPage":"4712","endPage":"4718","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Stability of Nonlinear Observers Based on Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"On Stability of Nonlinear Observers Based on Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9723382","publicationDate":"2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716754/","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Stability of Nonlinear Observers Based on Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072498S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1716761,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A FLNN constructed in this way has been shown to have better representation ability than an ordinary neural network.

However under high EGR levels the engine exhibits strong cyclic dispersion in heat release which may lead to instability and unsatisfactory performance. A suite of neural network (NN)-based output feedback controllers with and without reinforcement learning is developed to control the SI engine at high levels of EGR even when the engine dynamics are unknown by using fuel as the control input. A separate control loop was designed for controlling EGR levels. The neural network controllers consists of three NN: a) ANN observer to estimate the states of the engine such as total fuel and air; b) a second NN for generating virtual input; and c) a third NN for generating actual control input. For reinforcement learning, an additional NN is used as the critic. The stability analysis of the closed loop system is given and the boundedness of all signals is ensured without separation principle. Online training is used for the adaptive NN and no offline training phase is needed.

An e-modification learning law with projection for weight matrix is employed to guarantee its boundedness and the stability of network without the requirement of persistent excitation. The proposed controller contains an equivalent control and a switching control. The equivalent control uses the learning functions by RNN, switching surface, and a bounded reference input.

This enables us to select the most appropriate function for a given problem.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247233","startPage":"5059","endPage":"5065","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716804.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of Neural Network Based Lyapunov Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716804/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Construction of Neural Network Based Lyapunov Functions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716804/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9739715","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Neural Network Based Lyapunov Functions","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120624S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1716808,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Some of the most common type of neural networks is the multilayer perceptrons and the recurrent neural networks. Most of these networks consist of large number of neurons and hidden layers, which results in a longer training time. A generalized neuron (GN) has a compact structure and overcomes the problem of long training time. Due to its simple structure and lesser memory requirements, the GN is attractive for hardware implementations. This paper presents the online training of a GN with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. A comparative study of the GN and the MLP online trained with PSO is presented for function approximations. The GN based identification of the static VAR compensator (SVC) dynamics in a 12 bus FACTS benchmark power system trained online with the PSO is also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9739717","htmlLink":"/document/1716808/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Online Training of a Generalized Neuron with Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Training of a Generalized Neuron with Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09503S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716809,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

This coupling allows the use of the backward (receptor) model to calibrate the forward (dispersion) model, potentially across a wide range of meteorological conditions. The genetic algorithm optimizes the source calibration factors that connect the two models. This methodology is demonstrated for a basic Gaussian plume dispersion model, then progresses to incorporating an operational transport and dispersion model. It is verified in the context of both synthetic data and actual monitored data from field tests with known release amounts. Its error bounds are set using Monte Carlo techniques and robustness assessed through the addition of white noise. The impact of varying the genetic algorithm parameters is assessed.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247238","startPage":"5096","endPage":"5103","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/11216/36115/01716809.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2006 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2006.247238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Method for Sensor Data Assimilation and Source Characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Data assimilation","Pollution","Meteorology","Calibration","Testing","Monte Carlo methods","Noise robustness","White noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air pollution","data assimilation","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm method","sensor data assimilation","source characterization","transport model","backward model","forward model","dispersion model","receptor model","Gaussian plume dispersion model","Monte Carlo techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Method for Sensor Data Assimilation and Source Characterization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"16-21 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9723414","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Method for Sensor Data Assimilation and Source Characterization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01716809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054792S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11216","isNumber":"36115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"36115","articleId":"1716809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1716813,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The fovea model includes the biological mechanisms of the photoreceptors, the horizontal cells, the ganglions, the bipolar cells, and their cooperation. Thus the model describes the signal processing from the optical stimulation at retina to the output of the ganglion cells.

Both the face detection and gender classification modules employ the same neural network architecture; however, the two modules are trained separately to extract different features for face detection and gender classification.

To achieve the data rates necessary to support such applications within the current regulatory constraints, PLC systems should exploit the inherent characteristics of the power line channel that enable a more aggressive and optimized channel adaptation. One such characteristic is the cyclic variation of the noise power with the phase of the underlying AC line cycle. In this paper, we use extensive channel characterization measurements and analysis to investigate the performance enhancements that can be achieved by using a channel adaptation mechanism that exploits the cyclic variation in power line noise characteristics. The results show that a 30% improvement in physical layer (PHY) data rates can be obtained by continuously adapting to, and synchronizing communications with, the AC line cycle. Since continuous adaptation with respect to time is unduly complex for practical systems, we propose dividing the AC line cycle into multiple regions and adapting independently in each region. Results show that using a region size of 1-2 milliseconds provides optimal MAC throughput on most paths tested","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2006.247430","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11217/36116/01716880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2006.247430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36116","startPage":"16","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Adaptation based on Cyclo-Stationary Noise Characteristics in PLC Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Adaptation based on Cyclo-Stationary Noise Characteristics in PLC Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716880/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 March 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9111378","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1716880/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Adaptation based on Cyclo-Stationary Noise Characteristics in PLC Systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01716880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057163S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11217","isNumber":"36116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11217","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"36116","articleId":"1716880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1716881,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The regulations on power line communication (PLC) may he eased in Japan and we could utilize a frequency band from 2 to 30 MHz in the future. However, this frequency band often suffers from narrowband interference caused by amplitude modulated (AM) broadcasting and/or amateur ham radio. The narrowband interference level may be much higher than the background noise if the interference source is close enough. Therefore, modulation and coding over power line channels are required to have immunity to narrowband interference. Multicarrier modulation (MCM) is expected as one of modulation methods which are robust to narrowband interference. In this paper, we investigate two MCMs, one is OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) with windowing whose window type is a raised cosine window and the other is CMFB (cosine-modulated filter bank) based transmultiplexer, under narrowband interference environments. We compare the performances of these two MCMs over narrowband noise channels by computer simulations. As these results, we show that CMFB transmultiplexer has a better performance than OFDM with windowing under narrowband noise environments","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2006.247436","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11217/36116/01716886.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2006.247436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of CMFB Transmultiplexer for Broadband Power Line Communications under Narrowband Interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716886/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of CMFB Transmultiplexer for Broadband Power Line Communications under Narrowband Interference","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9111383","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716886/","conferenceDate":"26-29 March 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of CMFB Transmultiplexer for Broadband Power Line Communications under Narrowband Interference","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01716886.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073719S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11217","isNumber":"36116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11217","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"36116","articleId":"1716886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716889,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The work is conducted in the framework of the OPERA project and of a research contract with OFCOM. It is the EMC aspects of data transmission over power cables that are essentially are covered in this research. Much of the effort is dedicated to the experimental and theoretical characterization of conducted and radiated emissions from poorly symmetrical cables in the LV and MV networks.

In general, in-home power line networks have various network components which are not related to communications. The power line network includes many electrical appliances without communication facilities, switches, and so on. These components will cause electrical unbalance of the power line network and increase radiated emissions. We investigate that each power line network component has an impact on the electrical unbalance and the radiated emissions quantitatively by an experiment. As the result, we show that the radiated emissions and the electrical unbalance of the network vary significantly as the wired network components. Furthermore, our result indicates that the radiated emission is especially large in the case where the network contains a fluorescent light or a single-pole switch","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/11217/36116/01716931.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2006.247481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2006.247481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1716931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Correlation between Radiated Emissions and Power Line Network Components on Indoor Power Line Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power line communications","Switches","Programmable control","Frequency","Wires","Voltage","Electrical products","Communication switching","Electric variables measurement","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","indoor communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiated emissions","power line network components","indoor power line communications","in-home power line networks","electrical unbalance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1716931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  0","displayDocTitle":"The Correlation between Radiated Emissions and Power Line Network Components on Indoor Power Line Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1716931/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2006","accessionNumber":"9121094","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","conferenceDate":"26-29 March 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Correlation between Radiated Emissions and Power Line Network Components on Indoor Power Line Communications","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01716931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069483S","chronDate":"0-0  0","xplore-pub-id":"11217","isNumber":"36116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11217","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"36116","articleId":"1716931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1716932,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In the proposed scheme, the symbols after decision are remodulated to generate a time domain signal to replace the samples that are degraded by the impulse noise in the time domain.

Performance degradation in the proposed system over impulsive noise channel is mitigated using a simple estimator based on the Gaussian approximation with estimated channel information (ECI) and a signal level limiter. At first, it will be shown that the performance of a conventional LDPC coded OFDM system is seriously degraded due to the imperfection of estimating the initial LLRs (log likelihood ratios) of sum-product decoder over impulsive noise channels and hard evaluation of the initial LLRs from the decentralized noise samples by OFDM demodulator.

To let a long block-length code with a practical buffer delay, we protect all the symbols that are transmitted in a DMT symbol with one code. The main challenge, therefore, is the varying signal to noise ratio in different frequency tones, which normally necessitates using different codes for different frequency tones (according to their signal to noise ratios). We show that if this non-uniformity is considered in the code design process, low-density parity-check codes that approach the capacity of such frequency selective channels can he found. Compared to codes that are designed for uniform channels, our codes have a significantly smaller gap from the capacity. As an extreme case, we focus on systems that - for reducing signalling and detection complexity - use only one non-binary modulation in all frequency tones. Therefore, the soft information at the receiver experiences a dramatic non-uniform quality from bit to bit.

The SNM of SRAM during both hold and read modes is explored for the device with respect to different supply voltage and temperature. Effect of the channel length on the SNM and fluctuation of SNM is further investigated by using a computational statistics technique. Among three devices in the 6T SRAM cell, it is found that 6T SRAM cell with 20 nm nanowire FinFETs possesses the best and stable operation characteristics. SRAM cell fabricated with multiple-gate FinFETs is promising in sub-22 nm CMOS devices.","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2006.247646","publicationTitle":"2006 Sixth IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Sixth IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/11219/36118/01717096.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2006.247646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristic Comparison of SRAM Cells with 20 nm Planar MOSFET, Omega FinFET and Nanowire FinFET","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Characteristic Comparison of SRAM Cells with 20 nm Planar MOSFET, Omega FinFET and Nanowire FinFET","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717096/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"2006","conferenceDate":"17-20 July 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristic Comparison of SRAM Cells with 20 nm Planar MOSFET, Omega FinFET and Nanowire FinFET","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"01717096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064545S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"11219","isNumber":"36118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"11219","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36118","articleId":"1717096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717103,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Details about new roads and the modification or closure of existing roads must be incorporated into the databases in a timely fashion. Mapping organizations obtain data about road network changes from various sources, including local authorities and building contractors, but this data tends to be highly inaccurate. To simplify mapmaking process, vehicles could use their computational resources to directly generate accurate map data. We envisage vehicles on the road network forming a wide-scale mobile sensing and computing platform. Toward that goal, we've developed an algorithm for keeping digital maps up-to-date, using ordinary vehicles making normal journeys rather than fleets of dedicated probe vehicles.

The Mitchell algorithm (MA), proposed, reduces the complexity of finding the logarithms and the antilogarithms using piecewise straight line approximations of the logarithm and the antilogarithm curves. The approximations, however, result in some loss of accuracy. Thus, several methods have been proposed in the literature for improving the accuracy of Mitchell's algorithm. In this work, we investigate a new method based on operand decomposition (OD) to improve the accuracy of Mitchell's algorithm when applied to logarithmic multiplication. In the OD technique proposed, for reducing the amount of switching activity in binary multiplication, the two inputs to be multiplied are together decomposed into four binary operands and the product is expressed as the sum of the products of the decomposed numbers. We show that applying operand decomposition to the inputs as a preprocessing step to Mitchell's multiplication algorithm significantly improves the accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm for logarithmic multiplication reduces the error percentage of Mitchell's algorithm by 44.7 percent on the average. It is also shown that the OD method yields further improvement when combined with the other correction methods proposed in the literature","doi":"10.1109/TC.2006.198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2006.198","startPage":"1523","endPage":"1535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/36126/01717385.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Accuracy in Mitchell's Logarithmic Multiplication Using Operand Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Improving Accuracy in Mitchell's Logarithmic Multiplication Using Operand Decomposition","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9245953","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717385/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Accuracy in Mitchell's Logarithmic Multiplication Using Operand Decomposition","sourcePdf":"01717385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165878S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"36126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"36126","articleId":"1717385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1717387,"authors":[{"name":"Jianbin Wei","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Department, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapids, SD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/36126/1717387/1717387-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianbin Wei received the BS degree in computer science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 1997 and the MS and PhD degrees in computer engineering from Wayne State University in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Existing work focuses on network transfer time or server-side request processing time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, eQoS, to monitor and control client-perceived response time in heavy loaded Web servers. The response time is measured with respect to Web pages that contain multiple embedded objects. Within the framework, we propose an adaptive fuzzy controller, STFC, to allocate server resources. The controller assumes no knowledge of the pageview traffic model. It deals with the effect of process delay in resource allocation by its two-level self-tuning capabilities. We also prove the stability of the STFC. We implement a prototype of eQoS in Linux and conduct comprehensive experiments across wide-range server workload conditions on PlanetLab and simulated networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework: it controls the deviation of client-perceived pageview response time to be within 20 percent of a predefined target with both synthetic and real Web traffics. We also compare the STFC with other controllers, including static fuzzy, linear proportional integral (PI), and adaptive PI controllers. Experimental results show that, although the STFC works slightly worse than the static fuzzy controller in the environment where the static fuzzy controller is best tuned, because of its self-tuning capabilities, it has better performance in all other test cases by around 25 percent on average in terms of the deviation from the target response time. In addition, due to its model independence, the STFC outperforms the linear PI and adaptive PI controllers by 50 percent and 75 percent on average, respectively","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717387/","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1717387/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9245955","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"eQoS: Provisioning of Client-Perceived End-to-End QoS Guarantees in Web Servers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"eQoS: Provisioning of Client-Perceived End-to-End QoS Guarantees in Web Servers","sourcePdf":"01717387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082771S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"36126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"36126","articleId":"1717387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717393,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this work, the initial model of the distributed replication group of Leff et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE] is extended to the case that individual nodes act selfishly, i.e., cater to the optimization of their individual local utilities. Our main contribution is the derivation of equilibrium object placement strategies that 1) can guarantee improved local utilities for all nodes concurrently as compared to the corresponding local utilities under greedy local object placement, 2) do not suffer from potential mistreatment problems, inherent to centralized strategies that aim at optimizing the social utility, and 3) do not require the existence of complete information at all nodes. We develop a baseline computationally efficient algorithm for obtaining the aforementioned equilibrium strategies and then extend it to improve its performance with respect to fairness. Both algorithms are realizable, in practice, through a distributed protocol that requires only a limited exchange of information.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/36127/01717403.pdf","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2006.171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2006.171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Selfish Replication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Costs","IP networks","Bandwidth","Web and internet services","Delay effects","Network servers","Web server","Access protocols","Mirrors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Selfish Replication","volume":"17","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1717403/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Selfish Replication","sourcePdf":"01717403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113242S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"36127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"36127","articleId":"1717403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717404,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

In this model, a threshold-based call admission control (CAC) is used to limit the number of admitted calls in a cell and also to prioritize handoff calls over new calls. The transmission rates for data calls can be adjusted to accommodate more voice and/or data calls while satisfying the minimum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)/ transmission rate requirement. Also, automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based error control is used for improved reliability of data packets. Call-level performance measures for both voice and data calls and packet-level performance measures specifically for data calls can be obtained from the analytical model. The interdependencies among call-level and packet-level QoS metrics are investigated under different CAC, rate adaptation, and error control parameter settings. To this end, the level of users' satisfaction (or user utility) is formulated as a function of the QoS metrics and an optimization formulation is presented to obtain the local-optimal system parameters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call-Level and Packet-Level Quality of Service and User Utility in Rate-Adaptive Cellular CDMA Networks: A Queuing Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.177","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/36129/01717442.pdf","startPage":"1749","endPage":"1763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36129","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Call-Level and Packet-Level Quality of Service and User Utility in Rate-Adaptive Cellular CDMA Networks: A Queuing Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1717442/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9239202","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call-Level and Packet-Level Quality of Service and User Utility in Rate-Adaptive Cellular CDMA Networks: A Queuing Analysis","sourcePdf":"01717442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125872S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"36129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"36129","articleId":"1717442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717443,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jianfeng Wang","id":"37280524100"},{"name":"Hongqiang Zhai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Hongqiang Zhai","id":"37281331000"},{"name":"Yuguang Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Yuguang Fang","id":"37281336600"},{"name":"J.M.

Although it has been widely investigated and shown feasible and efficient in cellular networks, there is little work for the ad hoc networks, especially in real protocol and algorithm design. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, namely, the opportunistic medium access and auto rate (OMAR), to efficiently utilize the shared medium in IEEE 802.11-based ad hoc networks by taking advantage of diversity, distributed scheduling, and adaptivity. In an ad hoc network, especially in a heterogeneous ad hoc network or a mesh network, some nodes may need to communicate with multiple one-hop nodes. We allow such a node with a certain number of links to function as a clusterhead to locally coordinate multiuser communications. We introduce a CDF-based (cumulative distribution function) K-ary opportunistic splitting algorithm and a distributed stochastic scheduling algorithm to resolve intra and intercluster collisions, respectively. Fairness is formulated and solved in terms of social optimality within and across clusters.

We address the emerging resource allocation problem in that context and consider maximizing the total achievable user rate while satisfying minimum rate requirements of users. We devise symbol-synchronous and asynchronous models that capture different communication scenarios. The synchronous model holds for down-link transmission in one cell. The asynchronous model captures up-link single-cell communication and down-link or up-link scenarios in multicell systems. It can also account for multipath with each path corresponding to a virtual user. We propose a class of two-stage resource allocation algorithms. First, an admissible set of codes is constructed with criteria that capture code cross-correlation, induced interference to the system, and code rates. Next, the codes are allocated to users so as to satisfy their rate requirements. In the synchronous case, the problem structure allows the distinction of the two stages. In the asynchronous case, this distinction is not feasible due to different user delay profiles perceived at the receiver. Our models and numerical results indicate interesting trends and lead to useful conclusions and design guidelines for resource allocation algorithms under the aforementioned regimes","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2006.184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/36129/01717444.pdf","startPage":"1780","endPage":"1792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2006.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation in CDMA Systems with Deterministic Codes and Multirate Provisioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717444/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation in CDMA Systems with Deterministic Codes and Multirate Provisioning","volume":"5","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9239204","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717444/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation in CDMA Systems with Deterministic Codes and Multirate Provisioning","sourcePdf":"01717444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059381S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"36129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"36129","articleId":"1717444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717451,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.J.

Such implementations necessitate large-scale capture and storage of biometric data, which raises serious issues in terms of data privacy and (if such data is compromised) identity theft. These problems stem from the essential permanence of biometric data, which (unlike secret passwords or physical tokens) cannot be refreshed or reissued if compromised. Our previously presented biometric-hash framework prescribes the integration of external (password or token-derived) randomness with user-specific biometrics, resulting in bitstring outputs with security characteristics (i.e., noninvertibility) comparable to cryptographic ciphers or hashes. The resultant BioHashes are hence cancellable, i.e., straightforwardly revoked and reissued (via refreshed password or reissued token) if compromised. BioHashing furthermore enhances recognition effectiveness, which is explained in this paper as arising from the random multispace quantization (RMQ) of biometric and external random inputs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/36130/01717451.pdf","startPage":"1892","endPage":"1901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36130","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Biometrics","Bioinformatics","Cryptography","Fingerprint recognition","Protection","Iris","Testing","Security","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","biometrics (access control)","cryptography","data privacy","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random multispace quantization","analytic mechanism","BioHashing","random identity inputs","biometric analysis","identity verification","biometric data","data privacy","identity theft","biometric-hash framework","user-specific biometrics","cryptographic ciphers","cancellable biometrics","face recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cancellable biometrics","BioHashing","random multispace quantization","face recognition."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Computer Security","Data Compression","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Database Management Systems","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs","volume":"28","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1717451/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9236587","pubMedId":"17108365","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs","sourcePdf":"01717451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082038S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"36130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"285","xplore-issue":"36130","articleId":"1717451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1717452,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

Often, vendors and owners of these commercial biometric systems claim impressive performance that is estimated based on some proprietary data. In such situations, there is a need to independently validate the claimed performance levels. System performance is typically evaluated by collecting biometric templates from n different subjects, and for convenience, acquiring multiple instances of the biometric for each of the n subjects. Very little work has been done in 1) constructing confidence regions based on the ROC curve for validating the claimed performance levels and 2) determining the required number of biometric samples needed to establish confidence regions of prespecified width for the ROC curve. To simplify the analysis that address these two problems, several previous studies have assumed that multiple acquisitions of the biometric entity are statistically independent. This assumption is too restrictive and is generally not valid. We have developed a validation technique based on multivariate copula models for correlated biometric acquisitions. Based on the same model, we also determine the minimum number of samples required to achieve confidence bands of desired width for the ROC curve. We illustrate the estimation of the confidence bands as well as the required number of biometric samples using a fingerprint matching system that is applied on samples collected from a small population.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2006.255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2006.255","startPage":"1902","endPage":"1319","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/36130/01717452.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validating a Biometric Authentication System: Sample Size Requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Validating a Biometric Authentication System: Sample Size Requirements","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","volume":"28","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717452/","accessionNumber":"9236588","pubMedId":"17108366","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717452/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validating a Biometric Authentication System: Sample Size Requirements","sourcePdf":"01717452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131724S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"36130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"36130","articleId":"1717452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1717456,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Existing algorithms for tracking and data association, initially applied to radar tracking, do not adequately address these types of measurements. Here, we introduce a probabilistic model for interacting targets that addresses both types of measurements simultaneously. We provide an algorithm for approximate inference in this model using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based auxiliary variable particle filter. We Rao-Blackwellize the Markov chain to eliminate sampling over the continuous state space of the targets. A major contribution of this work is the use of sparse least squares updating and downdating techniques, which significantly reduce the computational cost per iteration of the Markov chain. Also, when combined with a simple heuristic, they enable the algorithm to correctly focus computation on interacting targets. We include experimental results on a challenging simulation sequence. We test the accuracy of the algorithm using two sensor modalities, video, and laser range data.

Both the stability limit and the numerical dispersion of the symplectic FDTD are determined by a function zeta. It is shown that when the zeta function is a Chebyshev polynomial the stability limit is linearly proportional to the number of the exponential operators. Thus, the stability limit can be increased as much as possible at the cost of increased number of operators. For example, the stability limit of the four-exponential operator scheme is 0.989 and of the eight-exponential operator scheme it is 1.979 for fourth-order space discretization in three dimensions, which is almost three times the stability limit of previously published symplectic FDTD schemes with a similar number of operators. This study also shows that the numerical dispersion errors for this new scheme are less than those of the previously reported symplectic FDTD schemes","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2006.884770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/36133/01717509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2006.884770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36133","startPage":"579","endPage":"581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Higher Stability Limits for the Symplectic FDTD Method by Making Use of Chebyshev Polynomials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Higher Stability Limits for the Symplectic FDTD Method by Making Use of Chebyshev Polynomials","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9160693","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717509/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher Stability Limits for the Symplectic FDTD Method by Making Use of Chebyshev Polynomials","sourcePdf":"01717509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10073S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"36133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"36133","articleId":"1717509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1717511,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The D-CRLH is the \"dual\" of the conventional CRLH in the sense that it has a series parallel (instead of series) LC tank and a shunt series (instead of parallel) LC tank. This topological duality results in dual properties. The D-CRLH indeed exhibits its left-handed (LH) band at high frequencies and its right-handed (RH) band at low frequencies and is of stop-band nature, in opposition to the CRLH which is low-frequency-LH/high-frequency-RH and pass-band. The so-called balanced condition is still valid in the D-CRLH for broadband matching. However, phase origin is at dc and infinity instead, as at the LH-RH transition, and the gap between the RH and LH bands cannot be closed up in practical implementations. In contrast, the D-CRLH provides an unlimited LH bandwidth. This letter presents the homogeneous and LC-network transmission parameters and the fundamental dispersion/impedance properties of the D-CRLH","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission lines","Metamaterials","Impedance","Frequency","Distributed parameter circuits","Equivalent circuits","Propagation constant","Attenuation","H infinity control","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite materials","metamaterials","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite material","right handed material","left handed material","transmission line metamaterial","topological duality","homogeneous transmission parameters","LC-network transmission parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Composite right/left-handed (CRLH)","dual CRLH (D-CRLH)","left-handed (LH)","metamaterials","right-handed (RH)","transmission lines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2006.884773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/36133/01717511.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2006.884773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual Composite Right/Left-Handed (D-CRLH) Transmission Line Metamaterial","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual Composite Right/Left-Handed (D-CRLH) Transmission Line Metamaterial","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717511/","volume":"16","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717511/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9160695","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual Composite Right/Left-Handed (D-CRLH) Transmission Line Metamaterial","sourcePdf":"01717511.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034063S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"36133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"36133","articleId":"1717511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":1717512,"authors":[{"name":"A.

After being trained with wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) (3GPP Uplink) signals, the proposed model is validated with not only W-CDMA but also high-speed downlink packet access (3GPP Uplink) signals with higher peak-to-average ratios (PARs), which demonstrates the generality of the model.

Since ISO NE's real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, ex post pricing is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for ex post pricing requires defining complex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid complexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new ex post pricing schema is proposed to calculate the ex post energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve. In the proposed approach, ex post energy prices are first computed by incorporating the ex ante marginal opportunity cost of reserve in the energy offer; the ex post reserve prices are then calculated by considering the ex post marginal opportunity cost of energy.

Independent system operators (ISOs) perform optimizations based on a market-driven objective function. However, there may be other objectives that the ISO wishes to consider.

In this paper, a hierarchical multiobjective (HMO) optimization is developed that, through coordinated control of network devices such as phase shifting transformers and series flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS), allows the market objective to be optimized in a global sense, while the secondary objectives are locally optimized. The method is applied to a modified IEEE 30-bus system incorporating a wide-area impact index-minimizing secondary objective. Formulated in this paper, the wide-area impact index accurately measures the effects of parallel flow over multiple lines in a region.

The model of the producer surplus maximization is a bilevel mathematical programming problem within which the market clearing is taken into account. By using the deterministic approaches, it is difficult to obtain the global solution of the bilevel optimization problem, even for a single hourly market clearing. This is due to the fact that the objective function of such a problem is not concave, and there are nonlinear complementarity terms introduced by using the KKT conditions to represent the market clearing. When the bilevel optimization problem is modified to consider multiple hourly market clearings, such as to maximize the total producer surplus in one day, solving such a problem is almost intractable. A heuristic approach should be another option. For its simplicity and immunity to the local optimum, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed in this paper to find the optimal supply function of the electricity producer. Based on the IEEE 30-bus test system, different simulation cases with respect to a single hourly market clearing and a daily market clearing are tested to show the efficiency and robustness of the PSO algorithm. In addition, the parameterization techniques used in formulating the optimal supply function are analyzed based on the simulation results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9160525","htmlLink":"/document/1717569/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Formulation of the Optimal Strategies for the Electricity Producers Based on the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Formulation of the Optimal Strategies for the Electricity Producers Based on the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"01717569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147124S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"36135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"36135","articleId":"1717569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1717570,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

These market participants can achieve an interesting benefit through the knowledge of these patterns, for example, to evaluate the potential for distributed generation, energy efficiency, and demand-side response policies (market analysis). For simplicity, customer classification techniques usually used the historic load curves of each user. The first step in the methodology presented in this paper is anomalous data filtering: holidays, maintenance, and wrong measurements must be removed from the database. Subsequently, two different treatments (frequency and time domain) of demand data were tested to feed SOM maps and evaluate the advantages of each approach. Finally, the ability of SOM to classify new customers in different clusters is also examined. Both steps have been performed through a well-known technique: SOM maps. The results clearly show the suitability of this approach to improve data management and to easily find coherent clusters between electrical users, accounting for relevant information about weekend demand patterns","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.881133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/36135/01717570.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.881133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification, Filtering, and Identification of Electrical Customer Load Patterns Through the Use of Self-Organizing Maps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717570/","displayDocTitle":"Classification, Filtering, and Identification of Electrical Customer Load Patterns Through the Use of Self-Organizing Maps","volume":"21","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9160526","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717570/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification, Filtering, and Identification of Electrical Customer Load Patterns Through the Use of Self-Organizing Maps","sourcePdf":"01717570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078182S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"36135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"36135","articleId":"1717570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1717571,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

An effective method to model weather's impact on overhead distribution lines' failure rates will enable utilities to compare their systems' reliabilities under different weather conditions.

Two methods to model overhead distribution lines' failure rates are presented in this paper. The first is based on a Poisson regression model, and it captures the counting nature of failure events on overhead distribution lines. The second is a Bayesian network model, which uses conditional probabilities of failures given different weather states. Both methods are used to predict the yearly weather-related failure events on overhead lines. This is followed by a Monte Carlo analysis to determine prediction bounds.

The emphasis is primarily on electronically interfaced DG (EI-DG) units. DG controls and power management strategies are based on locally measured signals without communications. Based on the reactive power controls adopted, three power management strategies are identified and investigated. These strategies are based on 1) voltage-droop characteristic, 2) voltage regulation, and 3) load reactive power compensation. The real power of each DG unit is controlled based on a frequency-droop characteristic and a complimentary frequency restoration strategy. A systematic approach to develop a small-signal dynamic model of a multiple-DG microgrid, including real and reactive power management strategies, is also presented. The microgrid eigen structure, based on the developed model, is used to 1) investigate the microgrid dynamic behavior, 2) select control parameters of DG units, and 3) incorporate power management strategies in the DG controllers. The model is also used to investigate sensitivity of the design to changes of parameters and operating point and to optimize performance of the microgrid system.

The proposed technique is applied to a 30 000-bus, 5000-generator, 2004 summer peak load, Eastern Interconnection data and demonstrated on the August 14, 2003 blackout scenario. Adaptive rate of frequency decline-based load shedding schemes are used in the load rich islands to control frequency. The simulation results presented show the advantage of the proposed method in containing the impact of the disturbance within the islands formed and in preventing the impact of the disturbance from propagating to the rest of the system. This is demonstrated by the significant reduction in line flows in the rest of the system and by improved voltage and relative angle characteristics. Based on the suggestion in the joint U.S.-Canadian task force final report on the blackout, load shedding without any islanding is also performed, and results obtained are compared with the proposed controlled islanding method. The islanding method outperforms the load shedding-only method in reducing the transmission line flows, but both methods have similar effects on voltage and relative angle behavior","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow-Coherency-Based Controlled Islanding\u2014A Demonstration of the Approach on the August 14, 2003 Blackout Scenario","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.881126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/36135/01717588.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.881126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717588","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Slow-Coherency-Based Controlled Islanding\u2014A Demonstration of the Approach on the August 14, 2003 Blackout Scenario","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1717588/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9160544","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow-Coherency-Based Controlled Islanding\u2014A Demonstration of the Approach on the August 14, 2003 Blackout Scenario","sourcePdf":"01717588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037506S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"36135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"36135","articleId":"1717588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1717591,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

This paper first proposes a new load model, which is based on a particular form of artificial neural networks we denote as adaptive back-propagation (ABP) network for nonparametric models. ABP can overcome some shortcomings of common back-propagation (BP), and the ABP load models offer several advantages over traditional load models as they are nonstructural and can be derived quickly. The application of the method is illustrated using actual field test data from Northeast China to Shanghai, one of the biggest cities in China. The load models so obtained are shown to replicate the test measurements more closely than those based on traditional load models. Second, extension of the method to the determination of the parameters of the traditional load models is also proposed. It is based on a linear back-propagation (LBP) network. The proposed LBP for parametric load model is incorporated in a transient stability program to show that not only the computational time is significantly reduced, but also the accuracy of identification is improved.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2006.882452","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/36135/01717591.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2006.882452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Load Modeling Approaches Based on Field Tests for Fast Transient Stability Calculations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Power system modeling","Power system transients","Power system stability","Artificial neural networks","System testing","Power system simulation","Transformers","Load management","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","power system analysis computing","power system interconnection","power system transient stability","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Adaptive back-propagation (ABP) networks","artificial neural networks","field tests","linear back-propagation (LBP) networks","load modeling","transient stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive back-propagation (ABP) networks","artificial neural networks","field tests","linear back-propagation (LBP) networks","load modeling","transient stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"New Load Modeling Approaches Based on Field Tests for Fast Transient Stability Calculations","volume":"21","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1717591/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","accessionNumber":"9160547","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Load Modeling Approaches Based on Field Tests for Fast Transient Stability Calculations","sourcePdf":"01717591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05705S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"36135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"36135","articleId":"1717591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1717593,"authors":[{"name":"G.

One of the most natural applications of these measurements is in the area of state estimation. A straightforward application of state estimation theory treats phasor measurements of currents and voltages as additional measurements to be appended to traditional measurements now being used in most energy management system (EMS) state estimators. The resulting state estimator is once again nonlinear and requires significant modifications to existing EMS software. This paper proposes an alternative approach, which leaves the traditional state estimation software in place, and discusses a novel method of incorporating the phasor measurements and the results of the traditional state estimator in a postprocessing linear estimator. This paper presents the underlying theory and provides verification through simulations of the two alternative strategies.

Equipping wireless routers with multiple radios further improves the capacity by transmitting over multiple radios simultaneously using orthogonal channels. Efficient channel assignment and routing is essential for throughput optimization of mesh clients. Efficient channel assignment schemes can greatly relieve the interference effect of close-by transmissions; effective routing schemes can alleviate potential congestion on any gateways to the Internet, thereby improving per-client throughput. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we mathematically formulate the joint channel assignment and routing problem, taking into account the interference constraints, the number of channels in the network, and the number of radios available at each mesh router. We then use this formulation to develop a solution for our problem that optimizes the overall network throughput subject to fairness constraints on allocation of scarce wireless capacity among mobile clients. We show that the performance of our algorithms is within a constant factor of that of any optimal algorithm for the joint channel assignment and routing problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm can effectively exploit the increased number of channels and radios, and it performs much better than the theoretical worst case bounds","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.881641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/36136/01717611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.881641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36136","startPage":"1960","endPage":"1971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Assignment and Routing for Throughput Optimization in Multiradio Wireless Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Assignment and Routing for Throughput Optimization in Multiradio Wireless Mesh Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9147182","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717611/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Assignment and Routing for Throughput Optimization in Multiradio Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"01717611.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089125S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"36136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"36136","articleId":"1717611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1717616,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Three key factors that affect the usability of WMNs are high throughput, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployability. In this paper, we propose DMesh, a WMN architecture that combines spatial separation from directional antennas with frequency separation from orthogonal channels to improve the throughput of WMNs. DMesh achieves this improvement without inhibiting cost-effectiveness and ease of deployability by utilizing practical directional antennas that are widely and cheaply available (e.g., patch and yagi) in contrast to costly and bulky smart beamforming directional antennas. Thus, the key challenge in DMesh is to exploit spatial separation from such practical directional antennas despite their lack of electronic steerability and interference nulling, as well as the presence of significant sidelobes and backlobes. In this paper, we study how such practical directional antennas can improve the throughput of a WMN. Central to our architecture is a distributed, directional channel assignment algorithm for mesh routers that effectively exploits the spatial and frequency separation opportunities in a DMesh network. Simulation results show that DMesh improves the throughput of WMNs by up to 231% and reduces packet delay drastically compared to a multiradio multichannel omni antenna network. A DMesh implementation in our 16-node 802.11b WMN testbed using commercially available practical directional antennas provides transmission control protocol throughput gains ranging from 31% to 57%","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717617/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9147188","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DMesh: Incorporating Practical Directional Antennas in Multichannel Wireless Mesh Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DMesh: Incorporating Practical Directional Antennas in Multichannel Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"01717617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081594S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"36136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"36136","articleId":"1717617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1717618,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

For the proposed scheme, instead of making a decision on the transmitted information symbols at the relay as in perfect DTC, we calculate and forward the corresponding soft information. We derive parity symbol soft estimates for the interleaved source information when only the a posteriori probabilities of the information symbols are known.

In WMNs, since not all the information necessary for scheduling is available at a central scheduler (e.g., MR), it is advantageous to involve the MR and as many mesh clients as possible in distributed scheduling based on the limited information that is available locally at each node. Instead of solving a single global control problem, we hierarchically decouple the subcarrier and power allocation problem into two subproblems, where the MR allocates groups of subcarriers to the mesh clients, and each mesh client allocates transmit power among its subcarriers to each of its outgoing links. We formulate the two subproblems by nonlinear integer programming and nonlinear mixed integer programming, respectively. A simple and efficient solution algorithm is developed for the MR's problem. Also, a closed-form solution is obtained by transforming the mesh client's problem into a time-division scheduling problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides fair opportunities to the respective users (mesh clients) and a comparable overall end-to-end rate when the number of mesh clients increases","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.881628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/36136/01717619.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.881628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36136","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair Allocation of Subcarrier and Power in an OFDMA Wireless Mesh Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fair Allocation of Subcarrier and Power in an OFDMA Wireless Mesh Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9147190","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717619/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair Allocation of Subcarrier and Power in an OFDMA Wireless Mesh Network","sourcePdf":"01717619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112744S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"36136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"36136","articleId":"1717619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717620,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The situation is exacerbated in a wireless setting due to the interference among local wireless transmissions. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization framework for throughput maximization in wireless mesh networks, in which the data routing problem and the wireless medium contention problem are jointly optimized for multihop multicast. We show that the throughput maximization problem can be decomposed into two subproblems: a data routing subproblem at the network layer, and a power control subproblem at the physical layer with a set of Lagrangian dual variables coordinating interlayer coupling. Various effective solutions are discussed for each subproblem. We emphasize the network coding technique for multicast routing and a game theoretic method for interference management, for which efficient and distributed solutions are derived and illustrated.

We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using both analysis and simulation, and show that it outperforms other alternative schemes by comparing the number of gateways placed in different scenarios","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.881606","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/36136/01717626.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.881606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gateway Placement Optimization in Wireless Mesh Networks With QoS Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","displayDocTitle":"Gateway Placement Optimization in Wireless Mesh Networks With QoS Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717626/","volume":"24","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1717626/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9147197","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gateway Placement Optimization in Wireless Mesh Networks With QoS Constraints","sourcePdf":"01717626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073945S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"36136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"36136","articleId":"1717626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1717627,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Nevertheless, due to the inherent drawbacks of multihop relaying, e.g., the requirement for extra radio resources for relaying hops, and the sensitivity to the quality of relaying routes, multihop cellular networks (MCNs) require a well-designed radio resource allocation strategy in order to secure performance gains. In this paper, the optimal radio resource allocation problem in MCNs, with the objective of throughput maximization, is formulated mathematically and proven to be NP-hard. Considering the prohibitive complexity of finding the optimal solution for such an NP-hard problem, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, named integrated radio resource allocation (IRRA), to find suboptimal solutions. The IRRA is featured as a low-complexity algorithm that involves not only base station (BS) resource scheduling, but also routing and relay station (RS) load balancing. Specifically, a load-based scheme is developed for routing. A mode-aware BS resource-scheduling scheme is proposed for handling links in different transmission modes, i.e., direct or multihop. Moreover, a priority-based RS load balancing approach is presented for the prevention of the overloading of RSs. Within the framework of the IRRA, the above three functions operate periodically with coordinated interactions. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed IRRA algorithm, a case study was carried out based on enhanced uplink UMTS terrestrial radio access/frequency-division duplex with fixed RSs. The IRRA is evaluated through system level simulations, and compared with two other cases: 1) nonrelaying and 2) relaying with a benchmark approach. The results show that the proposed algorithm can ensure significant gains in terms of cell throughput","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Radio Resource Allocation for Multihop Cellular Networks With Fixed Relay Stations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2006.881603","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/36136/01717627.pdf","startPage":"2137","endPage":"2146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2006.881603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36136","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Radio Resource Allocation for Multihop Cellular Networks With Fixed Relay Stations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1717627/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9147198","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Radio Resource Allocation for Multihop Cellular Networks With Fixed Relay Stations","sourcePdf":"01717627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143456S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"36136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"36136","articleId":"1717627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1717639,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this paper, we present the construction of 20 realistic digital brain phantoms that can be used to simulate medical imaging data. The phantoms are made from 20 normal adults to take into account intersubject anatomical variabilities. Each digital brain phantom was created by registering and averaging four T1, T2, and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from each subject. A fuzzy minimum distance classification was used to classify voxel intensities from T1, T2, and PD average volumes into grey-matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, and fat. Automatically generated mask volumes were required to separate brain from nonbrain structures and ten fuzzy tissue volumes were created: grey matter, white matter, cerebro-spinal fluid, skull, marrow within the bone, dura, fat, tissue around the fat, muscles, and skin/muscles. A fuzzy vessel class was also obtained from the segmentation of the magnetic resonance angiography scan of the subject. These eleven fuzzy volumes that describe the spatial distribution of anatomical tissues define the digital phantom, where voxel intensity is proportional to the fraction of tissue within the voxel. These fuzzy volumes can be used to drive simulators for different modalities including MRI, PET, or SPECT. These phantoms were used to construct 20 simulated T1-weighted MR scans. To evaluate the realism of these simulations, we propose two approaches to compare them to real data acquired with the same acquisition parameters. The first approach consists of comparing the intensities within the segmented classes in both real and simulated data. In the second approach, a whole brain voxel-wise comparison between simulations and real T1-weighted data is performed. The first comparison underlines that segmented classes appear to properly represent the anatomy on average, and that inside these classes, the simulated and real intensity values are quite similar. The second comparison enables the study of the regional variations with no a priori class. The experiments demonstrate that these variations are small when real data are corrected for intensity nonuniformity.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2006.883453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2006.883453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36137","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/36137/01717639.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging phantoms","Brain modeling","Magnetic resonance imaging","Medical simulation","Muscles","Testing","Image processing","Biomedical imaging","Protons","Skull"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","bone","brain","fuzzy set theory","image segmentation","medical image processing","muscle","neurophysiology","PACS","phantoms","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brain","digital phantom","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","simulation","validation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain","digital phantom","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","simulation","validation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Brain","Databases, Factual","Female","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Male","Medical Records Systems, Computerized","Models, Anatomic","Models, Neurological","Phantoms, Imaging","Reference Values","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Twenty New Digital Brain Phantoms for Creation of Validation Image Data Bases","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717639/","volume":"25","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1717639/","accessionNumber":"9158003","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"17117770","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twenty New Digital Brain Phantoms for Creation of Validation Image Data Bases","sourcePdf":"01717639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054031S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"36137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"36137","articleId":"1717639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":1717640,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Several techniques have been used to measure atrophy in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, but it is extremely difficult to compare their performance since they have been applied to different patient populations. Furthermore, assessment of performance based on phantom measurements or simple scaled images overestimates these techniques' ability to capture the complexity of neurodegeneration of the human brain. We propose a method for atrophy simulation in structural magnetic resonance (MR) images based on finite-element methods. The method produces cohorts of brain images with known change that is physically and clinically plausible, providing data for objective evaluation of atrophy measurement techniques. Atrophy is simulated in different tissue compartments or in different neuroanatomical structures with a phenomenological model. This model of diffuse global and regional atrophy is based on volumetric measurements such as the brain or the hippocampus, from patients with known disease and guided by clinical knowledge of the relative pathological involvement of regions and tissues. The consequent biomechanical readjustment of structures is modelled using conventional physics-based techniques based on biomechanical tissue properties and simulating plausible tissue deformations with finite-element methods. A thermoelastic model of tissue deformation is employed, controlling the rate of progression of atrophy by means of a set of thermal coefficients, each one corresponding to a different type of tissue. Tissue characterization is performed by means of the meshing of a labelled brain atlas, creating a reference volumetric mesh that will be introduced to a finite-element solver to create the simulated deformations. Preliminary work on the simulation of acquisition artefacts is also presented. Cross-sectional and longitudinal sets of simulated data are shown and a visual classification protocol has been used by experts to rate real and simulated scans according to their degree of atrophy.

Modern studies can include multiple labels defined on multiple images yet most evaluation schemes report one overlap per labelled region, simply averaged over multiple images. In this paper, common overlap measures are generalized to measure the total overlap of ensembles of labels defined on multiple test images and account for fractional labels using fuzzy set theory. This framework allows a single \"figure-of-merit\" to be reported which summarises the results of a complex experiment by image pair, by label or overall. A complementary measure of error, the overlap distance, is defined which captures the spatial extent of the nonoverlapping part and is related to the Hausdorff distance computed on grey level images. The generalized overlap measures are validated on synthetic images for which the overlap can be computed analytically and used as similarity measures in nonrigid registration of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Finally, a pragmatic segmentation ground truth is constructed by registering a magnetic resonance atlas brain to 20 individual scans, and used with the overlap measures to evaluate publicly available brain segmentation algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9158007","pubMedId":"17117774","volume":"25","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1717643/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized Overlap Measures for Evaluation and Validation in Medical Image Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Overlap Measures for Evaluation and Validation in Medical Image Analysis","sourcePdf":"01717643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078849S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"36137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"400","xplore-issue":"36137","articleId":"1717643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1717659,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A DTMOS transistor is a device whose gate is tied to its bulk. DTMOS transistor pseudo-pMOS differential input pairs are used for input common-mode range enhancement, followed by a single ended class-AB output. Two versions of the proposed opamp (opamp-A and opamp-B) were fabricated in a standard 0.18-mum CMOS process technology. Measurements under 5 pF and 10 kOmega load conditions gave, for opamp-A, a DC open-loop gain of 50.1 dB, and a unity gain bandwidth (GBW) of 26.2 MHz. A common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 78 dB, and input and output swings of 0.7 V and 0.9 V, respectively, were achieved. Opamp-B has been optimized for biomedical applications, and is implemented to build the analog front-end part of a near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS) receiver of a multi-wavelength wireless brain oxymeter apparatus. A DC open-loop gain of 53 dB, a GBW of 1.3 MHz, and input and output swings of 0.6 V and 0.8 V, respectively, were measured. Opamp-A consumes 550 muW with an input referred noise of 160 nV/radicHz at 1 kHz.

These decoders are used to efficiently decode the best known error correcting codes such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and turbo codes. The proposed circuits are devised based on current mirrors, and thus, in any fabrication technology that accurate current mirrors can be designed, analog MS decoders can be implemented. The functionality of the proposed circuits is verified by implementing an analog MS decoder for a (32,8) LDPC code in a 0.18-mum CMOS technology. This decoder is the first reported analog MS decoder. For low signal to noise ratios where the circuit imperfections are dominated by the noise of the channel, the measured error correcting performance of this chip in steady-state condition surpasses that of the conventional floating-point discrete-time synchronous MS decoder.

However, most of the observations were obtained in areas downwind of the source regions. In this paper, the newly developed satellite aerosol algorithm called \"Deep Blue\" was employed to characterize the properties of aerosols over source regions using radiance measurements from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Based upon the Aringngstroumlm exponent derived from the Deep Blue algorithm, it was demonstrated that this new algorithm is able to distinguish dust plumes from fine-mode pollution particles even in complex aerosol environments such as the one over Beijing. Furthermore, these results were validated by comparing them with observations from AERONET sites in China and Mongolia during spring 2001. These comparisons show that the values of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical thickness from Deep Blue are generally within 20%-30% of those measured by sunphotometers. The analyses also indicate that the roles of mineral dust and anthropogenic particles are comparable in contributing to the overall aerosol distributions during spring in northern China, while fine-mode particles are dominant over southern China. The spring season in East Asia consists of one of the most complex environments in terms of frequent cloudiness and wide ranges of aerosol loadings and types. This paper will discuss how the factors contributing to this complexity influence the resulting aerosol monthly averages from various satellite sensors and, thus, the synergy among satellite aerosol products","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.879540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/36139/01717707.pdf","startPage":"3180","endPage":"3195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.879540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Blue Retrievals of Asian Aerosol Properties During ACE-Asia","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717707/","displayDocTitle":"Deep Blue Retrievals of Asian Aerosol Properties During ACE-Asia","volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9159797","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717707/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Blue Retrievals of Asian Aerosol Properties During ACE-Asia","sourcePdf":"01717707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106959S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"36139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"514","xplore-issue":"36139","articleId":"1717707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":1717708,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such a simple scheme generally works well over the open oceans where Case-1 waters and maritime aerosols are usually the case. However, in coastal regions, there are often cases with significant ocean contributions at the NIR wavelengths from the turbid waters. In addition, aerosols are likely to be dominated with small particles (large Aringngstrom exponent). In these cases, the cloud-masking scheme using the NIR reflectance threshold often mistakenly identifies these scenes as clouds, leading to significant loss of coverage in coastal regions. In this paper, we propose to use the MODIS short wave infrared (SWIR) bands at either 1240 or 1640 nm for detecting clouds. Ocean is black for turbid waters at SWIR wavelengths due to much stronger water absorption. The aerosol contribution in the SWIR bands is also significantly lower for nonabsorbing and weakly absorbing aerosols with small aerosol particle size. Thus, using the SWIR reflectance threshold, the performance of the cloud-masking algorithm in the coastal region is much better than that of using the NIR band. For sensors that do not have SWIR bands (e.g., SeaWiFS), we propose to use the Rayleigh-corrected (RC) reflectance ratio value from two NIR bands in addition to the reflectance threshold at 865 nm. The clouds are spectrally flat and have lower reflectance ratio values from two NIR measurements than cases with reflectance contributions from ocean and aerosols. It was found that, corresponding to the RC reflectance threshold of 2.7% at 869 nm, the RC threshold reflectances for 1240 and 1640 nm are 2.35% and 2.15%, respectively. The cloud-masking performance with the SWIR bands in the coastal region can usually be achieved using the RC reflectance ratio value (ges 1.15 as clear atmosphere) between two NIR bands in addition to the reflectance threshold at 869 nm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","volume":"44","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"9149328","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717708/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Masking for Ocean Color Data Processing in the Coastal Regions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Masking for Ocean Color Data Processing in the Coastal Regions","sourcePdf":"01717708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076503S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"36139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"36139","articleId":"1717708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1717720,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The method is based on recent developments in statistical learning theory concerning transductive inference and in particular transductive SVMs (TSVMs). TSVMs exploit specific iterative algorithms which gradually search a reliable separating hyperplane (in the kernel space) with a transductive process that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training phase. Based on an analysis of the properties of the TSVMs presented in the literature, a novel modified TSVM classifier designed for addressing ill-posed remote-sensing problems is proposed. In particular, the proposed technique: 1) is based on a novel transductive procedure that exploits a weighting strategy for unlabeled patterns, based on a time-dependent criterion; 2) is able to mitigate the effects of suboptimal model selection (which is unavoidable in the presence of small-size training sets); and 3) can address multiclass cases.

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization method","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/36140/01717732.pdf","startPage":"3374","endPage":"3385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.880628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717732/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1717732/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9149307","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"01717732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082025S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"36140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"302","xplore-issue":"36140","articleId":"1717732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":1717733,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It has been argued in the literature that class-conditional distributions of hyperspectral images are non-Gaussian; thus, multiple components might be needed to describe the classes accurately.

Any combination of these parameters can be common for any subset of the covariance matrices, allowing a flexible set of possible configurations that can be used to approximate the true covariance using fewer parameters. A simple bottom-up algorithm for searching for possible parameter-sharing models is developed.

However, two issues arising in EEAs have not been addressed: one is the knowledge of the number of endmembers that must be provided \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n, and the other is the initialization of EEAs, where most EEAs initialize their endmember-searching processes by using randomly generated endmembers, which generally result in inconsistent final selected endmembers. Unfortunately, there has been no previous work reported on how to address these two issues, i.e., how to select a set of appropriate initial endmembers and how to determine the number of endmembers p. This paper takes up these two issues and describes two-stage processes to improve EEAs. First, a recently developed concept of virtual dimensionality (VD) is used to determine how many endmembers are needed to be generated for an EEA. Experiments show that the VD is an adequate measure for estimating p. Second, since EEAs are sensitive to initial endmembers, a properly selected set of initial endmembers can make significant improvements on the searching process. In doing so, a new concept of endmember initialization algorithm (EIA) is thus proposed, and four different algorithms are suggested for this purpose. It is surprisingly found that many EIA-generated initial endmembers turn out to be the final desired endmembers. A further objective is to demonstrate that EEAs implemented in conjunction with EIA-generated initial endmembers can significantly reduce the number of endmember replacements as well as the computing time during endmember search","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.879538","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/36140/01717734.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.879538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36140","startPage":"3397","endPage":"3407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Initialization on Design of Endmember Extraction Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Initialization on Design of Endmember Extraction Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9149309","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717734/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Initialization on Design of Endmember Extraction Algorithms","sourcePdf":"01717734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077508S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"36140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"36140","articleId":"1717734","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1717735,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In addition, the spectral signatures of a given class vary with location and/or time. Therefore, successful adaptation of a classifier designed from the available labeled data to classify new hyperspectral images acquired over other geographic locations or subsequent times is difficult, if minimal additional labeled data are available. In this paper, the binary hierarchical classifier is used to propose a knowledge transfer framework that leverages the information extracted from the existing labeled data to classify spatially separate and multitemporal test data. Experimental results show that in the absence of any labeled data in the new area, the approach is better than a direct application of the original classifier on the new data. Moreover, when small amounts of the labeled data are available from the new area, the framework offers further improvements through semisupervised learning mechanisms and compares favorably with previously proposed methods","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.878442","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/36140/01717735.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.878442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36140","startPage":"3408","endPage":"3417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Class Hierarchies for Knowledge Transfer in Hyperspectral Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Class Hierarchies for Knowledge Transfer in Hyperspectral Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717735/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9149310","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717735/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Class Hierarchies for Knowledge Transfer in Hyperspectral Data","sourcePdf":"01717735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069922S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"36140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"36140","articleId":"1717735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":1717737,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This unprecedented time series of satellite imagery allows for extensive temporal observation of terrestrial processes such as land cover and land use change. However, despite this unique opportunity, most existing change detection techniques do not fully capitalize on this long time series. In this paper, a method that exploits both the temporal and spatial domains of time series satellite data to map land cover changes is presented. The time series of each pixel in the image is modeled with a combination of: 1) pixel-specific remotely sensed data; 2) neighboring pixels derived from ground observation data; and 3) time series transition probabilities. The spatial information is modeled with variograms and integrated using indicator kriging; time series transition probabilities are combined using an information-based cascade approach. This results in a map that is significantly more accurate in identifying when, where, and what land cover changes occurred. For the six images used in this paper, the prediction accuracy of the time series improves significantly, increasing from 31% to 61%, when both space and time are considered with the maximum likelihood. The consideration of spatial continuity also reduced unwanted speckles in the classified images, removing the need for any postprocessing. These results indicate that combining space and time domains significantly improves the accuracy of temporal change detection analyses and can produce high-quality time series land cover maps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9149312","volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/1717737/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Mapping Land Cover Changes: Incorporating Time and Space With Geostatistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Mapping Land Cover Changes: Incorporating Time and Space With Geostatistics","sourcePdf":"01717737.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069779S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"36140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"36140","articleId":"1717737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1717752,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

For nonconstant envelope input, the average efficiency is further increased by employing the envelope-tracking architecture using a wide-bandwidth high-efficiency envelope amplifier. The linearity of overall system is enhanced by digital pre-distortion. The measured average power-added efficiency of the amplifier is as high as 50.7% for a W-CDMA modulated signal with peak-to-average power ratio of 7.67 dB at an average output power of 37.2 W and gain of 10.0 dB.

In one-dimensional arrays, the constant inter-stage phase shift is varied by simultaneously detuning the two outermost oscillators in opposite directions. Thus, the array can be considered as a two-parameter system. Here, a two-parameter stability analysis of the oscillator array is carried out, investigating the phenomena that limit the achievable values of constant inter-stage phase shift under both weak and strong coupling conditions. The gradual evolution of the system behavior with increasing coupling strength is studied. A semianalytical approach is presented for an efficient design of the oscillator array, avoiding the computational expensiveness of harmonic balance (HB) in systems with a high number of oscillator elements. The proposed method, valid for weak coupling, uses a perturbation model of the elementary oscillator obtained with HB so it is of general application to any oscillator topology with accurate descriptions of its linear and nonlinear components. Approaches for the stability and phase-noise analyses based on this formulation are also presented. The new techniques have been applied to the design of a coupled system of three oscillators at 6 GHz. The results have been successfully compared with full HB simulations and with measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Phased arrays","Stability analysis","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Phase shifters","Coupling circuits","Feedback circuits","Topology","Phase noise","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled circuits","microwave oscillators","microwave phase shifters","phase noise","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamics","complex autonomous behavior","one-dimensional arrays","coupled-oscillator arrays","interstage phase shift","two-parameter system","harmonic balance","phase noise","stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bifurcation","coupled oscillator","phase noise","stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2006.884686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/36141/01717754.pdf","startPage":"3864","endPage":"3877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2006.884686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Techniques for the Analysis and Design of Coupled-Oscillator Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Techniques for the Analysis and Design of Coupled-Oscillator Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717754/","volume":"54","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1717754/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9159485","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Techniques for the Analysis and Design of Coupled-Oscillator Systems","sourcePdf":"01717754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117791S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"36141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"36141","articleId":"1717754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1717755,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In all these systems, user acceptability is strictly connected to several issues such as the residual abilities of the subject, the mechatronic characteristics of the robot, and also the interface chosen to link them. It is possible to figure out different \"human-interface-device\" combinations [also defined as \"hybrid bionic systems\" (HBSs)] characterized by different properties in terms of level of hybridness, connection, and augmentation. In particular, in HBSs the interface has to be customized according to the characteristics of the robotic artefact to be controlled and to the desires and needs of the final users. In this paper, our attention has been focused on the problem of the replacement of hand function after amputation. Three HBSs characterized by different levels of complexity, dexterity, and sensorization are presented in order to show the possibility of developing acceptable and effective systems by choosing different levels of connection and hybridness (i.e., different interfaces) for different devices and applications. The following case studies are presented: 1) the use of invasive interfaces to the peripheral nervous system to control a dexterous and highly sensorized hand prosthesis; 2) the use of electromyographic signals recorded using surface electrodes to control a compliant adaptive prosthesis; and 3) the use of a foot interface to control a two-degrees-of-freedom prosthesis. The preliminary results achieved so far seem to confirm the idea that the correct choice of the proper interface while developing an HBS can increase effectiveness and usability","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.881294","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/36142/01717792.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.881294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=36142","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Bionic Systems for the Replacement of Hand Function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1717792","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Bionic Systems for the Replacement of Hand Function","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1717792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 October 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"94","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9162108","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2006","htmlLink":"/document/1717792/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Bionic Systems for the Replacement of Hand Function","sourcePdf":"01717792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058306S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"36142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"36142","articleId":"1717792","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
