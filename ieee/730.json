From the equations describing the memristor model, the transfer characteristics of a memristor is formulated and analyzed. A first-order estimation of the cut-off frequency is shown, that illustrates the bandwidth limitation of the memristor and how it varies with some of its physical parameters. The design space is elaborated upon and it is shown that the state speed, the variation of the doped and undoped regions of the memristor, is inversely proportional to the physical length, and depth of the device. The transfer characteristics is simulated for Joglekar-Wolf, and Biolek window functions and the results are analyzed. The Joglekar-Wolf window function causes a distinct behavior in the tranfer characteristics at cut-off frequency. The Biolek window function on the other hand gives a smooth state transfer function, at the cost of loosing the one-to-one mapping between charge and state. We also elaborate on the design constraints derived from the transfer characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300037","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7287453/7299995/07300037.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Transfer characteristics and bandwidth limitation in a linear-drift memristor model","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524971","htmlLink":"/document/7300037/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer characteristics and bandwidth limitation in a linear-drift memristor model","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"paper129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079164S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7287453","isNumber":"7299995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7287453","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7299995","articleId":"7300037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300053,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Asghar Vatanjou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Ali Asghar","lastName":"Vatanjou","id":"37085397189"},{"name":"Trond Ytterdal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Trond","lastName":"Ytterdal","id":"37085496141"},{"name":"Snorre Aunet","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Snorre","lastName":"Aunet","id":"38558572600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9877-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9876-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300053","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Threshold voltage","CMOS integrated circuits","MOSFET","Layout","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS logic circuits","logic design","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","16-bit subthreshold adder","CMOS process","logic gates","logic circuit","reverse short channel effects","non-minimum gate lengths","failure probability","size 65 nm","voltage 119 mV to 350 mV"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300053","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7287453/7299995/07300053.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting short channel effects and multi-Vt technology for increased robustness and reduced energy consumption, with application to a 16-bit subthreshold adder implemented in 65 nm CMOS","abstract":"When using standard multi-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n CMOS processes when making logic gates, often for example Low-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n (LVT), or Standard-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n (SVT) or High-V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n (HVT) transistors are used within one and the same basic logic building block, like for example a NAND or NOR circuit.

Additionaly, Reverse Short Channel Effects (RSCE) are exploited by using non-minimum gate lengths for increased robustness agains process variations. Also, a recently proposed technique using very regular layouts accompanying the above mentioned techniques in a 16-bit adder implemented in 65 nm CMOS. Chip measurements using Sub-/Nearthreshold supply voltages demonstrate the functionality of the adder for a voltage range of 119 mV to 350 mV. Simulations show that by increasing gate lengths to 200 nm instead of the minimum 60 nm, may increase the footprint area of logic gates by only 12 %, while at the same time reducing probability of failure by up to several orders of magnitude. Simultaneously, energy per operation is reduced, when compared to conventional design methods using minimum, or relatively short, gate lengths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300053/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15525017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300053/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting short channel effects and multi-Vt technology for increased robustness and reduced energy consumption, with application to a 16-bit subthreshold adder implemented in 65 nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting short channel effects and multi-Vt technology for increased robustness and reduced energy consumption, with application to a 16-bit subthreshold adder implemented in 65 nm CMOS","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"paper147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048299S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7287453","isNumber":"7299995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7287453","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7299995","articleId":"7300053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300060,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Asad Alam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Syed Asad","lastName":"Alam","id":"37586133000"},{"name":"Oscar Gustafsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37270788100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9877-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9876-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300060","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Complexity theory","Systematics","Estimation","Monte Carlo methods","Noise","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory architecture","multiplying circuits","particle filtering (numerical methods)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory usage","double multipliers","resampling step","particle filters","compact memory structure","generalized division-free architecture"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300060","abstract":"The most challenging step of implementing particle filtering is the resampling step which replicates particles with large weights and discards those with small weights.

An 8-channel pipelined S/H ABF based on the SC analog memory following the SC-VGAs can improve the SNR to 54 dB and the HD2 to -54.3 dB. Each channel in the ABF consists of eight SC analog memories, and the total delay is up to 200 ns with the resolution of 25 ns.

In physics-based models of extended memristors under indirect excitation, the solution of the state equations is constrained to lie on specific manifolds at all times. A possible algorithm for the determination of numerical solutions to the algebraic differential equation set typical of these systems consists of augmenting the state vector with a novel variable which is invariant on the manifold. Solving the resulting ordinary differential equation problem simplifies the simulation since the algebraic constraint is embedded into the state equations. Regarding mathematical descriptions of generic memristors, where the state may only lie within a closed set, a procedure identifying each undesired event where the state either exceeds the upper bound or goes below the lower one, stopping the current simulation, starting a new one with initial condition set to the violated limit, and finally concatenating the time series of the various simulation sections, ensures a well-behaved simulation run, and, consequently, a reliable numerical solution. Examples from a number of case studies demonstrate that the adoption of the proposed techniques prevents possible issues emerging in classical numerical integration methodologies, resulting in well-behaved state solutions, thus allowing a meaningful exploration of the full potential of memristors in electronic circuit design.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300123","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7287453/7299995/07300123.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2015.7300123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques for reliable and accurate numerical solutions of memristor models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300123/","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for reliable and accurate numerical solutions of memristor models","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300123/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15525024","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for reliable and accurate numerical solutions of memristor models","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"paper9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059857S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7287453","isNumber":"7299995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7287453","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7299995","articleId":"7300123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300157,"authors":[{"name":"Senglee Foo","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Senglee","lastName":"Foo","id":"37085530250"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7809-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7808-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300157","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","MIMO","Antenna arrays","Couplings","Interference","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal-beam-space massive-MIMO array","low beam coupling factors","transmit beams"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates an alternative massive-MIMO array concept.

The module consists of two LTE antennas for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) method which requests low mutual coupling between the antennas for larger capacity. On the other hand, the installation location for a roof-top module is limited from safety or appearance viewpoint and this makes the multiple LTE antennas located there cannot be separated with enough space. In order to retain high isolation between the two antennas in such compact space, the two antennas are designed to have different shapes, different heights and different polarizations, and their ground planes are placed separately. In the proposed module, one antenna is a monopole type and has its element printed on a shark-fin-shaped substrate which is perpendicular to the car-roof. Another one is a planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) and has its element on a lower plane parallel to the roof. In this manner, the two antennas cover the LTE-bands with omni-directional radiation in the horizontal directions and high radiation gain. The two antennas have reasonably good isolation between them even the module is compact with a dimension of 62\u00d765\u00d773 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2015.7300160","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7288313/7300131/07300160.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2015.7300160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A roof automobile module for LTE-MIMO antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300160/","displayDocTitle":"A roof automobile module for LTE-MIMO antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15525105","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300160/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A roof automobile module for LTE-MIMO antennas","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039448S","chronDate":"7-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7288313","isNumber":"7300131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7288313","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7300131","articleId":"7300160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300173,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Relaying strategies are gaining increasing attention due also to the eventual deployment of small-cells in future generations wireless networks, where short-range communication is inherently to be favored, to cope with path-loss and to jointly improve energy-efficiency of the links. MIMO is naturally combined with relaying in order to further increase the overall spatial degrees of freedom of the system. Since the early introduction of relay-aided transmission protocols, in the field of information theory lot of efforts has been devoted to the analytical characterization of the performance of such strategies, with a main focus on dual-hop, single relay systems. This work moves a step toward the characterization of multilevel MIMO relay channels, where data transmission takes place through an arbitrary number of hops. We leverage tools and results from the physics of disordered systems, and put them into the framework of finite-sized multiple-antenna systems.","doi":"10.1109/APWC.2015.7300187","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE-APS Topical Conference on Antennas and Propagation in Wireless Communications (APWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7288313/7300131/07300187.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWC.2015.7300187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300131","startPage":"938","endPage":"941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic mutual information and its fluctuation in multi-level MIMO relay system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic mutual information and its fluctuation in multi-level MIMO relay system","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300187/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15525057","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300187/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic mutual information and its fluctuation in multi-level MIMO relay system","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091689S","chronDate":"7-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7288313","isNumber":"7300131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7288313","xplore-issue":"7300131","articleId":"7300187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300235,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh O.

Relays are used to help forward signals between a source and a destination. The AF relay amplifies the signal it receives then transmits it to the destination. Due to imperfect antenna isolation between the receiving and transmitting antennas at both ends of the relay, the transmitted signal will interfere with the relay's received signal. This will cause a SI problem. A solution is proposed in this paper to combat such a case by two tapped filter before the amplification stage. One of this filter's weights will be evaluated adaptively using the least mean squared (LMS) algorithm. The solution achieved does not require a priori knowledge of the SI channel weight. Simulation results are provided in this paper to verify the proposed methods performance.","doi":"10.1109/FGCT.2015.7300235","publicationTitle":"2015 Fourth International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technology (FGCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fourth International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technology (FGCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7275106/7300234/07300235.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCT.2015.7300235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay self-interference minimisation for QAM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300235/","displayDocTitle":"Relay self-interference minimisation for QAM signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15554053","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300235/","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay self-interference minimisation for QAM signals","confLoc":"Luton, UK","sourcePdf":"144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066219S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7275106","isNumber":"7300234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7275106","xplore-issue":"7300234","articleId":"7300235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300239,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Al-Shuraifi","affiliation":["Wireless and Network Communication Centre, WNCC Brunel University, London"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Al-Shuraifi","id":"37085354608"},{"name":"H.

Our simulation results shows that, for a given spectral efficiency , dramatic energy reduction can be achieved by this coordination scheme.","doi":"10.1109/FGCT.2015.7300240","publicationTitle":"2015 Fourth International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technology (FGCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Fourth International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technology (FGCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7275106/7300234/07300240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCT.2015.7300240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300234","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-spectral efficiency trade-off in coordinated multicell OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-spectral efficiency trade-off in coordinated multicell OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15554051","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-spectral efficiency trade-off in coordinated multicell OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Luton, UK","sourcePdf":"157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059104S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7275106","isNumber":"7300234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7275106","xplore-issue":"7300234","articleId":"7300240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300244,"authors":[{"name":"Martina Mironovova","affiliation":["Ceske Vysoke Uceni Technicke v Praze, Praha, CZ"],"firstName":"Martina","lastName":"Mironovova","id":"37085672539"},{"name":"Jir\u00ed B\u00edla","affiliation":["Department of Instrumentation and Control, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jir\u00ed","lastName":"B\u00edla","id":"37688812400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8267-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8266-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-2638"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-262X"}],"articleNumber":"7300244","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Neural networks","Databases","Heart rate variability","Heart beat"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","fast Fourier transforms","feature extraction","medical signal detection","neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform","feature extraction","neural network","electrocardiogram signal classification","heart abnormalities","electrocardiogram signal registration","signal filtering","R-peak detection","heart rate extraction","signal modelling","ECG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier Transform","Data Filtering","R-Peak Detection","Electrocardiogram Signal","Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300244","abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach to complex classification of heart abnormalities registered by electrocardiogram signals.

As a result, a larger variety of benchmarks might be needed to evade this problem and a measure of complexity established to determine the validity of all benchmarks.

The use of constraints in the conformation space accelerates the search by the genetic algorithm and improves its predictive capacity. The operators were tested in a crowding-based steady-state genetic algorithm implemented in the GAPF program, using a test set of eight proteins belonging to different classes (i.e., preferably \u03b1, \u03b1/\u03b2 and preferably \u03b2). The results show that using operators with restricted backbone dihedral angles ranges, for each amino acid and secondary structure type, reduces up to 75% the number of energy function evaluations required to obtain equivalent results to those obtained without the new operators. Furthermore, these new operators increased the capacity of the algorithm to obtain better protein models, since for the two largest proteins from the test set, i.e. 1BDD and 1GYZ, the best predicted models had their GDT-TS value increased by more than 10% comparing with those values obtained using the standard version of the algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295494/7300268/07300285.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic operators based on backbone constraint angles for protein structure prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Amino acids","Genetics","Computational modeling","Protocols","Genetic algorithms","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","genetics","molecular biophysics","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic operators","protein structure prediction","protein structure determination","conformation space","crowding-based steady-state genetic algorithm","GAPF program","restricted backbone dihedral angles ranges","amino acid","protein secondary structure","energy function evaluations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Genetic operators based on backbone constraint angles for protein structure prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15525203","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic operators based on backbone constraint angles for protein structure prediction","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"C15027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057967S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295494","isNumber":"7300268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295494","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7300268","articleId":"7300285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300294,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Shenfield","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Mathematics, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Shenfield","id":"38490803400"},{"name":"Shahin Rostami","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Mathematics, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Shahin","lastName":"Rostami","id":"38490791500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6926-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6925-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300294","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300294","abstract":"The optimisation of the accuracy of classifiers in pattern recognition is a complex problem that is often poorly understood. Whilst numerous techniques exist for the optimisation of weights in artificial neural networks (e.g. the Widrow-Hoff least mean squares algorithm and back propagation techniques), there do not exist any hard and fast rules for choosing the structure of an artificial neural network - in particular for choosing both the number of the hidden layers used in the network and the size (in terms of number of neurons) of those hidden layers. However, this internal structure is one of the key factors in determining the accuracy of the classification. This paper proposes taking a multi-objective approach to the evolutionary design of artificial neural networks using a powerful optimiser based around the state-of-the-art MOEA/D-DRA algorithm and a novel method of incorporating decision maker preferences. In contrast to previous approaches, the novel approach outlined in this paper allows the intuitive consideration of trade-offs between classification objectives that are frequently present in complex classification problems but are often ignored. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective approach to evolving artificial neural networks is then shown on a real-world medical classification problem frequently used to benchmark classification methods.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300294","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295494/7300268/07300294.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi objective approach to evolving artificial neural networks for coronary heart disease classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Biological neural networks","Heart","Diseases","Sociology","Statistics","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","diseases","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective approach","artificial neural networks","coronary heart disease classification","pattern recognition","Widrow-Hoff least mean squares algorithm","back propagation techniques","neurons","evolutionary design","MOEA-D-DRA algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A multi objective approach to evolving artificial neural networks for coronary heart disease classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300294/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15525204","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi objective approach to evolving artificial neural networks for coronary heart disease classification","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"C15040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066286S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295494","isNumber":"7300268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295494","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7300268","articleId":"7300294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300299,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin McDonough","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"McDonough","id":"37887676300"},{"name":"Ilya Kolmanovsky","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Kolmanovsky","id":"37301329200"},{"name":"Inna V.

One particularly relevant field of research is multimodal registration, where data sets must be aligned in order to make their structures overlay. The overlay of the image positions is reached by optimizing a similarity metric. A commonly used measure applied in this process is the normalized mutual information, which also will be used in this paper. Due to iteratively improving this function value, a transformation can be determined, which adapts the data in order to make the images overlap each other as accurately as possible. For this improvement process, different mathematical optimization methods are in use. One approach is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a nature-inspired optimization technique. In the present work, four variants of the PSO algorithm are presented and applied to medical image data. Although classical PSO with standard parameters is shown to have some limitations, considerable improvement can be obtained by the modification of the calculation rules, the choice of the parameter values and the choice of the objective function. Our experimental results illustrate the substantial potential of PSO for this type of application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15525249","htmlLink":"/document/7300314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multimodal medical image registration using particle swarm optimization with influence of the data's initial orientation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal medical image registration using particle swarm optimization with influence of the data's initial orientation","confLoc":"Niagara Falls, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"C15071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087491S","chronDate":"12-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295494","isNumber":"7300268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295494","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7300268","articleId":"7300314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300382,"authors":[{"name":"Ahsan Adeel","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Lanarkshire, U.K."],"firstName":"Ahsan","lastName":"Adeel","id":"37085357176"},{"name":"Hadi Larijani","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Lanarkshire, U.K."],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Larijani","id":"37660795600"},{"name":"Ali Ahmadinia","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Lanarkshire, U.K."],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ahmadinia","id":"37265198500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2169-3536"}],"articleNumber":"7300382","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1843},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/index.html"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"An overview of the proposed radio resource management and inter-cell interference coordination framework based on Random Neural Networks.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"43KB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7300382/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2489865.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7300382/graphical_abstract/access-gagraphic-2489865.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Intercell interference","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","genetic algorithms","Long Term Evolution","neural nets","OFDM modulation","power control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource management","inter-cell-interference coordination","LTE uplink system","random neural network","orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems","inter-cell interference","resource blocks","power control strategy","genetic algorithm-based hybrid cognitive engine architecture","capacity optimization","long-term evolution uplink system","eNodeB","local environment","optimal transmission power","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","transmission time intervals","transmit power","communication interface","long-term learning","fast decision making","computational complexity","real-time cognitive communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural network","coverage and capacity optimization","fractional power control","genetic algorithm","Intercell interference","power control","random neural network"]},{"kwd":["Artificial neural network","coverage and capacity optimization","fractional power control","genetic algorithm","inter-cell interference","power control","random neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300382","abstract":"In orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems, inter-cell interference (ICI) can be considered as a collision between resource blocks (RBs), which can be reduced by employing a power control strategy at colliding RBs. This paper presents a random neural network (RNN) and a genetic algorithm-based hybrid cognitive engine (CE) architecture to reduce the ICI and achieve the coverage and capacity optimization in a long-term evolution uplink system. The embedded CE within eNodeB learns from the local environment about the effect of ICI on the reliability of communications. Consequently, the CE dynamically selects the optimal transmission power for serving users based on an experienced signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and an ICI on a scheduled RB in the subsequent transmission time intervals. The CE also suggests acceptable transmit power to users operating on the same scheduled RB in adjacent cells through the X2 interface (a communication interface between eNodeBs). The RNN features help the CE to acquire long-term learning, fast decision making, and less computational complexity, which are essential for the development and practical deployment of any real-time cognitive communication system. In six different test cases, the simulation results have shown improvements up to 87% in long-term learning and a quick convergence of the RNN as compared with artificial neural network models. Moreover, the gains of 7% in average cell capacity and 118% in system coverage have been achieved as compared with a fractional power control method.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2489865","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2489865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07300382.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Management and Inter-Cell-Interference Coordination in LTE Uplink System Using Random Neural Network and Optimization","topic":"Artificial Intelligence Enabled Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300382/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resource Management and Inter-Cell-Interference Coordination in LTE Uplink System Using Random Neural Network and Optimization","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7300382/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15543322","publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Resource Management and Inter-Cell-Interference Coordination in LTE Uplink System Using Random Neural Network and Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-larijani-2489865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04887S","chronDate":"2015","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","topics":["Artificial Intelligence Enabled Networking"],"articleId":"7300382","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7300383,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Isautier","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Isautier","id":"37062139400"},{"name":"Jie Pan","affiliation":["ADVA Optical Networking, Norcross, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Pan","id":"37595814500"},{"name":"Richard DeSalvo","affiliation":["Harris Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"DeSalvo","id":"37332127300"},{"name":"Stephen E.

However, the interference among dense small-cells exacerbates in hyper dense deployment coupled with incessant use of multimedia services. In this paper, a network-side self-organized coalition formation approach for intra-tier interference mitigation primarily through neighborhood cooperation is proposed. By forming disjoint coalitions, small-cell access points (SAPs) are able to mitigate the interference within a coalition and thus improve their achievable data rates. The cooperative behavior among the neighborhood SAPs is formulated as a coalition formation game in partition form with non-transferable utility. Instead of fully reversible and irreversible methods used in prior studies, a merge and split based algorithm with partial reversibility rule which can obtain a final stable partition in the recursive core is proposed. The proposed algorithm converges to a final stable partition in a finite number of steps and works efficiently for both co-channel and orthogonal radio resource allocation modes. Simulation results have verified that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the individual SAP throughput for both modes when compared with the conventional and the non-cooperative schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8323440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2487604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8323440/07300385.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"615","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2487604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous Small-Cell Networks: A Coalition Formation Game Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous Small-Cell Networks: A Coalition Formation Game Approach","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7300385/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17649962","dateOfInsertion":"23 March 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222103 and 61361166005"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Coordination in Heterogeneous Small-Cell Networks: A Coalition Formation Game Approach","sourcePdf":"jsyst-peng-2487604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087245S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8323440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8323440","articleId":"7300385","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7300391,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk-Jan van den Broek","affiliation":["IC Design Group, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7300391/vande-2482495-small.gif","p":["Dirk-Jan van den Broek (S\u201914) was born in Roosendaal, The Netherlands, in 1986.

This paper proposes a receiver in which a copy of the transmit signal is fed through a switched-resistor vector modulator (VM) that provides simultaneous downmixing, phase shift, and amplitude scaling and subtracts it in the analog baseband for up to 27 dB SI-cancellation. Cancelling before active baseband amplification avoids self-blocking, and highly linear mixers keep SI-induced distortion low, for a receiver SI-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SINDR) of up to 71.5 dB in 16.25 MHz BW. When combined with a two-port antenna with only 20 dB isolation, the low RX distortion theoretically allows sufficient digital cancellation for over 90 dB link budget, sufficient for short-range, low-power FD links.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"50","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15618351","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300391/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An In-Band Full-Duplex Radio Receiver With a Passive Vector Modulator Downmixer for Self-Interference Cancellation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"316369"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An In-Band Full-Duplex Radio Receiver With a Passive Vector Modulator Downmixer for Self-Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"jssc-broek-2482495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058775S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7336577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7336577","articleId":"7300391","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7300392,"authors":[{"name":"Heng-Chao Li","affiliation":["Sichuan Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Heng-Chao","lastName":"Li","id":"37407168800"},{"name":"Turgay Celik","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Turgay","lastName":"Celik","id":"37304384200"},{"name":"Nathan Longbotham","affiliation":["DigitalGlobe, Inc., Longmont, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Longbotham","id":"38071534800"},{"name":"William J.

This approach jointly exploits the robust Gabor wavelet representation and the advanced cascade clustering. First, a log-ratio image is generated from the multitemporal images. Then, to integrate contextual information in the feature extraction process, Gabor wavelets are employed to yield the representation of the log-ratio image at multiple scales and orientations, whose maximum magnitude over all orientations in each scale is concatenated to form the Gabor feature vector. Next, a cascade clustering algorithm is designed in this discriminative feature space by successively combining the first-level fuzzy c-means clustering with the second-level nearest neighbor rule. Finally, the two-level combination of the changed and unchanged results generates the final change map. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2015.2484220","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7327291/07300392.pdf","startPage":"2458","endPage":"2462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2015.2484220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gabor Feature Based Unsupervised Change Detection of Multitemporal SAR Images Based on Two-Level Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300392/","displayDocTitle":"Gabor Feature Based Unsupervised Change Detection of Multitemporal SAR Images Based on Two-Level Clustering","volume":"12","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587694","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300392/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371165"},{"fundingName":"Chengdu Science and Technology Bureau project","grantNumber":"2014-HM01-00279-SF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0711"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gabor Feature Based Unsupervised Change Detection of Multitemporal SAR Images Based on Two-Level Clustering","sourcePdf":"lgrs-li-2484220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082699S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7327291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7327291","articleId":"7300392","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7300399,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An accelerated processor is chosen based on task-specific priorities (power consumption, processing time, and detection accuracy), and this decision is normally made once at design time. All three of the characteristics are important, particularly in battery-powered systems. Here, we propose a method for moving selection of processing platform from a single design-time choice to a continuous run-time one. We implement Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for cars and people and Mixture-of-Gaussians motion detectors running across FPGA, GPU, and central processing unit in a heterogeneous system. We use this to detect illegally parked vehicles in urban scenes. Power, time, and accuracy information for each detector is characterized. An anomaly measure is assigned to each detected object based on its trajectory and location compared with learned contextual movement patterns. This drives processor and implementation selection so that scenes with high behavioral anomalies are processed with faster but more power-hungry implementations, but routine or static time periods are processed with power-optimized and less accurate slower versions. Real-time performance is evaluated on video data sets including i-LIDS. Compared with power-optimized static selection, automatic dynamic implementation mapping is 10% more accurate, but draws 12-W of extra power in our testbed desktop system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Anomaly Detection in Real Time on a Power-Aware Heterogeneous Platform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2492838","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7723941/07300407.pdf","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2492838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Video Anomaly Detection in Real Time on a Power-Aware Heterogeneous Platform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7300407/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16425704","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Thales Optronics"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J015180/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009941","fundingName":"Ministry of Defence University Defence Research Collaboration in Signal Processing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Video Anomaly Detection in Real Time on a Power-Aware Heterogeneous Platform","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-blair-2492838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088741S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7723941","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7723941","articleId":"7300407","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7300410,"authors":[{"name":"Dongshuai Li","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, CMA Key Laboratory for Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/7407432/7300410/li-small.gif","p":["Dongshuai Li was born in Inner Mongolia, China, in 1987.

The analysis is supported by experimental observations consisting of simultaneous records of lightning currents and electric fields associated with upward negative lightning flashes to the instrumented S\u00e4ntis tower in Switzerland. The propagation of lightning electromagnetic fields along the mountainous region around the S\u00e4ntis tower is simulated using a full-wave approach based on the finite-difference time-domain method and using the two-dimensional topographic map along the direct path between the tower and the field measurement station located at about 15 km from the tower. We show that, considering the real irregular terrain between the S\u00e4ntis tower and the field measurement station, both the waveshape and amplitude of the simulated electric fields associated with return strokes and fast initial continuous current pulses are in excellent agreement with the measured waveforms. On the other hand, the assumption of a flat ground results in a significant underestimation of the peak electric field. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of the obtained results to the assumed values for the return stroke speed and the ground conductivity, the adopted return stroke model, as well as the presence of the building on which the sensors were located.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Lightning Electromagnetic Field Propagation Along an Irregular Terrain","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2015.2483018","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/7407432/07300410.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2015.2483018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7407432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"On Lightning Electromagnetic Field Propagation Along an Irregular Terrain","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7300410/","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"200021_147058"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB441405"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41275009 and 41375037"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Lightning Electromagnetic Field Propagation Along an Irregular Terrain","sourcePdf":"temc-li-2483018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125449S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"7407432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7407432","articleId":"7300410","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7300413,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Machine Perception, and the Department of Machine Intelligence, Peking University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7300413/hu-2487318-small.gif","p":["Weiwei Hu received the Bachelor of Science degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2012.

Prototype generation is a widely used approach to reduce the classification time, which generates a small set of prototypes to classify a test instance instead of using the whole training set. In this paper, particle swarm optimization is applied to prototype generation and two novel methods for improving the classification performance are presented: 1) a fitness function named error rank and 2) the multiobjective (MO) optimization strategy. Error rank is proposed to enhance the generation ability of the NN classifier, which takes the ranks of misclassified instances into consideration when designing the fitness function. The MO optimization strategy pursues the performance on multiple subsets of data simultaneously, in order to keep the classifier from overfitting the training set. Experimental results over 31 UCI data sets and 59 additional data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms nearly 30 existing prototype generation algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16465636","pubMedId":"26513820","htmlLink":"/document/7300413/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prototype Generation Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization for Nearest Neighbor Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61375119, 61170057 and 60875080"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Development Plan (973 Plan) Project of China","grantNumber":"2015CB352302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prototype Generation Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization for Nearest Neighbor Classification","sourcePdf":"tcyb-hu-2487318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11818S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7744634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7744634","articleId":"7300413","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7300423,"authors":[{"name":"Yujun Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, South University of Science and Technology of China, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7300423/shi-2492940-small.gif","p":["\n\nYujun Shi (M'15) received the B.Sc. degree from Hubei Polytechnic \nUniversity, Huangshi, China, in 2010 and the M.Sc. degree from Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China, in 2013.","From 2013 to 2014, he was a Research Assistant in the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of \nSciences, Shenzhen, China.

In previous studies, the approach for analyzing FSPM machines is either by using the lumped parameter magnetic circuit models or from the \u201cgenerator-oriented\u201d perspective. In this paper, the operating principle of FSPM machines is reiterated from a new perspective, viz., the \u201cmotor-oriented\u201d perspective. Some interesting findings and essential principles can be unveiled, which include how the stable electromagnetic torque can be developed, how the pole-pair number (PPN) of armature windings, the PPN of PMs, and the synchronous speed of the armature field should be defined, and how to determine the connection of coils for the sake of developing stable electromagnetic torques. This new perspective is more consistent with the classical theory on electric machines. There is no need to consider the polarity of coils when determining the connection of windings. Three typical FSPM machines with different combinations of stator and rotor poles, viz., 12/11-pole, 12/13-pole, and 12/26-pole, are investigated to verify the validity of the proposed analysis approach. Experimental verification concerning the latter two sample machines is also conducted.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2492940","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07300423.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1437","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2492940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Perspective on the Operating Principle of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A New Perspective on the Operating Principle of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Machines","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15775331","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7300423/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51377158"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China","grantNumber":"2014A030306034"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Innovation Committee of Shenzhen, China","grantNumber":"KQCX20140522151322948"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Perspective on the Operating Principle of Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-jian-2492940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073782S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7300423","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7300428,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaping Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7398215/7300428/zhao-2492558-small.gif","p":["Jiaping Zhao received the bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees\n from Wuhan University in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

Here, we adopt the bag-of-words (BoW) framework to classify time series. Our algorithm first samples local subsequences from time series at feature-point locations when available. It then builds local descriptors, and models their distribution by Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and at last it computes a Fisher Vector (FV) to encode each time series. The encoded FV representations of time series are readily used by existing classifiers, e.g., SVM, for training and prediction. In our work, we focus on detecting better feature points and crafting better local representations, while using existing techniques to learn codebook and encode time series. Specifically, we develop an efficient and effective peak and valley detection algorithm from real-case time series data. Subsequences are sampled from these peaks and valleys, instead of sampled randomly or uniformly as was done previously. Then, two local descriptors, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG-1D) and Dynamic time warping-Multidimensional scaling (DTW-MDS), are designed to represent sampled subsequences. Both descriptors complement each other, and their fused representation is shown to be more descriptive than individual ones. We test our approach extensively on 43 UCR time series datasets, and obtain significantly improved classification accuracies over existing approaches, including NNDTW and shapelet transform.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/69/7398215/7300428-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300428/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2016","publicationDate":"1 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15755232","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Classifying Time Series Using Local Descriptors with Hybrid Sampling","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1317433"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-13-1-0563"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-11-1-0046 and W911NF-12-1-0433"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Classifying Time Series Using Local Descriptors with Hybrid Sampling","sourcePdf":"tkde-zhao-2492558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126057S","chronDate":"March 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7398215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7398215","articleId":"7300428","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":7300429,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim MolavianJazi","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ebrahim MolavianJazi (S\u201908\u2013M\u201914) is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory (WCAN) of The Pennsylvania State University.

However, we conduct the analysis through a convenient yet powerful form of the CLT, called the CLT for functions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Dispersion","Random variables","Channel coding","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Gaussian channels","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second order achievable rate region","Gaussian multiaccess channels","central limit theorem","multiaccess networks","stringent delay constraints","MAC","finite blocklength","CLT approximations","nonasymptotic information spectrum inner bounds","Gaussian MAC","positive average error probability","percodeword power constraints","information random variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random coding and threshold decoding","mutual information random variable","power shell input","change of measure","delta method","dispersion matrix","second-order coding rate","non-asymptotic achievability bounds","low-latency communications"]},{"kwd":["Random coding and threshold decoding","mutual information random variable","power shell input","change of measure","delta method","dispersion matrix","second-order coding rate","non-asymptotic achievability bounds","low-latency communications"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2492547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7331248/07300429.pdf","startPage":"6719","endPage":"6733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2492547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Second-Order Achievable Rate Region for Gaussian Multi-Access Channels via a Central Limit Theorem for Functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300429","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7331248/7300429-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Second-Order Achievable Rate Region for Gaussian Multi-Access Channels via a Central Limit Theorem for Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300429/","volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300429/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15601953","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF05-46618 and CPS12-39222"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A Second-Order Achievable Rate Region for Gaussian Multi-Access Channels via a Central Limit Theorem for Functions","sourcePdf":"tit-molavianjazi-2492547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11034S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7331248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7331248","articleId":"7300429","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7300430,"authors":[{"name":"Xudong Wang","affiliation":["UM-SJTU Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7530934/7300430/wang-2492544-small.gif","p":["Xudong Wang received the PhD degree in electrical and computer\n engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in August 2003.

However, in a large scale wireless network such as a wireless mesh network, the capacity gain from full duplex communications has not been fully investigated. To this end, a metric of network capacity called transmission capacity is studied in this paper for a full duplex wireless network. It captures the maximum transmission throughput in a unit area, subject to a certain outage probability. The key challenge of deriving transmission capacity is to characterize the aggregate interference of the typical link in a full duplex wireless network, which is completely different from that in a half duplex wireless network. In this paper, stochastic geometry is employed to model the network topology as a Thomas cluster point process and then the aggregate interference is characterized as a shot-noise process. Based on these models, the transmission capacity is derived. Analytical results show that under the same network density the distribution of aggregate interference in a full duplex wireless network is more dispersed than that in a half duplex wireless network. Comparisons of transmission capacity between a full duplex network and a half duplex network reveal that the capacity gain from full duplex communications is limited due to severe aggregate interference. This result implies that self-interference cancellation alone cannot ensure scalable full duplex wireless networking.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300430/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191274","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity Gain from Full Duplex Communications in a Large Scale Wireless Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ZTE Cooperation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity Gain from Full Duplex Communications in a Large Scale Wireless Network","sourcePdf":"tmc-wang-2492544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093444S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7530934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7530934","articleId":"7300430","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7300431,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Dagbagi","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Syst\u00e8mes Electriques (LR11ES15), \u00c9cole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Universit\u00e9 de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7300431/dagba-2491883-small.gif","p":["\n\nMohamed Dagbagi received the B.S. degree in industrial computing from \nthe Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Informatique de Tunis (ISI), Tunis, Tunisia, in 2008 and the M.S. degree in electrical \nengineering from the \u00c9cole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis (ENIT), Universit\u00e9 de Tunis El Manar, \nTunis, in 2010.

Indeed, such simulators' intellectual properties (IPs) are not only intended for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing but also can be advantageously embedded within digital controllers to ensure functions such as observation, estimation, diagnostic, or health monitoring. Conversely, to the HIL case, the main challenge when designing such simulators' IPs is to cope with their complexity having in mind that, in the case of embedded systems, the available hardware resources are limited due to the cost. Furthermore, this challenge is strengthened by the need of very short simulation time steps that is typically the case when simulating power converters. By this way, this paper presents the design of an embedded RT simulator of a three-phase grid-connected voltage-source rectifier, based on the associated discrete circuit modeling approach. This IP is associated with the one of a three-phase RL filter, and both are implemented within the rectifier controller to estimate the grid currents. The latter is injected in the controller when a fault is detected in the current sensors. The ability of this estimator to guarantee the service continuity in case of faults has been validated through HIL tests and experiments.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07300431.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ADC-Based Embedded Real-Time Simulator of a Power Converter Implemented in a Low-Cost FPGA: Application to a Fault-Tolerant Control of a Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Rectifier","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2491883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2491883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"ADC-Based Embedded Real-Time Simulator of a Power Converter Implemented in a Low-Cost FPGA: Application to a Fault-Tolerant Control of a Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Rectifier","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697120","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7300431/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Tunisian Ministry of High Education and Research","grantNumber":"LR-LSE-ENIT-LR11ES15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADC-Based Embedded Real-Time Simulator of a Power Converter Implemented in a Low-Cost FPGA: Application to a Fault-Tolerant Control of a Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Rectifier","sourcePdf":"tie-dagbagi-2491883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106232S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7300431","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7300436,"authors":[{"name":"Manjesh K.

Frequency hopping (FH) and transmission rate adaptation (RA) have been separately used to mitigate jamming. When RA is used alone, it has been shown that a jammer who randomizes its power levels can force the transmitter to always operate at the lowest rate, by maintaining the average jamming power above a certain threshold. On the other hand, when only FH is used, a high throughput overhead is incurred due to frequent channel switching. In this paper, we propose to mitigate jamming by jointly optimizing the FH and RA techniques. This way, the transmitter can escape the jammer by changing its channel, adjusting its rate, or both. We consider a power-constrained \u201creactive-sweep\u201d jammer who aims at degrading the throughput of the wireless link. The jammer sweeps through the set of channels, jamming a subset of them at a time, using the optimal jamming power. We model the interactions between the legitimate transmitter and jammer as a constrained zero-sum Markov game. The transmitter's optimal defense strategy is derived by obtaining the equilibria of the constrained Markov game. This policy informs the transmitter when to hop to another channel and when to stay on the current channel. Furthermore, it gives the best transmission rate to use in both cases (hop or stay). The structure of the transmitter's optimal policy is shown to be threshold type, whereby the transmitter stays on the same channel up to a certain number of time slots after which it hops. We analyze the \u201cconstrained Nash equilibrium\u201d of the Markov game and show that the equilibrium defense strategy of the transmitter is deterministic. Numerical investigations show that the new scheme improves the average throughput and provides better jamming resiliency.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2492556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530934","startPage":"2247","endPage":"2259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7530934/07300436.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Adaptation of Frequency Hopping and Transmission Rate for Anti-Jamming Wireless Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300436/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Adaptation of Frequency Hopping and Transmission Rate for Anti-Jamming Wireless Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191276","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIP-1265960, IIP-1432880 and CNS-1409172"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-13-1-0302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Adaptation of Frequency Hopping and Transmission Rate for Anti-Jamming Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"tmc-abdelrahman-2492556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099313S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7530934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7530934","articleId":"7300436","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7300440,"authors":[{"name":"Su-Dan Huang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Control, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7300440/huang-2492948-small.gif","p":["\n\nSu-Dan Huang received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in control theory and \ncontrol engineering from Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

To date, no metric has been proposed for underwater color image quality evaluation (UCIQE). The special absorption and scattering characteristics of the water medium do not allow direct application of natural color image quality metrics especially to different underwater environments. In this paper, subjective testing for underwater image quality has been organized. The statistical distribution of the underwater image pixels in the CIELab color space related to subjective evaluation indicates the sharpness and colorful factors correlate well with subjective image quality perception. Based on these, a new UCIQE metric, which is a linear combination of chroma, saturation, and contrast, is proposed to quantify the non-uniform color cast, blurring, and low-contrast that characterize underwater engineering and monitoring images. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed UCIQE metric and its capability to measure the underwater image enhancement results. They show that the proposed metric has comparable performance to the leading natural color image quality metrics and the underwater grayscale image quality metrics available in the literature, and can predict with higher accuracy the relative amount of degradation with similar image content in underwater environments. Importantly, UCIQE is a simple and fast solution for real-time underwater video processing. The effectiveness of the presented measure is also demonstrated by subjective evaluation. The results show better correlation between the UCIQE and the subjective mean opinion score.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2491020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2491020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07300447.pdf","startPage":"6062","endPage":"6071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation Metric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation Metric","volume":"24","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300447/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15644027","pubMedId":"26513783","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300447/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China","grantNumber":"12KJB170001"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Fund through the Foundation Research Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140445"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation Metric","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2491020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093202S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7300447","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7300448,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7530934/7300448/lu-2492545-small.gif","p":["Zhuo Lu received the PhD degree from the Department of Electrical and\n Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, in 2013.

Different from Internet botnets, mobile botnets do not need to propagate using centralized infrastructures, but can keep compromising vulnerable nodes in close proximity and evolving organically via data forwarding. Such a distributed mechanism relies heavily on node mobility as well as wireless links, therefore it breaks down the underlying premise in existing epidemic modeling for Internet botnets. In this paper, we adopt a stochastic approach to study the evolution and impact of mobile botnets. We find that node mobility can be a trigger to botnet propagation storms: the average size (i.e., number of compromised nodes) of a botnet increases quadratically over time if the mobility range that each node can reach exceeds a threshold; otherwise, the botnet can only contaminate a limited number of nodes with average size always bounded above. This also reveals that mobile botnets can propagate at the fastest rate of quadratic growth in size, which is substantially slower than the exponential growth of Internet botnets. To measure the denial-of-service impact of a mobile botnet, we define a new metric, called last chipper time, which is the last time that service requests, even partially, can still be processed on time as the botnet keeps propagating and launching attacks. The last chipper time is identified to decrease at most on the order of 1=\u221aB, where B is the network bandwidth. This result reveals that although increasing network bandwidth can help mobile services, it can, at the same time, indeed escalate the risk of services being disrupted by mobile botnets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Evolution and Impact of Mobile Botnets in Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2492545","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7530934/07300448.pdf","startPage":"2304","endPage":"2316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2492545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7530934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the Evolution and Impact of Mobile Botnets in Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7300448/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191278","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-142315 and CNS-1018447"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Evolution and Impact of Mobile Botnets in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-lu-2492545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090083S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7530934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7530934","articleId":"7300448","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7300453,"authors":[{"name":"Eoghan O'Riordan","affiliation":["University College Dublin, School of Electrical, Electronic and Communications Engineering, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7307240/7300453/7300453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eoghan O\u2019Riordan received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland, in 2012.

However, many questions remain concerning their key architecture parameters and efficiency, as the signal count between dice is reduced and the delay between the dice is increased compared with a monolithic FPGA. We modify the versatile place and route (VPR) to target interposer-based FPGAs and investigate placement and routing changes and incorporating partitioning into the flow to improve results. Our best computer-aided design (CAD) flow reduces the routing demand for interposer FPGAs with realistic connectivity between dice by 47% and improves the circuit speed by 13% on average. Architecture modifications to add routing flexibility when crossing the interposer are very beneficial and improve routability by a further 11%. With these CAD and architecture enhancements, we find that if an interposer supplies (between dice) 20% of the routing capacity that the normal (within-die) FPGA routing channels supply, there is only a modest impact on circuit routability. Smaller interposer-routing capacities do impact routability; however, minimum channel width increases by 70% when an interposer supplies only 10% of the within-die routing. The interposer also impacts delay, increasing circuit delay by 11% on average for a 1-ns interposer signal delay and a two-die system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935079","htmlLink":"/document/7300463/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple Dice Working as One: CAD Flows and Routing Architectures for Silicon Interposer FPGAs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Brazil\u2019s Ci\u00eancia sem Fronteiras Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada/Altera Industrial Research Chair in Programmable Silicon"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Dice Working as One: CAD Flows and Routing Architectures for Silicon Interposer FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-betz-2478280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077726S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7456352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7456352","articleId":"7300463","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7300466,"authors":[{"name":"Xianmin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7456352/7300466/chen-2483525-small.gif","p":["Xianmin Chen received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2010.

This problem, known as the utilization wall or dark silicon, is becoming increasingly serious. With the introduction of 3-D integrated circuits (ICs), it is likely to become more severe. Thus, how to take advantage of the extra transistors, made available by Moore's law and the onset of 3-D ICs, within the power budget poses a significant challenge to system designers. To address this challenge, we propose a 3-D hybrid architecture consisting of a CPU layer with multiple cores, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) layer, and a DRAM layer. The architecture is designed for low power without sacrificing performance. The FPGA layer is capable of supporting a large number of accelerators. It is placed adjacent to the CPU layer, with a communication mechanism that allows it to access CPU data caches directly. This enables fast switches between these two layers. This architecture reduces the power and energy significantly, at better or similar performance. This then alleviates the dark silicon problem by letting us power ON more components to achieve higher performance. We evaluate the proposed architecture through a new framework we have developed. Relative to the out-of-order CPU, the accelerators on the FPGA layer can reduce function-level power by 6.9\u00d7 and energy-delay product (EDP) by 7.2\u00d7, and application-level power by 1.9\u00d7 and EDP by 2.2\u00d7, while delivering similar performance. For the entire system, this translates to a 47.5% power reduction relative to a baseline system that consists of a CPU layer and a DRAM layer. This also translates to a 72.9% power reduction relative to an alternative system that consists of a CPU layer, an L3 cache layer, and a DRAM layer.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2483525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2483525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7456352/07300466.pdf","startPage":"1649","endPage":"1662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3-D CPU-FPGA-DRAM Hybrid Architecture for Low-Power Computation","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/7456352/7300466-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A 3-D CPU-FPGA-DRAM Hybrid Architecture for Low-Power Computation","volume":"24","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300466/","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935059","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300466/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1216457"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"A 3-D CPU-FPGA-DRAM Hybrid Architecture for Low-Power Computation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chen-2483525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090157S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7456352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7456352","articleId":"7300466","onlineDate":"19 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7300558,"authors":[{"name":"Biswajit Biswas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Biswajit","lastName":"Biswas","id":"38241951600"},{"name":"Ritamshirsa Choudhuri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Ritamshirsa","lastName":"Choudhuri","id":"37085711139"},{"name":"Kashi Nath Dey","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Kashi Nath","lastName":"Dey","id":"38111991200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1812-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1811-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"7300558","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"abstract":"In this paper a non-sub-sampled shearlet transform model for image enhancement to improve image quality by maximizing the information content in the input image is proposed and implemented. This is inspired by two basic human visual features: i) visual adaptation, ii) local contrast enhancement of color image. We achieve the goal in different stages: In initial stage evolved upon the shearlet transformation of an image from image space to a low-pass and high-pass images in shearlet space and then to the visual response space. The visual adaptation is generally implemented with the Naka-Rushton equation, a rational transformation which allows to accurately compress the range of the input image. The later stage consists in a variational method able to perform local contrast enhancement with Weber-Fechner's law. After modifying the response values, the transformation can be reversed to produce the resulting image. The proposed method Naka-Rushton shearlet Image Enhancement (NRSIE) has been implemented on several color images. The results are compared with two other popular color image enhancement techniques along with visual analysis, detail and background variance. It has been found that NRSIE scales better results compared to two other popular methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Image color

If the target is moving relative to the radar, an additional phase shift is introduced into the baseband signal because of the Doppler effect. Hence the Doppler frequency has to be estimated in addition to the DOA. In general, this decreases the DOA estimation accuracy. We investigate MIMO radars using time division multiplexing (TDM). We derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for a moving target and a general TDM scheme and compare it to other radar systems. Moreover we derive optimal TDM schemes which minimize the CRB under different constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7277353/7300553/07300572.pdf","startPage":"000108","endPage":"000113","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2014.7300572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2014.7300572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal time division multiplexing schemes for DOA estimation of a moving target using a colocated MIMO radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiplexing","Radar antennas","Transmitting antennas","Direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colocated MIMO radar","optimal time division multiplexing scheme","DOA estimation","moving target","multiple-input-multiple-output radar","direction of arrival estimation","single-input-multiple-output radar","Doppler effect","Cramer-Rao bound","CRB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","DOA estimation","Time Division Multiplexing","Cramer Rao Bound","CRB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal time division multiplexing schemes for DOA estimation of a moving target using a colocated MIMO radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15554066","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal time division multiplexing schemes for DOA estimation of a moving target using a colocated MIMO radar","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"isspit2014submission159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045351S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7277353","isNumber":"7300553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7277353","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7300553","articleId":"7300572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300574,"authors":[{"name":"Sobhan Kanti Dhara","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sobhan Kanti","lastName":"Dhara","id":"37085371582"},{"name":"Deepak Singh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085389322"},{"name":"Sukadev Meher","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sukadev","lastName":"Meher","id":"37975380300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1812-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1811-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7843"}],"articleNumber":"7300574","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diamonds","Optimization","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","image matching","motion compensation","motion estimation","particle swarm optimisation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid particle swarm optimization technique","video compression","video coding","block matching based motion compensation techniques","motion estimation algorithm","block matching based particle swarm optimization technique","temporal correlation","spatial correlation","particle population","particle location history preservation","particle location history exploitation","structural similarity index","SSIM","peak signal to noise ratio","PSNR","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matching","motion estimation","particle swarm optimization(PSO)","personal best(pbest)","global best(gbest)"]}],"abstract":"Fast and accurate motion compensation is a crucial task in all standard of video coding.

While the stability of self-triggered controllers is often addressed, their capacity to actually reduce the cost is more difficult to be evaluated. Inspired by a recent result on the optimal density of the sampling instants that minimizes the control cost, in this paper we propose a new self-triggered control strategy. The proposed sampling rule is extremely simple and effective. Significant cost reductions compared to the optimal periodic controller are shown even with larger minimum intersample separation. Thanks to the simplicity of the sampling rule, we also implemented the proposed self-triggered controller over a physical plant. The experimental results are aligned with the theoretical ones.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Approximation methods","Aerospace electronics","Sampling methods","MIMICs","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","optimal control","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal-sampling-inspired self-triggered control","control performance","self-triggered controller stability","optimal density","sampling instants","control cost minimization","sampling rule","minimum intersample separation","sampling rule","physical plant"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300648","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300648.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal-sampling-inspired Self-Triggered control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal-sampling-inspired Self-Triggered control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300648/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300648/","accessionNumber":"15553987","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal-sampling-inspired Self-Triggered control","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBCON11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05971S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300648","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300663,"authors":[{"name":"Cansu Arslan","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Cansu","lastName":"Arslan","id":"37085736471"},{"name":"Julien Poujaud","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Poujaud","id":"37871295200"},{"name":"Laurent Fesquet","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Fesquet","id":"37295549700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7888-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7887-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300663","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Histograms","Signal processing algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Kernel","Statistical analysis","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","medical signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["level-crossing thresholds","nonuniform sampling","data processing","nonstationary signals","inactive regions","embedded system","power consumption","level-crossing sampling scheme","LCSS optimization","input signal amplitude range","biomedical signals","nonuniform processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-uniform sampling","LCSS thresholds","low consumption","experimental biomedical signals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300663","abstract":"Data processing is usually based on uniformly sampled data in time. This sampling scheme is often unnecessary for non-stationary signals because samples are also taken in inactive regions. In case of embedded system, this useless samples significantly increase the power consumption. One solution to avoid this useless power consumption is the level crossing sampling scheme (LCSS). This method is not taking samples according to the time but according to amplitudes, therefore data are not sampling during inactive region. To optimize LCSS, thresholds need to be appropriately placed along the amplitude range of the input signal. In this paper, we present an algorithm to determine automatically these thresholds. This algorithm has been tested on experimental biomedical signals.

The proposed architecture is modelled with a hardware description language. Firstly, the reading method relies on reducing the output data flow of the image sensor. Therefore, the image sensor global activity is limited to the effective and relevant pixel information. Moreover, this reading technique is capable of suppressing spatial redundancies. Furthermore, the analog to digital converter, which usually is the most consuming component in a standard reading system, has been removed in our architecture. The fully asynchronous Register-Transfer level model of our reading system has been tested and validated using a real picture as a testbench. Finally, the comparison with a standard reading system shows that for a similar PSNR, we are able to drastically reduce the image data flow.","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300666","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300666.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RTL simulation of an asynchronous reading architecture for an event-driven image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300666/","displayDocTitle":"RTL simulation of an asynchronous reading architecture for an event-driven image sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554023","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300666/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RTL simulation of an asynchronous reading architecture for an event-driven image sensor","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBSP22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067095S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300668,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Mian Qaisar","affiliation":["Effat university, Jeddah, Saudia Arabia"],"firstName":"Saeed Mian","lastName":"Qaisar","id":"37064746100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7888-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7887-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300668","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"abstract":"This work is a contribution to enhance the signal processing chain required in mobile systems like satellites, cell phones, biomedical implants remote motors, etc. The system is powered by a battery therefore it must be power efficient. Filtering is a basic operation, almost required in every signal processing system. The classical filtering is time-invariant, the sampling frequency and the filter order remains unique. Therefore it can render a useless increase of the processing activity, especially in the case of sporadic signals. In this context an adaptive rate filtering technique, based on an event driven sampling is devised. It adapts the sampling frequency and the filter order by analysing the input signal characteristics. It correlates the processing activity to the signal variations. The computational complexity and the output quality of the proposed technique are compared to the classical one for a speech signal. Results show a drastic computational gain, of the proposed technique compared to the classical one, along with a comparable output quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An event driven technique for filtering computational complexity reduction","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300668","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300668.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300668","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Mathematical model","Filter banks","Computational complexity","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","filtering theory","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event driven technique","computational complexity reduction","speech signal processing chain","mobile system","sampling frequency","adaptive rate filtering technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational efficiency","Event driven sampling","Event driven processing","Activity selection","Processing error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An event driven technique for filtering computational complexity reduction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15554021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An event driven technique for filtering computational complexity reduction","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"EBSP24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081253S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7300673,"authors":[{"name":"Moritz B.

Insects, such as bees and flies, use optic flow to estimate the relative nearness to obstacles. Optic flow induced by ego-motion is composed of a translational and a rotational component. The segregation of both components is computationally and thus energetically expensive. Flies and bees actively separate the rotational and translational optic flow components via behaviour, i.e. by employing a saccadic strategy of flight and gaze control. Although robotic systems are able to mimic this gaze-strategy, the calculation of optic-flow fields from standard camera images remains time and energy consuming. To overcome this problem, we use a dynamic vision sensor (DVS), which provides event-based information about changes in contrast over time at each pixel location. To extract optic flow from this information, a plane-fitting algorithm estimating the relative velocity in a small spatio-temporal cuboid is used. The depth-structure is derived from the translational optic flow by using local properties of the retina. A collision avoidance direction is then computed from the event-based depth-structure of the environment. The system has successfully been tested on a robotic platform in open loop.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bioinspired event-driven collision avoidance algorithm based on optic flow","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300673","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300673.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300673","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collision avoidance","Optical sensors","Optical imaging","Robots","Voltage control","Optical computing","Biomedical optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","mobile agents","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired event-driven collision avoidance algorithm","mobile agent","translational optic flow components","rotational optic flow components","gaze control","flight control","dynamic vision sensor","plane-fitting algorithm","spatio-temporal cuboid","collision avoidance direction","event-based depth-structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bioinspired event-driven collision avoidance algorithm based on optic flow","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300673/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553980","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bioinspired event-driven collision avoidance algorithm based on optic flow","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"SS0212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074586S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7300674,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu Akolkar","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Himanshu","lastName":"Akolkar","id":"37085428911"},{"name":"David Reverter Valeiras","affiliation":["Vision Institute, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 (UPMC), Paris, France"],"firstName":"David Reverter","lastName":"Valeiras","id":"37085649090"},{"name":"Ryad Benosman","affiliation":["Vision Institute, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6 (UPMC), Paris, France"],"firstName":"Ryad","lastName":"Benosman","id":"38532062400"},{"name":"Chiara Bartolozzi","affiliation":["iCub Facility, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Bartolozzi","id":"37681790700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7888-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7887-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300674","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual-auditory saliency detection using event-driven visual sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Robot sensing systems","Collision avoidance","Microphones","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-visual systems","humanoid robots","image sensors","microphones","robot vision","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual-auditory saliency detection","event-driven visual sensors","event-based visual sensors","humanoid robot","collision detection","salient sensory events","temporal coincidence","frame-based sensors","sensory acquisition","spectral analysis","auditory signals"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel architecture for audio-visual saliency detection using event-based visual sensors and traditional microphones installed on the head of a humanoid robot. In the context of collision detection, salient sensory events must be detected at the same time in vision and in the auditory domain. Real collisions in the visual space can be distinguished from fake ones (e.g. due to movements of two objects that occlude each other) because they generate a sound at the time of collision. This temporal coincidence is extremely difficult to detect with frame-based sensors, that intrinsically add a fixed delay in the sensory acquisition or can miss the collision. The high temporal resolution of event-driven vision sensors together with a real time clustering and tracking algorithm allow for the detection of potential collisions with very low latency. Auditory events corresponding to collisions are detected using simple spectral analysis of auditory signals. The visual event can be therefore temporally integrated with coherently occurring auditory events to detect fast-transitions and disentangle real collisions from visual or auditory events that do not correspond to any. The proposed audio-visual collision detection is used in the context of human robot interaction, to detect people clapping in front of the robot and orient its gaze toward the perceived collision.","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300674","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300674.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300674/","displayDocTitle":"Visual-auditory saliency detection using event-driven visual sensors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554028","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300674/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual-auditory saliency detection using event-driven visual sensors","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"SS0213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05747S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7300683,"authors":[{"name":"Carl-Fredrik Lindberg","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden"],"firstName":"Carl-Fredrik","lastName":"Lindberg","id":"37085762343"},{"name":"Alf J.

For the illustrations an IIR filter, namely Butterworth, is used, but the results have a wider range of applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300694/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Noise and offset in the IIR filtering of event-based sampled data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise and offset in the IIR filtering of event-based sampled data","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"SS053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045735S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7300695,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Grybos","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Mathematics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Grybos","id":"37085444236"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7888-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7887-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300695","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Approximation methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-based sampled signal reconstruction","adaptive weight method","irregular sampling theory","send-on-delta sampling scheme","signal recovery"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300695","abstract":"The paper focuses on the event-driven signal processing and the application of irregular sampling theory and frames to the problems of the event-driven sampling and signal reconstruction.

Neuromorphic engineers mimics biological systems behavior to improve systems performance in solving engineering problems with low power consumption. This work presents a neuromorphic sensory integration scenario for measuring the rotation frequency of a motor using an AER DVS128 retina chip (Dynamic Vision Sensor) and a stereo auditory system on a FPGA completely event-based. Both of them transmit information with Address-Event-Representation (AER). This integration system uses a new AER monitor hardware interface, based on a Spartan-6 FPGA that allows two operational modes: real-time (up to 5 Mevps through USB2.0) and data logger mode (up to 20Mevps for 33.5Mev stored in onboard DDR RAM). The sensory integration allows reducing prediction error of the rotation speed of the motor since audio processing offers a concrete range of rpm, while DVS can be much more accurate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time motor rotation frequency detection with event-based visual and spike-based auditory AER sensory integration for FPGA","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300696","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300696.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time motor rotation frequency detection with event-based visual and spike-based auditory AER sensory integration for FPGA","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300696/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554007","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time motor rotation frequency detection with event-based visual and spike-based auditory AER sensory integration for FPGA","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"SS0611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076834S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300698,"authors":[{"name":"A.

DVS cameras generate spikes related to changes in light intensity. In this paper we present a 2D convolution event-driven processing core with 128\u00d7128 pixels. S-ConvNet is an Event-Driven processing method to extract event features from an input event flow. The nature of spiking systems is highly parallel, in general. Therefore, S-ConvNet processors can benefit from the parallelism offered by Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate the operation. Using 3 stages of pipeline and a parallel structure, results in updating the state of a 128 neuron row in just 12ns. This improves with respect to previously reported approaches.","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Event-based Control, Communication, and Signal Processing (EBCCSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274873/7300638/07300698.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Pipeline 128\u00d7128 pixel spiking convolution core for event-driven vision processing in FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EBCCSP.2015.7300698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast Pipeline 128\u00d7128 pixel spiking convolution core for event-driven vision processing in FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554031","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300698/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Pipeline 128\u00d7128 pixel spiking convolution core for event-driven vision processing in FPGAs","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"SS0613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064592S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7274873","isNumber":"7300638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7274873","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7300638","articleId":"7300698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300699,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The retinas provide visual information to the FPGA that processes it and obtains the center of mass of the pencil. Once this center of mass is averaged over time, it is used joint with the cart position provided by a flat potentiometer bar to compute the angle of the pencil from the vertical.

We propose to reuse as much tooling as possible, taking into account suitable options with regard to infrastructure management, then piggybacking as much advanced functionalities as possible in such kind of environment. In this sense, a widely used and competitive framework for Infrastructure-as-a-Service such as OpenStack, with its breadth in terms of feature coverage and expanded scope, looks like fitting the bill. This work therefore describes the approach and the solutions so far preliminary implemented for enabling Cloud-mediated interactions with droves of sensor- and actuator-hosting nodes by proposing Stack4Things, a framework for Sensing-and-Actuation-as-a-Service. In particular, we focused on describing the subsystem of Stack4Things devoted to resource control and management, highlighting relevant requirements and justifying how our proposed framework addresses them, while also opening up possibilities for a range of future extensions towards complete fulfillment of the Sensing-and-Actuation-as-a-Service vision.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stack4Things: An OpenStack-Based Framework for IoT","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.97","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300819.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.97","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300819/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stack4Things: An OpenStack-Based Framework for IoT","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300819/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stack4Things: An OpenStack-Based Framework for IoT","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"8103a204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06278S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299748","isNumber":"7300539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299748","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7300539","articleId":"7300819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7300838,"authors":[{"name":"Maram Akram","affiliation":["The German University in Cairo, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Maram","lastName":"Akram","id":"37085717812"},{"name":"Amal ElNahas","affiliation":["German University in Cairo, Cairo, EG"],"firstName":"Amal","lastName":"ElNahas"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8103-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8102-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300838","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Bit rate","Servers","Mathematical model","Mobile communication","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware offloading technique","mobile cloud computing","computation intensive applications","phone energy","battery life","energy savings","wireless network conditions","contextual network conditions","ThinkAir","computation offloading framework","static decision module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile cloud computing","computation offloading","energy prediction","delayed offloading","scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Combining mobile computing and cloud computing has opened the door recently for numerous applications that were not possible before due to the limited capabilities of mobile devices. Computation intensive applications are offloaded to the cloud, hence saving phone's energy and extending its battery life. However, energy savings are influenced by the wireless network conditions. In this paper, we propose considering contextual network conditions in deciding whether to offload to the cloud or not. An energy model is proposed to predict the energy consumed in offloading data under the current network conditions. Based on this prediction, a decision is taken whether to offload, to execute the application locally, or to delay offloading until detecting improvement in network conditions. We evaluated our approach by extending Think Air, a computation offloading framework proposed in [1], by our proposed energy model and delayed offloading algorithm. Experiments results showed considerable savings in energy with an average of 57% of the energy consumed by the application compared with the original static decision module implemented by Think Air.","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.45","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300838.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Offloading Technique for Mobile Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300838/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Offloading Technique for Mobile Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556755","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300838/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Offloading Technique for Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"8103a349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080779S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299748","isNumber":"7300539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299748","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7300539","articleId":"7300838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7300842,"authors":[{"name":"Claus Pahl","affiliation":["Irish Centre for Cloud Computing and Commerce IC4 & Lero, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Pahl","id":"37304101600"},{"name":"Brian Lee","affiliation":["Irish Centre for Cloud Computing and Commerce IC4, Athlone Insititute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085736679"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8103-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8102-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300842","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2840},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Platform as a service","Computer architecture","Packaging","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","cloud computing","computer centres","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge cloud architectures","cloud technology","fog computing","lightweight virtualisation","host application","platform services","logistics","containerisation","virtual machines","platform-as-a-service clouds","PaaS clouds","application orchestration","service orchestration","application packaging mechanism","cluster technology","distributed multicloud platforms","networked nodes","data centres"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Container","Cluster","Virtualisation","Cloud Computing","PaaS","Multi-cloud","Edge Cloud","Orchestration","Topology"]}],"abstract":"Cloud technology is moving towards more distribution across multi-clouds and the inclusion of various devices, as evident through IoT and network integration in the context of edge cloud and fog computing. Generally, lightweight virtualisation solutions are beneficial for this architectural setting with smaller, but still virtualised devices to host application and platform services, and the logistics required to manage this. Containerisation is currently discussed as a lightweight virtualisation solution. In addition to having benefits over traditional virtual machines in the cloud in terms of size and flexibility, containers are specifically relevant for platform concerns typically dealt with Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds such as application packaging and orchestration. For the edge cloud environment, application and service orchestration can help to manage and orchestrate applications through containers as an application packaging mechanism. We review edge cloud requirements and discuss the suitability container and cluster technology of that arise from having to facilitate applications through distributed multi-cloud platforms build from a range of networked nodes ranging from data centres to small devices, which we refer to here as edge cloud.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Containers and Clusters for Edge Cloud Architectures -- A Technology Review","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.35","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300842.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Containers and Clusters for Edge Cloud Architectures -- A Technology Review","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300842/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556810","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containers and Clusters for Edge Cloud Architectures -- A Technology Review","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"8103a379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052047S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299748","isNumber":"7300539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299748","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"7300539","articleId":"7300842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":7300844,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Penzel","affiliation":["School of Business, Economics and Statistics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Penzel","id":"37085740829"},{"name":"Natalia Kryvinska","affiliation":["School of Business, Economics and Statistics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Natalia","lastName":"Kryvinska","id":"37297240400"},{"name":"Christine Strauss","affiliation":["School of Business, Economics and Statistics, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Strauss","id":"37318049300"},{"name":"Michal Gregu","affiliation":["Dept. of Inf.

A detailed SWOT Analysis examines the most important factors to be considered for the future of cloud computing. Based on the outcomes, the real value of cloud computing is discussed, followed by the challenges for the future development of cloud computing. Those points finally lead to a statement regarding whether cloud computing represents a new paradigm or if it is just an upcoming trend of the IT industry. The result is that cloud computing is on its way to become the new hosting paradigm. However, there are many issues that will have to be dealt with along the way. As small enterprises start to accept and integrate cloud structures, even bigger enterprises and global players will be introduced. In order to become the new hosting paradigm, further development and an adoption of non-standard technologies by a broad spectrum of users will be necessary.","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.102","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300844.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","startPage":"391","endPage":"397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Future of Cloud Computing: A SWOT Analysis and Predictions of Development","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Future of Cloud Computing: A SWOT Analysis and Predictions of Development","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300844/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556768","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7300844/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Future of Cloud Computing: A SWOT Analysis and Predictions of Development","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"8103a391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090139S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299748","isNumber":"7300539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299748","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7300539","articleId":"7300844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300857,"authors":[{"name":"Narasimha Rao Vajjhala","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of New York Tirana, Tirana, Albania"],"firstName":"Narasimha Rao","lastName":"Vajjhala","id":"37085727473"},{"name":"Kenneth David Strang","affiliation":["USA & CEO, State University of New York, Queensbury, Australia"],"firstName":"Kenneth David","lastName":"Strang","id":"37085733628"},{"name":"Zhaohao Sun","affiliation":["Department of Business Studies, PNG University of Technology, Lae, PNG"],"firstName":"Zhaohao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085726941"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8103-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8102-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300857","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300857","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Terrorism","Data models","Analytical models","Decision making","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","data mining","data visualisation","data warehouses","decision making","globalisation","public administration","research and development","statistical analysis","terrorism"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical modeling","open big data visualization","terrorism case study","open big data analytics","correspondence analysis","big data analytical technique","qualitative big data type","hidden factor relationship","strategic decision making","open meta big dataset","terrorist activity","keyword frequency","public news article","statistical software","SPSS","global terrorism big dataset","research and development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["open big data analytics","correspondence analysis","global terrorism open meta big dataset","statistical modeling","data mining","data warehouse"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.15","endPage":"496","startPage":"489","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Modeling and Visualizing Open Big Data Using a Terrorism Case Study","abstract":"This study addressed the literature gap, identified by other researchers, that there are too few examples of applied empirical open big data analytics.

However, this objective is challenging to achieve due to the limited capabilities of the cloudlet system which limit the number of available services on each cloudlet system. This will force different cloudlets to cooperate in order to meet the users demands for different types of services. Moreover, the cooperation will require routing of user requests from the local cloudlet to a remote cloudlet that provide the requested service using a backbone network. This cooperation will increase the total power consumption per request which will include both the user to the local cloudlet power consumption and the power consumption for routing the request to a remote cloudlet. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the power consumption for large scale cooperative cloudlets deployments. The evaluation of the proposed model under different realistic scenarios shows that it can be used to accurately optimize power consumption in large scale MCC systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300885.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"674","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Optimization of Large Scale Mobile Cloud Computing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile communication","Computational modeling","Mobile computing","Power demand","Mobile handsets","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","mobile computing","optimisation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption optimization","large scale mobile cloud computing systems","large scale MCC systems","service level agreement","SLA","user request routing","backbone network","large scale cooperative cloudlet deployments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power Optimization of Large Scale Mobile Cloud Computing Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300885/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556797","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Optimization of Large Scale Mobile Cloud Computing Systems","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"8103a670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073236S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299748","isNumber":"7300539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299748","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7300539","articleId":"7300885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300909,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Marsico","affiliation":["CREATE-NET, Trento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Marsico","id":"37085625807"},{"name":"Attilio Broglio","affiliation":["CREATE-NET, Trento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Attilio","lastName":"Broglio","id":"38235401900"},{"name":"Massimo Vecchio","affiliation":["CREATE-NET, Trento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Vecchio","id":"37671393900"},{"name":"Federico Michele Facca","affiliation":["CREATE-NET, Trento, ITALY"],"firstName":"Federico Michele","lastName":"Facca","id":"37829387800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8103-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8102-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300909","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Logic gates","Sensors","Clouds","Graphical user interfaces","Actuators","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","embedded systems","Internet of Things","internetworking","Linux","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","cloud computing paradigm","smart enterprise scenario","CC paradigm","sensing capability","actuation capability","microcontroller","short-range radio module","identity management","complex event processing","data contextualization","cloud service","computational requirement","memory requirement","Linux embedded micro-pc","IoT gateway"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","Cloud Computing","FIWARE Techologies","Smart Environments"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a fully-working proof of concept centered around a smart enterprise scenario and able to shed led on the power offered by linking the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Cloud Computing (CC) paradigms together.

It has been understood from the review reports that integration of IoT and Cloud Computing is in its infantile phase and it has not been extended to all application domains due to its inadequate security architecture. Hence, in this paper a novel integrated secured and intelligent architecture for the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing is proposed. This is a unique intelligent architecture adoptable for the public to access diversified smart applications and services distributed in the cloud, anywhere, anytime, any device and any network irrespective of the underlying technologies in a smart environment. The cloud services are integrated and connected through a novel IP/MPLS (Internet Protocol/Multiprotocol Label Switching) core. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used to ensure complete protection against the security risks such as confidentiality, integrity, privacy and authentication. This model eliminates ambiguity, ensures security with enhanced performance and realizes the vision of \"one intelligent smart card for any applications and transactions\". The performance of the proposed architecture is tested by establishing a test bed in a simulated environment and the results are reported.","doi":"10.1109/FiCloud.2015.23","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299748/7300539/07300911.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FiCloud.2015.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Development of Integrated, Secured and Intelligent Architecture for Internet of Things and Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300911/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Development of Integrated, Secured and Intelligent Architecture for Internet of Things and Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300911/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556734","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Development of Integrated, Secured and Intelligent Architecture for Internet of Things and Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"8103a817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053468S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299748","isNumber":"7300539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299748","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7300539","articleId":"7300911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300956,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Yu Ha","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hsin-Yu","lastName":"Ha","id":"37893509400"},{"name":"Shu-Ching Chen","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shu-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277598000"},{"name":"Mei-Ling Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mei-Ling","lastName":"Shyu","id":"38320096400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6656-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300956","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Sampling methods","Feature extraction","Correlation","Training data","Multimedia communication","Videos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","information retrieval","multimedia computing","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative-based sampling","multimedia retrieval","multimedia data","meaningful semantic concepts","data imbalance problem","dataset rebalancing","data sampling","data pruning","feature selection","negative instance identification","negative ranking score","TRECVID dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling","FC-MST","Feature Selection","Multimedia"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300956","abstract":"Nowadays, in such a high-tech living lifestyle, profusion of multimedia data are produced and propagated around the world. To identify meaningful semantic concepts from the large amount of data, one of the major challenges is called the data imbalance problem. Data imbalance occurs when the number of positive instances (i.e., instances which contain the target concept) is greatly less than the number of negative instances (i.e., instances which do not contain the target concept). In other words, the ratio between positive and negative instances is extremely low. Rebalancing the dataset is usually proposed to resolve the problem by sampling or data pruning. In this paper, we propose a sampling method which consists of three stages, namely selecting features to identify the negative instances, producing negative ranking scores, and performing sampling. The method is compared with some other existing methods on the TRECVID dataset and is demonstrated to have better performance.","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2015.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2015.20","startPage":"64","endPage":"71","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299513/7300933/07300956.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative-Based Sampling for Multimedia Retrieval","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Negative-Based Sampling for Multimedia Retrieval","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300956/","accessionNumber":"15556698","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300956/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative-Based Sampling for Multimedia Retrieval","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6656a064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098819S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299513","isNumber":"7300933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299513","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7300933","articleId":"7300956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7300969,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Bahrami","affiliation":["University of California Merced, Merced, CA, US"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Bahrami"},{"name":"Mukesh Singhal","affiliation":["University of California Merced, Merced, CA, US"],"firstName":"Mukesh","lastName":"Singhal"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6656-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7300969","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic cloud computing service-oriented architecture","DCCSOA","in-house IT services","elastic on-demand computing","Internet","International Data Corporation","IDC","*-as-a-services layers","*aaS layers","template-as-a-service","TaaS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cloud Architecture","Cloud Customization","Cloud Standardization","*-as-a-Service","SOA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7300969","abstract":"The emerging field of Cloud Computing provides several advantages over traditional in-house IT services, such as accessing to elastic on-demand computing and storage over the Internet, and cost effective pay-per-use subscription plans. However, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), cloud computing has several issues, such as a lack of standardization, a lack of customization, and limited interoperability. In addition, there is an increasing demand for introduction and migration of a variety of services to cloud computing systems, which are abstract their offering services into various *-as-a-Services (*aaS) layers. Although each such service provides a new feature (e.g., simulation services in cloud), it aggravates the issues due to the lack of standardization and inability to customize services by a vendor because each *aaS has its own features, requirements and output. In this paper, we propose a cloud architecture to alleviate issues associated with standardization and customization. In the cloud, the proposed architecture uses a single layer, called Template-as-a-Service (TaaS), to provide: (i) a single service layer for interaction with all resources and major cloud services (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and *aaS), (ii) a standardization for existing services and future *aaS across different cloud environments, and (iii) a customizable architecture which can be modified on demand by a cloud vendor, and its partners to provide the flexibility on cloud computing systems. A comparison with previous studies show that the proposed architecture provides customization and standardization for cloud services with minimum modifications.","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2015.33","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299513/7300933/07300969.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2015.33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCCSOA: A Dynamic Cloud Computing Service-Oriented Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7300969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"DCCSOA: A Dynamic Cloud Computing Service-Oriented Architecture","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7300969/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556653","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCCSOA: A Dynamic Cloud Computing Service-Oriented Architecture","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6656a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074594S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299513","isNumber":"7300933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299513","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7300933","articleId":"7300969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7300975,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Prusa","affiliation":["Florida Atlantic University"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Prusa","id":"37085648057"},{"name":"Taghi M.

In particular, the Random Forest classifier has been an effective and popular algorithm due to its relatively good classification performance and its ease of use. However, Random Forest does not account for class imbalance which is known for decreasing classification performance and increasing bias towards the majority class. In this study, we seek to determine if the inclusion of data sampling will improve the performance of the Random Forest classifier. In order to test the effect of data sampling, we used Random Undersampling along with two post-sampling class distribution ratios: 35:65 and 50:50 (minority:majority). Additionally, we also built inductive models with Random Forest when no data sampling technique was applied, so we can observe the true effect of the data sampling. All three options were tested on a series of fifteen imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Our results show that data sampling does improve the classification performance of Random Forest, especially when using the 50:50 post-sampling class distribution ratio. However, statistical analysis shows that the increase in performance is not statistically significant. Thus, we can state that while data sampling does improve the classification performance of Random Forest, it is not a necessary step as the classifier is fairly robust to imbalanced data on its own.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7301012/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556667","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Data Sampling When Using Random Forest on Imbalanced Bioinformatics Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Data Sampling When Using Random Forest on Imbalanced Bioinformatics Data","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6656a457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081433S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299513","isNumber":"7300933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299513","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7300933","articleId":"7301012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7301016,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Adrian Galvan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California State University San Marcos, San Marcos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard Adrian","lastName":"Galvan","id":"37085681555"},{"name":"Ahmad Reza Hadaegh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California State University San Marcos, San Marcos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad Reza","lastName":"Hadaegh","id":"38558055700"},{"name":"Matinehalsadat Kashani Moghaddam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, California State University San Marcos, San Marcos, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Matinehalsadat Kashani","lastName":"Moghaddam","id":"37085690021"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6656-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7301016","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Drugs","Training","Computational modeling","Adaptation models","Biochemistry","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","enzymes","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation","QSAR","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pharmacological research","differential evolution","binary particle swarm optimization","nonlinear adaptive boosting random forest regression","nonlinear QSAR model","evolutionary computation","dimeric Aryl \u03b2-Diketo acid","biological mechanism","protein transfer","multiple linear regression machine learning strategy","MLR machine learning strategy","hybridized differential evolution-binary particle swarm optimization algorithm","DE-BPSO algorithm","nonlinear random forest regression strategy","nonlinear RFR strategy","adaptive boosting","AdaBoost","HIV-1 protein enzyme activity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)","Differential Evolution-Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (DE-BPSO)","Quantitative StructureActivity Relationship (QSAR)","and Random Forest Regression (RFR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRI.2015.80","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299513/7300933/07301016.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","startPage":"485","endPage":"490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2015.80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Pharmacological Research of HIV-1 Integrase Inhibition Using Differential Evolution - Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and Nonlinear Adaptive Boosting Random Forest Regression","abstract":"In this work, we present results produced from a nonlinear QSAR model developed and implemented using evolutionary computation and Random Forest Regression to study the effectiveness of dimeric Aryl \u00df-Diketo Acids on HIV-1 Integrase enzyme inhibition. Dimeric Aryl \u00df-Diketo Acids have been proven to be effective inhibitors of the biological mechanism of protein transfer known as HIV-integrase. This research extends a previous study of Aryl \u00df-Diketo Acids for HIV-1 Integrase inhibition [1] that used linear QSAR models implemented using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) machine learning strategy and a hybridized Differential Evolution-Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (DE-BPSO) algorithm to select and identify, respectively, drug descriptors having the greatest inhibitory effect on HIV-1 Integrase. This comparative study uses a non-linear Random Forest Regression (RFR) strategy with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) to generate QSAR models with greater predictive qualities in identifying optimal drug feature descriptors that can more effectively inhibit HIV protein enzyme activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301016/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15556631","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301016/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Pharmacological Research of HIV-1 Integrase Inhibition Using Differential Evolution - Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and Nonlinear Adaptive Boosting Random Forest Regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Pharmacological Research of HIV-1 Integrase Inhibition Using Differential Evolution - Binary Particle Swarm Optimization and Nonlinear Adaptive Boosting Random Forest Regression","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6656a485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06292S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299513","isNumber":"7300933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299513","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7300933","articleId":"7301016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7301024,"authors":[{"name":"Eslam Amer","affiliation":["Computer Science Department Faculty of Computers and Information, Benha University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Eslam","lastName":"Amer","id":"37085609977"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6656-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7301024","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Semantics","Encyclopedias","Electronic publishing","Internet","Web pages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","query processing","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web search engines","ontology learning","information sources","information availability","Web page content understanding","ontological concepts","relevancy measure","semantic similarity","query representation","Pearson correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semantic Search","Ontology learning","Search Engine ranking"]}],"abstract":"With the fast growth rate of information availability through the World Wide Web, search engines' ranking become limited to deal with such enormous amount of information. Web search engines should be enriched with methodologies that enable it to understand the content of Web pages, then to align pages to the correct query category that highly match its content. In this paper, a proposed system is introduced to deal with the abundance of information by automatically understand the content of a Web page, and semantically model the ontological concepts that exist inside it. The semantic relations between ontological concepts are automatically given a score or weight based on its influence to the given query. The weighted semantic relations between ontological concepts can be viewed as a signature for the query, the highly similarity of an article to this signature, the more relevant to the query. A new relevancy measure is introduced to semantically re-rank or classify Web pages based on computing the semantic similarity of the weighted intersection ratio between ontological concepts extracted from retrieved Web pages, and ontological concepts that represents the query. Results shows that the proposed system has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (0.890) to human judgments which outperforms semantic similarity state-of-the-art methods and Web-based methods. The proposed model, was tested to re-rank Web pages according to the semantic relevancy of the query, experiments shows that it has the highest convergence to expert ranking order of Web pages compared to other Web search engines.","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2015.87","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299513/7300933/07301024.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2015.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing Efficiency of Web Search Engines through Ontology Learning from Unstructured Information Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301024/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Efficiency of Web Search Engines through Ontology Learning from Unstructured Information Sources","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556674","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301024/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Efficiency of Web Search Engines through Ontology Learning from Unstructured Information Sources","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"6656a542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124737S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299513","isNumber":"7300933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299513","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7300933","articleId":"7301024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7301068,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Kosan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Kosan","id":"38546912900"},{"name":"Martin Jara","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Jara","id":"37085404406"},{"name":"Vojtech Blahnik","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vojtech","lastName":"Blahnik","id":"37085373324"},{"name":"Zdenek Peroutka","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Peroutka","id":"37271624200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-0261-0386-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-8-0261-0385-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1803-7232"}],"articleNumber":"7301068","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Inverters","Pulse width modulation","Synchronization","Topology","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","field programmable gate arrays","frequency modulation","network topology","power transformers","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal configurable sinusoidal modulator","FPGA","multilevel cascaded H-bridge resonant converter","pulse frequency modulation","power electronic transformer topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cascaded H-bridges","active front end","filed programmable gate array (FPGA)","multilevel converter"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a universal sinusoidal modulator developed primarily for the multilevel cascaded H-bridges converters.

Whereas recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are designed for learning contextual dependencies among sequential data by using the recurrent (feedback) connections. In this work, we propose the convolutional recurrent neural network (C-RNN), which learns the spatial dependencies between image regions to enhance the discriminative power of image representation. The C-RNN is trained in an end-to-end manner from raw pixel images. CNN layers are firstly processed to generate middle level features. RNN layer is then learned to encode spatial dependencies. The C-RNN can learn better image representation, especially for images with obvious spatial contextual dependencies.

Encouraged by the recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we propose an effective deep learning framework to generate binary hash codes for fast image retrieval. Our idea is that when the data labels are available, binary codes can be learned by employing a hidden layer for representing the latent concepts that dominate the class labels. The utilization of the CNN also allows for learning image representations. Unlike other supervised methods that require pair-wised inputs for binary code learning, our method learns hash codes and image representations in a point-wised manner, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art hashing algorithms on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. We further demonstrate its scalability and efficacy on a large-scale dataset of 1 million clothing images.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301269","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301269.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","startPage":"27","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning of binary hash codes for fast image retrieval","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning of binary hash codes for fast image retrieval","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301269/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554150","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7301269/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning of binary hash codes for fast image retrieval","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W01P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060649S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7301270,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Azizpour","affiliation":["KTH (Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Azizpour","id":"37085380694"},{"name":"Ali Sharif Razavian","affiliation":["KTH (Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Ali Sharif","lastName":"Razavian","id":"37085372130"},{"name":"Josephine Sullivan","affiliation":["KTH (Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Josephine","lastName":"Sullivan","id":"37398219100"},{"name":"Atsuto Maki","affiliation":["KTH (Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Atsuto","lastName":"Maki","id":"37282585300"},{"name":"Stefan Carlsson","affiliation":["KTH (Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Carlsson","id":"37270936300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301270","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":182,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Sun","Training","Positron emission tomography","Computer vision","Standards","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep representations","ConvNets","representation learning method","visual recognition tasks","feature extraction","image representation","feedforward unit activation","labeled dataset"]}],"abstract":"Evidence is mounting that ConvNets are the best representation learning method for recognition.

In this paper, we present a straightforward framework for better image representation by combining the two approaches. To take advantages of both representations, we extract a fair amount of multi-scale dense local activations from a pre-trained CNN. We then aggregate the activations by Fisher kernel framework, which has been modified with a simple scale-wise normalization essential to make it suitable for CNN activations. Our representation demonstrates new state-of-the-art performances on three public datasets: 80.78% (Acc.) on MIT Indoor 67, 83.20% (mAP) on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 91.28% (Acc.) on Oxford 102 Flowers. The results suggest that our proposal can be used as a primary image representation for better performances in wide visual recognition tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301274.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scale pyramid pooling for deep convolutional representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image representation","Visualization","Aggregates","Image recognition","Accuracy","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","image recognition","image representation","invariance","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale pyramid pooling","deep convolutional representation","image representation","low-level local descriptors","deep neural activations","convolutional neural networks","mid-level representation","geometric invariance properties","straightforward framework","multiscale dense local activations","Fisher kernel framework","scale-wise normalization","CNN activations","MIT Indoor 67","PASCAL VOC2007","visual recognition tasks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scale pyramid pooling for deep convolutional representation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301274/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554227","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scale pyramid pooling for deep convolutional representation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W01P09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076128S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301275,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Bianco","affiliation":["University of Milan-Bicocca, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Bianco","id":"37408378000"},{"name":"Claudio Cusano","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cusano","id":"37294068600"},{"name":"Raimondo Schettini","affiliation":["University of Milan-Bicocca, Italy"],"firstName":"Raimondo","lastName":"Schettini","id":"37294067800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301275","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":343},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301275","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Estimation","Kernel","Lighting","Training","Feature extraction","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image colour analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color constancy","convolutional neural network","image patches","hand-crafted features","max pooling","network structure","feature learning","regression analysis","optimization process","RAW images","local illuminant estimation ability","CNN"]}],"abstract":"In this work we describe a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately predict the scene illumination.

In this framework, the task of learning to detect and localize individual object instances is seen as a harder task that can be evaded by casting the problem as that of computing a regression value from hand-crafted image features. In this paper we explore the features that are learned when training a counting convolutional neural network in order to understand their underlying representation. To this end we define a counting problem for MNIST data and show that the internal representation of the network is able to classify digits in spite of the fact that no direct supervision was provided for them during training. We also present preliminary results about a deep network that is able to count the number of pedestrians in a scene.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Training","Supervised learning","Proposals","Accuracy","Visualization","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep object features","count learning","learning strategy","object instances detection","object instances localization","regression value","hand-crafted image features","counting convolutional neural network training","counting problem","MNIST data","network internal representation","digits classification","deep network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301276","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301276.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to count with deep object features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to count with deep object features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301276/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301276/","accessionNumber":"15554174","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to count with deep object features","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W01P11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054836S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7301284,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sabokrou","affiliation":["Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Sabokrou","id":"38234848300"},{"name":"Mahmood Fathy","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Fathy","id":"37085342278"},{"name":"Mojtaba Hoseini","affiliation":["Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Hoseini","id":"37853170900"},{"name":"Reinhard Klette","affiliation":["Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Klette","id":"37270732100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301284","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":771},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Feature extraction","Training","Real-time systems","Gaussian distribution","Benchmark testing","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","real-time systems","security of data","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time anomaly detection","real-time localization","crowded scenes","non-overlapping cubic patches","local descriptors","global descriptors","video properties","cost-effective Gaussian classifiers","structure similarity","sparse auto-encoder","UCSD ped2","UMN benchmarks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method for real-time anomaly detection and localization in crowded scenes.

The local and global features are based on structure similarity between adjacent patches and the features learned in an unsupervised way, using a sparse auto-encoder.

In real-world scenarios, many surveillance cameras capture data in the NIR (near infrared) spectrum. However, most datasets accessible to law enforcement have been collected in the VIS (visible light) domain. Thus, there exists a need to match NIR to VIS face images. In this paper, we approach the problem by developing a method to reconstruct VIS images in the NIR domain and vice-versa. This approach is more applicable to real-world scenarios since it does not involve having to project millions of VIS database images into learned common subspace for subsequent matching.

We have taken this idea to the extreme. In segmented images, we ignore the interior of the components and focus on their boundaries only. Furthermore, by assuming spatial compactness of the components, the similarity criterion can be approximated by sampling only a small number of points on the normals passing through a sparse set of keypoints. This leads to an order-of-magnitude speed advantage in comparison with classical registration algorithms. Surprisingly, despite the crude approximation, the accuracy is comparable. By virtue of the segmentation and by using a suitable similarity criterion such as mutual information on labels, the method can handle large appearance differences and large variability in the segmentations. The segmentation does not need not be perfectly coherent between images and over-segmentation is acceptable. We demonstrate the performance of the method on a range of different datasets, including histological slices and Drosophila imaginal discs, using rigid transformations.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301311","startPage":"11","endPage":"19","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301311.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast registration of segmented images by normal sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast registration of segmented images by normal sampling","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301311/","accessionNumber":"15554256","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301311/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast registration of segmented images by normal sampling","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W12P02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074471S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7301312,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre de Br\u00e9bisson","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"de Br\u00e9bisson","id":"37087485100"},{"name":"Giovanni Montana","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Montana","id":"37428231900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301312","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Neurons","Three-dimensional displays","Biological neural networks","Training","Feature extraction","Magnetic resonance imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anatomical brain segmentation","magnetic resonance image segmentation","MRI segmentation","deep artificial neural network","regional centroids","global spatial consistency","MICCAI 2012"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301312","abstract":"We present a novel approach to automatically segment magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain into anatomical regions. Our methodology is based on a deep artificial neural network that assigns each voxel in an MR image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. The inputs of the network capture information at different scales around the voxel of interest: 3D and orthogonal 2D intensity patches capture a local spatial context while downscaled large 2D orthogonal patches and distances to the regional centroids enforce global spatial consistency. Contrary to commonly used segmentation methods, our technique does not require any non-linear registration of the MR images. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided for the MICCAI 2012 challenge on multi-atlas labelling, which consists of 35 manually segmented MR images of the brain. We obtained competitive results (mean dice coefficient 0.725, error rate 0.163) showing the potential of our approach. To our knowledge, our technique is the first to tackle the anatomical segmentation of the whole brain using deep neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301312","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301312.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep neural networks for anatomical brain segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Deep neural networks for anatomical brain segmentation","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301312/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554161","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural networks for anatomical brain segmentation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W12P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063036S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301316,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Juefei-Xu","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Juefei-Xu","id":"38363888200"},{"name":"Dipan K.

However, in many real-world scenarios, when the face of an individual is occluded or degraded in some way, commercial recognition systems fail to accept the face for evaluation or simply return unusable matched faces. In these kinds of cases, forensic experts rely on image processing techniques and tools, to make the face fit to be processed by the commercial recognition systems (e.g. use partial face images from another subject to fill in the occluded parts of the face of interest, or have a tight crop around the face). In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of commercial recognition systems to such forensic techniques. More specifically, we study the change in the rank-1 identification result that is caused by forensic processing of faces-of-interest that are unusable by the commercial recognition systems. Further, forensic processing of such faces is more of an art and it is extremely difficult to process faces consistently such that there is a predictable effect on the rank-n identification result. This study is meant to serve as an evaluation of the effect of a few forensic techniques intended to allow commercial recognition systems to process and match face images that were otherwise unusable. Our results indicate that COTS FRS can be sensitive to the subjectivity in facial part swapping and cropping, resulting in inconsistencies in the identification rankings and similarity scores.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301316","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301316.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A preliminary investigation on the sensitivity of COTS face recognition systems to forensic analyst-style face processing for occlusions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301316/","displayDocTitle":"A preliminary investigation on the sensitivity of COTS face recognition systems to forensic analyst-style face processing for occlusions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554226","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301316/","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A preliminary investigation on the sensitivity of COTS face recognition systems to forensic analyst-style face processing for occlusions","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W13P04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088939S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301325,"authors":[{"name":"Andras Rozsa","affiliation":["University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Rozsa","id":"37085689554"},{"name":"Albert E.

However, compared with event recognition in videos, there are much fewer research works on event recognition in images. This paper addresses the issue of event recognition from images and proposes an effective method with deep neural networks. Specifically, we design a new architecture, called Object-Scene Convolutional Neural Network (OS-CNN). This architecture is decomposed into object net and scene net, which extract useful information for event understanding from the perspective of objects and scene context, respectively. Meanwhile, we investigate different network architectures for OS-CNN design, and adapt the deep (AlexNet) and very-deep (GoogLeNet) networks to the task of event recognition. Furthermore, we find that the deep and very-deep networks are complementary to each other. Finally, based on the proposed OS-CNN and comparative study of different network architectures, we come up with a solution of five-stream CNN for the track of cultural event recognition at the ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) challenge 2015.

A common approach to facial expression recognition in video is to first convert variable-length expression sequences into a vector representation by computing summary statistics of image-level features or of spatio-temporal features. These representations are then passed to a discriminative classifier such as a support vector machines (SVM). However, these approaches don't fully exploit the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), provide a method for modeling variable-length expression time-series. Although HMMs have been explored in the past for expression classification, they are rarely used since classification performance is often lower than discriminative approaches, which may be attributed to the challenges of estimating generative models. This paper explores an approach for combining the modeling strength of HMMs with the discriminative power of SVMs via a model-based similarity framework. Each example is first instantiated into an Exemplar-HMM model. A probabilistic kernel is then used to compute a kernel matrix, to be used along with an SVM classifier. This paper proposes that dynamical models such as HMMs are advantageous for the facial expression problem space, when employed in a discriminative, exemplar-based classification framework. The approach yields state-of-the-art results on both posed (CK+ and OULU-CASIA) and spontaneous (FEEDTUM and AM-FED) expression datasets highlighting the performance advantages of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exemplar Hidden Markov Models for classification of facial expressions in videos","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301350","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301350.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Exemplar Hidden Markov Models for classification of facial expressions in videos","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301350/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554230","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exemplar Hidden Markov Models for classification of facial expressions in videos","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W22P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078012S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301352,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Levi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, The Open University of Israel"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Levi","id":"37085697911"},{"name":"Tal Hassncer","affiliation":["Open University of Israel, Raanana, IL"],"firstName":"Tal","lastName":"Hassncer"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301352","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":444,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":2754},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Benchmark testing","Training","Estimation","Face recognition","Computer architecture","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture","social networking (online)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic age classification","automatic gender classification","social platforms","social media","real-world images","face recognition","representation learning","deep-convolutional neural networks","CNN","convolutional net architecture","Adience benchmark"]}],"abstract":"Automatic age and gender classification has become relevant to an increasing amount of applications, particularly since the rise of social platforms and social media.

We evaluate our method on the recent Adience benchmark for age and gender estimation and show it to dramatically outperform current state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301352","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301352.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age and gender classification using convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301352/","displayDocTitle":"Age and gender classification using convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301352/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554224","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age and gender classification using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W22P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079722S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"444","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7301360,"authors":[{"name":"Guyue Zhou","affiliation":["Dajiang Innovations Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Guyue","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085489402"},{"name":"Lu Fang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, P.R.

All of them typically consider the pedestrians in a standing pose, but this assumption is not always applicable. It is the case of embedded camera systems used for crowd monitoring or in driving assistance systems for big vehicles maneuvering. Such systems are commonly installed as higher as possible and make use of fish-eye lenses to provide a top and wide field of view. Actually, such configurations introduce both perspective and optical distortions in the image that, even when corrected, still provide stretched silhouettes that can hardly be detected by cutting-edge pedestrian detection algorithms. In this paper we focus on this scenario, showing (a) that one of the most effective models for pedestrian detection, that is the Deformable Part Model (DPM), can be efficiently implemented in FPGA to dramatically speed up the computation, and (b) how it can be modified for dealing with highly distorted pictures of humans. The resulting framework, dubbed Deformable Part Model for Local Spatial Deformations (DPM-LSD), gives convincing figure of merits in terms of accuracy and throughput, on a new top-view fish-eye based pedestrian dataset (dubbed Fish-Eyed Pedestrians), also comparing with widely-used competitors (standard DPM and Dalal-Triggs).","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301368","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301368.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based pedestrian detection under strong distortions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301368/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based pedestrian detection under strong distortions","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301368/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554207","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based pedestrian detection under strong distortions","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W24P10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053188S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301371,"authors":[{"name":"Suhas Lohit","affiliation":["School of Electrical Computer, and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Suhas","lastName":"Lohit","id":"37085762484"},{"name":"Kuldeep Kulkarni","affiliation":["School of Arts, Media and Engineering Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Kuldeep","lastName":"Kulkarni","id":"38550413700"},{"name":"Pavan Turaga","affiliation":["School of Arts, Media and Engineering Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Pavan","lastName":"Turaga","id":"37428672600"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085375319"},{"name":"Aswin C.

One popular architecture for spatial multiplexing is the single-pixel camera (SPC), which acquires coded measurements of the scene with pseudo-random spatial masks. Significant theoretical developments over the past few years provide a means for reconstruction of the original imagery from coded measurements at sub-Nyquist sampling rates. Yet, accurate reconstruction generally requires high measurement rates and high signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we enquire if one can perform high-level visual inference problems (e.g. face recognition or action recognition) from compressive cameras without the need for image reconstruction. This is an interesting question since in many practical scenarios, our goals extend beyond image reconstruction. However, most inference tasks often require non-linear features and it is not clear how to extract such features directly from compressed measurements. In this paper, we show that one can extract nontrivial correlational features directly without reconstruction of the imagery. As a specific example, we consider the problem of face recognition beyond the visible spectrum e.g in the short-wave infra-red region (SWIR) - where pixels are expensive. We base our framework on smashed filters which suggests that inner-products between high-dimensional signals can be computed in the compressive domain to a high degree of accuracy. We collect a new face image dataset of 30 subjects, obtained using an SPC. Using face recognition as an example, we show that one can indeed perform reconstruction-free inference with a very small loss of accuracy at very high compression ratios of 100 and more.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301371","startPage":"16","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301371.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction-free inference on compressive measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Face recognition","Image reconstruction","Feature extraction","Image coding","Face","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","face recognition","feature extraction","image coding","image reconstruction","inference mechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconstruction-free inference","compressive measurements","spatial-multiplexing cameras","imaging devices","single-pixel camera","SPC","pseudorandom spatial masks","coded measurements","subNyquist sampling rates","signal-to-noise ratios","high-level visual inference problems","face recognition","action recognition","compressive cameras","image reconstruction","nonlinear feature extraction","correlational features","short-wave infrared region","SWIR","high-dimensional signals"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction-free inference on compressive measurements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554149","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction-free inference on compressive measurements","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W26P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090327S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7301372,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Heinz","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Heinz","id":"37085622297"},{"name":"Guido Brunnett","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Brunnett","id":"37267491800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301372","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Cameras","Dynamic range","Color","Three-dimensional displays","Colored noise","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","cameras","image colour analysis","image sampling","photography","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D color transfer functions","dense sampling","HDR photography","color adjustments","brightness adjustments","CTF","sampling density","DLP projectors","color wheels","color samples","DSLR camera","high dynamic range photography","sequential spot measurements","sparse sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301372","abstract":"To apply brightness and color adjustments to projected images, the color transfer function (CTF) of the projector has to be known.

To ensure high accuracy, additional correction patterns are introduced to compensate for the influence of the dynamic background light caused by displaying the patterns itself. Furthermore, several permutations of the samples in the patterns are captured to address spatial variances of both the projector and the camera.

Traditional methods of aberration correction do not address artifacts introduced by a Fresnel lens in a systematic way and thus fail to deliver image quality acceptable for general-purpose color imaging. In our approach, the image is restored using three steps: first, by deblurring the base color channel, then by sharpening other two channels, and finally by applying color correction. Deblurring and sharpening remove significant chromatic aberration and are similar to the restoration technique used for images formed by simple refraction lenses. Color correction stage removes strong color shift caused by energy redistribution between diffraction orders of Fresnel lens. This post-capture processing was tested on real images formed by a four-step approximation of the Fresnel lens manufactured in our optics laboratory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fresnel lens imaging with post-capture image processing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301373","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301373.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fresnel lens imaging with post-capture image processing","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301373/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554158","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fresnel lens imaging with post-capture image processing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W26P05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092369S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301375,"authors":[{"name":"Leonidas Spinoulas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Leonidas","lastName":"Spinoulas","id":"37541130600"},{"name":"Kuan He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Kuan","lastName":"He","id":"37085608853"},{"name":"Oliver Cossairt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Cossairt","id":"37547766100"},{"name":"Aggelos Katsaggelos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Katsaggelos","id":"37085407015"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301375","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Image reconstruction","Spatial resolution","Compressed sensing","Registers","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","field programmable gate arrays","image capture","image resolution","image restoration","image sampling","video cameras","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video camera","video compressive sensing","on-chip programmable subsampling","temporal resolution","fixed bandwidth constraint","high frame-rates","electrooptic component","high speed spatio-temporal multiplexing","image capture","high speed video restoration","sparse regularization framework","all-digital temporal compressive video camera","programmable FPGA read out circuitry"]}],"abstract":"The maximum achievable frame-rate for a video camera is limited by the sensor's pixel readout rate. The same sensor may achieve either a slow frame-rate at full resolution (e.g., 60 fps at 4 Mpixel resolution) or a fast frame-rate at low resolution (e.g., 240 fps at 1 Mpixel resolution). Higher frame-rates are achieved using pixel readout modes (e.g., subsampling or binning) that sacrifice spatial for temporal resolution within a fixed bandwidth. A number of compressive video cameras have been introduced to overcome this fixed bandwidth constraint and achieve high frame-rates without sacrificing spatial resolution. These methods use electro-optic components (e.g., LCoS, DLPs, piezo actuators) to introduce high speed spatio-temporal multiplexing in captured images. Full resolution, high speed video is then restored by solving an undetermined system of equations using a sparse regularization framework. In this work, we introduce the first all-digital temporal compressive video camera that uses custom subsampling modes to achieve spatio-temporal multiplexing. Unlike previous compressive video cameras, ours requires no additional optical components, enabling it to be implemented in a compact package such as a mobile camera module. We demonstrate results using a TrueSense development kit with a 12 Mpixel sensor and programmable FPGA read out circuitry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video compressive sensing with on-chip programmable subsampling","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301375","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301375.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Video compressive sensing with on-chip programmable subsampling","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301375/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15554268","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video compressive sensing with on-chip programmable subsampling","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W26P07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059754S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301377,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Volpi","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Volpi","id":"37586980300"},{"name":"Vittorio Ferrari","affiliation":["University of Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37274804600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6759-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6758-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"7301377","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Labeling","Semantics","Remote sensing","Standards","Satellites","Materials requirements planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image segmentation","land cover","remote sensing","statistical analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic segmentation problem","local class interactions","land-cover mapping","remote sensing images","random fields models","structured support vector machines","SSVM","CRF models","urban high resolution satellite imagery"]}],"abstract":"Traditionally, land-cover mapping from remote sensing images is performed by classifying each atomic region in the image in isolation and by enforcing simple smoothing priors via random fields models as two independent steps.

To this end, we propose two priors, which are the normalized depth prior and the global-context surface orientation prior, and formulate them in the forms simple for computation. A two-stage RGB-D salient object detection framework is presented. It first integrates the region contrast, together with the background, depth, and orientation priors to achieve a saliency map. Then, a saliency restoration scheme is proposed, which integrates the PageRank algorithm for sampling high confident regions and recovers saliency for those ambiguous.

The proposed method is based on a combination of: (1) a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) exploiting the spatio-temporal coherency of acquired images and (2) learnt metrics dedicated to robust visual localization in complex scenes, such as streets. The HMM merges odometric measurements and visual similarities computed from specific (local) metrics learnt for each image of the database. To achieve this goal, we define some constraints so that the distance between a database image and a query image representing the same scene is smaller than the distance between this query image and other neighbor images of the database. Successful experiments, conducted using a freely available geo-referenced image database, reveal that the proposed method significantly improves results: the mean localization error is reduced from 12.9m to 3.9m over a 11km path.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301394","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops

simultaneously. The current state of the art approaches to this challenge either deal with only one of these two problems; for example FAB-MAP (viewpoint invariance) or SeqSLAM (appearance-invariance), or use extensive training within the test environment, an impractical requirement in many application scenarios. In this paper we significantly improve the viewpoint invariance of the SeqSLAM algorithm by using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to generate synthetic viewpoints. Our approach is different to other deep learning approaches in that it does not rely on the ability of the CNN network to learn invariant features, but only to produce\u201cgood enough\u201d depth images from day-time imagery only. We evaluate the system on a new multi-lane day-night car dataset specifically gathered to simultaneously test both appearance and viewpoint change. Results demonstrate that the use of synthetic viewpoints improves the maximum recall achieved at 100% precision by a factor of 2.2 and maximum recall by a factor of 2.7, enabling correct place recognition across multiple road lanes and significantly reducing the time between correct localizations.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301395","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293053/7301265/07301395.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence searching with deep-learnt depth for condition- and viewpoint-invariant route-based place recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sequence searching with deep-learnt depth for condition- and viewpoint-invariant route-based place recognition","conferenceDate":"7-12 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301395/","accessionNumber":"15554249","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301395/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence searching with deep-learnt depth for condition- and viewpoint-invariant route-based place recognition","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"W31P03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063739S","chronDate":"7-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293053","isNumber":"7301265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293053","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7301265","articleId":"7301395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7301410,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 D.

Nevertheless, these modulations require accurate time synchronization for correct operation.

Furthermore, exhaustive resources are required for traffic priorization because an individual FIFO is required for each priority level. The proposed FIFO incorporates efficient strategies for both frame dropping and traffic priorization. The approach is based on a small ring buffer for meta data of individual frames and a page table that maps the frames to pages in RAM where the data bits of the frame are stored. The FIFO has been implemented on a low-cost Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA. The solution requires little overhead for page table and ring buffer. Compared to an implementation with standard FIFOs that incorporates traffic priorization and frame dropping, RAM size is decreased from 44 kbytes to 2.7 kbytes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 20th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295717/7301399/07301585.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 20th Conference on Emerging Technologies & Factory Automation (ETFA)","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA based FIFO with efficient memory management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Real-time systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Buffer storage","Standards","Metadata","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","buffer storage","field programmable gate arrays","local area networks","random-access storage","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA based FIFO","efficient memory management","real-time Ethernet frame buffering","ring buffer overflow","traffic priorization","frame dropping","priority level","data bits","RAM","page table"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA based FIFO with efficient memory management","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301585/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15555862","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA based FIFO with efficient memory management","confLoc":"Luxembourg, Luxembourg","sourcePdf":"ETFA2015WiP303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06432S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295717","isNumber":"7301399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295717","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7301399","articleId":"7301585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301599,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitri Block","affiliation":["inIT -

In this work, effects of NBTI have been examined on a single PMOS transistor and further on SRAM operations. It has been observed that read Static Noise Margin (SNM) of the 6T SRAM cell degrades due to NBTI. To compensate this degradation different approaches have been reported previously. One of the approach is boosted power supply, but it leads to larger Read Power. The other approach is bit line voltage control, which reduces speed of read operation. Both of these approaches result in degradation of other performance parameters while improving SNM. In this paper, a new optimized method is proposed which is a hybrid model of both boosted power supply and bit line voltage control approach. First we develop an analytical model for SNM calculation as a function of change in threshold voltage (\u25b3V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tp</sub>\n) due to NBTI.

For any minor or major revision of an SoC, difficult decisions about its architecture have to be made at very early stages of the design cycle. System prototyping on FPGAs is an essential step in the SoC design flow for the verification of the hardware architecture. In this paper, we present a graph-grammar-based methodology to automate the FPGA prototyping for SoC performance monitoring and debugging analysis. Our work uses the IP-XACT description of vendor-specific hardware monitoring and debugging IPs for the target FPGA platform. Using graph-grammar principles the hardware monitors (HM) are automatically integrated into the host SoC architecture under consideration. Under the FPGA resource constraints, our tool splits the set of analysis tasks into multiple subsets, with each subset fitting into the available FPGA resources. The tool solves this as a classical bin packing problem. The tool then generates the SoC IP-XACT descriptions and the design descriptions for FPGA programming with integrated HMs for each new subset. The new SoCs are functionally equivalent to the original SoC.","doi":"10.1109/SMACD.2015.7301702","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design (SMACD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods and Applications to Circuit Design (SMACD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7297766/7301673/07301702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMACD.2015.7301702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301673","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automation of FPGA performance monitoring and debugging Using IP-XACT and graph-grammars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automation of FPGA performance monitoring and debugging Using IP-XACT and graph-grammars","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301702/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15582424","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7301702/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automation of FPGA performance monitoring and debugging Using IP-XACT and graph-grammars","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"T22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041323S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7297766","isNumber":"7301673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7297766","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7301673","articleId":"7301702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301709,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Besides the limited representativeness of facial models used for matching, the appearance of faces captured in videos varies due to changes in illumination, pose, scales, etc., and to camera inter-operability. A multi-classifier system is proposed in this paper for robust still-to-video face recognition (FR) based on multiple diverse face representations. An individual-specific ensemble of exemplar-SVMs (e-SVMs) classifiers is assigned to each target person, where each classifier is trained using a high-quality reference face still versus many lower-quality faces of non-target individuals captured in videos. Diverse face representations are generated from different patches isolated in facial images and face descriptors that are robust to various nuisance factors (e.g., illumination and pose) commonly encountered in surveillance environments. Discriminant feature subsets, training samples, and ensemble fusion functions are selected using faces of non-target individuals captured in videos of the scene. Experiments on videos from the Chokepoint dataset reveal that the proposed ensemble of e-SVMs outperforms state-of-the-art FR systems specialized for the single sample per person problem.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Feature extraction","Robustness","Support vector machines","Cameras","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image fusion","image matching","image representation","support vector machines","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exemplar-SVM","target face recognition","video surveillance","camera interoperability","multiclassifier system","still-to-video face recognition","multiple diverse face representation","individual-specific ensemble","e-SVM","image matching","face descriptor","ensemble fusion function","Chokepoint dataset","single sample per person"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301749","publicationTitle":"2015 12th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295687/7301715/07301749.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensembles of exemplar-SVMs for video face recognition from a single sample per person","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ensembles of exemplar-SVMs for video face recognition from a single sample per person","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301749/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301749/","accessionNumber":"15554563","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensembles of exemplar-SVMs for video face recognition from a single sample per person","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"pub028ISBCISBC3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057672S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295687","isNumber":"7301715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295687","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7301715","articleId":"7301749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7301787,"authors":[{"name":"Sadegh Mohammadi","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Sadegh","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37085483188"},{"name":"Hamed Kiani","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Kiani","id":"37646279700"},{"name":"Alessandro Perina","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Perina","id":"37397765700"},{"name":"Vittorio Murino","affiliation":["Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision Department (PAVIS), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Murino","id":"37085369469"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7632-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7631-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7301787","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Acceleration","Standards","Motion pictures","Video sequences","Trajectory","Dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image sequences","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["violence detection","video descriptor","substantial derivative","temporal motion information","spatio-temporal characteristic","optic flow","standard bag-of-word procedure","video-survelliance sequences","Youtube"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel video descriptor based on substantial derivative, an important concept in fluid mechanics, that captures the rate of change of a fluid property as it travels through a velocity field. Unlike standard approaches that only use temporal motion information, our descriptor exploits the spatio-temporal characteristic of substantial derivative. In particular, the spatial and temporal motion patterns are captured by respectively the convective and local accelerations. After estimating the convective and local field from the optic flow, we followed the standard bag-of-word procedure for each motion pattern separately, and we concatenated the two resulting histograms to form the final descriptor. We extensively evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method on five benchmarks, including three standard datasets (Violence in Movies, Violence In Crowd, and BEHAVE), and two new video-survelliance sequences downloaded from Youtube. Our experiments show how the proposed approach sets the new state-of-the-art on all benchmarks and how the structural information captured by convective acceleration is essential to detect violent episodes in crowded scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301787","publicationTitle":"2015 12th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance (AVSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295687/7301715/07301787.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2015.7301787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7301715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Violence detection in crowded scenes using substantial derivative","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301787/","displayDocTitle":"Violence detection in crowded scenes using substantial derivative","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15582343","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7301787/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Violence detection in crowded scenes using substantial derivative","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"pub066OralSession4Paper119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05117S","chronDate":"25-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295687","isNumber":"7301715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295687","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7301715","articleId":"7301787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7301804,"authors":[{"name":"Tom\u00e1s Mantec\u00f3n","affiliation":["Grupo de Tratamiento de Imagenes, UPM, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Tom\u00e1s","lastName":"Mantec\u00f3n","id":"38549149500"},{"name":"Ana Mantec\u00f3n","affiliation":["Grupo de Tratamiento de Imagenes, UPM, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Mantec\u00f3n","id":"37085547828"},{"name":"Carlos R. del-Blanco","affiliation":["Grupo de Tratamiento de Imagenes, UPM, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos R.","lastName":"del-Blanco","id":"37601354800"},{"name":"Fernando Jaureguizar","affiliation":["Grupo de Tratamiento de Imagenes, UPM, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Jaureguizar","id":"37352642000"},{"name":"Narciso Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Narciso","lastName":"Garc\u00eda"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7632-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7631-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7301804","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Gesture recognition","Compressed sensing","Support vector machines","Assistive technology","Sparse matrices","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data reduction","feature extraction","human computer interaction","interactive devices","natural language processing","sign language recognition","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand gesture-based recognition system","gesture-based human-computer interaction","compressive sensing reduction scheme","depth feature descriptor","finger-spelling recognition","American sign language","Kinect 2 sensor","dimensionality reduction","support vector machine based classification"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a hand gesture-based recognition system is presented with the aim of recognizing finger-spelling using the American Sign Language.

The system is composed by three steps: 1) depth-based feature descriptor computation that robustly characterizes the hand gesture; 2) Compressive Sensing based dimensionality reduction that shortens the previous highly discriminative but also large feature vector with almost no information lost; and 3) Support Vector Machine based classification that recognizes the performed hand gestures.

It is shown that for ideal distributed Raman amplification (IDRA), the Wiener process model is suitable for the non-linear phase noise due to cross phase modulation from neighboring channels. Based on this model, a phase noise tracking algorithm is presented. We approximate the distribution of the phase noise at each time instant by a mixture of Tikhonov distributions, and derive a closed form expression for the posterior probabilities of the input symbols. This reduces the complexity dramatically compared to previous trellis-based approaches, which require numerical integration. Further, the proposed method performs very well in low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where standard decision directed (DD) methods, especially for high-order modulation, fail. The proposed algorithm does not rely on averaging, and therefore does not experience high error floors at high SNR in severe phase noise scenarios. The laser linewidth (LLW) tolerance is thereby increased for the entire SNR region compared to previous DD methods. In IDRA WDM links, the algorithm is shown to effectively combat the combined effect of both laser phase noise and non-linear phase noise, which cannot be neglected in such scenarios. In a more practical lumped amplification scheme, we show near-optimal performance for 16 QAM, 64 QAM, and 256 QAM with LLW up to 100 kHz, and reasonable performance for LLW of 1 MHz for 16 QAM and 64 QAM, at the moderate received SNR region. The performance in these cases is close to the information rate achieved by the above mentioned trellis processing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2493202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300504","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7300504/07301998.pdf","endPage":"4984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Tracking of Laser and Nonlinear Phase Noise in WDM Optical Fiber Systems","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2493202","startPage":"4975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7301998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Tracking of Laser and Nonlinear Phase Noise in WDM Optical Fiber Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7301998/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15645285","publicationDate":"1 Dec.1, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7301998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"23","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Tracking of Laser and Nonlinear Phase Noise in WDM Optical Fiber Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-yankov-2493202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088745S","chronDate":"Dec.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7300504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7300504","articleId":"7301998","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7302003,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqian Shen","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenqian","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085385904"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"},{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37277951300"},{"name":"Shahid Mumtaz","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Mumtaz","id":"37948237400"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7302003","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Downlink","Uplink","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","singular value decomposition","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint CSIT acquisition scheme","FDD massive multiple-input multiple-output system","channel state information at the transmitter","frequency-division duplexing massive MIMO channel matrix","overwhelming overhead reduction","downlink channel training","uplink channel feedback","base station","joint CSIT recovery problem","low-rank matrix completion problem","singular value projection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","FDD","CSIT","low-rank matrix completion"]},{"kwd":["Massive MIMO","FDD","CSIT","low-rank matrix completion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302003","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07302003.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2492960","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2492960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint CSIT Acquisition Based on Low-Rank Matrix Completion for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","abstract":"Channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is essential for frequency-division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems, but conventional solutions involve overwhelming overhead both for downlink channel training and uplink channel feedback. In this letter, we propose a joint CSIT acquisition scheme to reduce the overhead. Particularly, unlike conventional schemes where each user individually estimates its own channel and then feed it back to the base station (BS), we propose that all scheduled users directly feed back the pilot observation to the BS, and then joint CSIT recovery can be realized at the BS. We further formulate the joint CSIT recovery problem as a low-rank matrix completion problem by utilizing the low-rank property of the massive MIMO channel matrix, which is caused by the correlation among users. Finally, we propose a hybrid low-rank matrix completion algorithm based on the singular value projection to solve this problem. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide accurate CSIT with lower overhead than conventional schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302003/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"19","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15661666","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7302003/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint CSIT Acquisition Based on Low-Rank Matrix Completion for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571270 and 61201185"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint CSIT Acquisition Based on Low-Rank Matrix Completion for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-dai-2492960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093642S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"7302003","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7302006,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Quevedo-Teruel","affiliation":["Department of Electromagnetic Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Quevedo-Teruel","id":"38273597200"},{"name":"Mahsa Ebrahimpouri","affiliation":["Department of Electromagnetic Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Ebrahimpouri","id":"37085646644"},{"name":"Malcolm Ng Mou Kehn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Malcolm","lastName":"Ng Mou Kehn","id":"37085382278"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7302006","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2959},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Refractive index","Nails","Dispersion","Surface waves","Antennas","Optical surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directive antennas","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrawideband metasurface planar lenses","off-shifted opposite layers","directive antennas","refractive index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Luneburg lens","metasurfaces","parallel-plate waveguide","ultrawideband lens"]}],"abstract":"Metasurfaces have demonstrated to be a low-cost solution for the development of directive antennas at high frequency. One of the opportunities of metasurfaces is the possibility to produce planar lenses. However, these lenses usually present a narrow band of operation. This limitation on bandwidth is more restrictive when the required range of refractive index is high. Here, we present a novel implementation of metasurfaces with low dispersion that can be employed for the design of ultrawideband planar lenses. The implementation consists of two mirrored metasurfaces that are displaced exactly a half unit cell. This displacement produces two effects: It increases the equivalent refractive index of the fundamental mode and flattens its frequency dependence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband Metasurface Lenses Based on Off-Shifted Opposite Layers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2492678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07302006.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2492678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Ultrawideband Metasurface Lenses Based on Off-Shifted Opposite Layers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/7302006/","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"15813572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government","grantNumber":"TEC2013-44019-R"},{"fundingName":"Swedish STINT Postdoctoral Transition","grantNumber":"PT2014-5813"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"103-2221-E-009-027"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawideband Metasurface Lenses Based on Off-Shifted Opposite Layers","sourcePdf":"lawp-quevedoteruel-2492678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043282S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7302006","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302014,"authors":[{"name":"Sergejs Makovejs","affiliation":["Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sergejs Makovejs received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\n telecommunications from Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree\n in electronic and electrical engineering from University College London, London, U.K. in 2011.","He is currently at Corning Limited, Flintshire, U.K. in Market and Technology Development team of Optical\n Communications division.

The objectives considered include both the interpretability and control performance of the FLS. It is assumed that no off-line training data are available in advance, and the rule base is initially empty. All rules are generated through an online clustering and fuzzy set merging (OCFM) algorithm using data generated online during the FLS evaluation process. The OCFM builds a reference rule base that flexibly partitions the input space with distinguishable fuzzy sets (FSs). Based on the reference rule base, a new multiobjective front-guided continuous ant-colony optimization (MO-FCACO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the FLS structure and parameters. In addition to the objective functions defined to evaluate the FLS control performance, a transparency-oriented objective function is defined with constraints imposed on the FS parameters to obtain an interpretable FLS with transparent FSs. The MO-FCACO solves the constrained multiobjective optimization problem by optimizing all of the free parameters in an FLS through ant-path selection, sampling operation, and front-guided optimization processes. The multiobjective FLS design approach is applied to control the orientation and moving speed of a mobile robot in performing the wall-following task. Optimization performance of the MO-FCACO is verified through comparisons with various multiobjective population-based optimization algorithms.

A few researches concentrate the optimal design on feature representation and metric learning. However, traditionally used features of single-type, e.g., image gradient orientations (IGOs), are deficient to characterize the complete variations in robust and discriminant subspace learning. Meanwhile, discontinuity in edge alignment and feature match are not been carefully treated in the literature. In this paper, local order constrained IGOs are exploited to generate robust features. As the difference-based filters explicitly consider the local contrasts within neighboring pixel points, the proposed features enhance the local textures and the order-based coding ability, thus discover intrinsic structure of facial images further. The multimodal features are automatically fused in the most discriminant subspace. The utilization of adaptive interaction function suppresses outliers in each dimension for robust similarity measurement and discriminant analysis. The sparsity-driven regression model is modified to adapt the classification issue of the compact feature representation. Extensive experiments are conducted by using some benchmark face data sets, e.g., of controlled and uncontrolled environments, to evaluate our new algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2484356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7586170/07302030.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2484356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7586170","startPage":"2656","endPage":"2669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Local Gradient Order Features and Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Local Gradient Order Features and Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378829","pubMedId":"26513817","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7302030/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11171354, 61203248, 61375033 and 61572536"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"SRFDP-20120171120007 and 20120171110016"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"S2013020012796"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"13lgpy26"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Local Gradient Order Features and Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-dai-2484356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127804S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7586170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7586170","articleId":"7302030","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302041,"authors":[{"name":"Jyotsna Bahl","affiliation":["Center for Research in Nanotechnology and Science, IIT Bombay, Powai, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7331113/7302041/bahl-2486142-small.gif","p":["Jyotsna Bahl received the M.Tech. degree in physics with a minor in solid-state materials from IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India, in 2008.

However, due to the inherent symmetry in such a structure, the contribution due to thermoelectric effects on programming currents is minimal. In this paper, we propose a hybrid PCM structure, which incorporates a twofold asymmetry specifically aimed to favorably enhance the thermoelectric effects. The first asymmetry is introduced via an interface layer of low thermal conductivity and high negative Seebeck coefficient, such as polycrystalline SiGe, between the bottom electrode contact and the active region comprising the phase-change material. This results in an enhanced Peltier heating of the active material. The second one is introduced structurally via a taper that results in an angle-dependent Thomson heating within the active region. Various device geometries are analyzed using 2-D-axis-symmetric simulations to predict the effect on programming currents as well as for different thicknesses of the interface layer. A programming current reduction of up to 60% is predicted for specific cell geometries. Remarkably, we find that due to an interplay of Thomson cooling in the electrode and the asymmetric heating profile inside the active region, the predicted programming current reduction is resilient to fabrication variability.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2486142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7331113/07302041.pdf","startPage":"4015","endPage":"4021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2486142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programming Current Reduction via Enhanced Asymmetry-Induced Thermoelectric Effects in Vertical Nanopillar Phase-Change Memory Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Programming Current Reduction via Enhanced Asymmetry-Induced Thermoelectric Effects in Vertical Nanopillar Phase-Change Memory Cells","volume":"62","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602662","htmlLink":"/document/7302041/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IIT Bombay SEED","grantNumber":"12IRCCSG013"},{"fundingName":"Center of Automotive Energy and Materials, International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy & New Materials, IIT Madras Research Park"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programming Current Reduction via Enhanced Asymmetry-Induced Thermoelectric Effects in Vertical Nanopillar Phase-Change Memory Cells","sourcePdf":"ted-muralidharan-2486142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100151S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7331113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7331113","articleId":"7302041","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302045,"authors":[{"name":"He Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085361769"},{"name":"Sunghwan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38541389700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7302045","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":501},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we proposed a bit-level soft (BLS) run-length limited (RLL) decoding algorithm for visible light communication (VLC). Conventional RLL encoding is only used for dimming control, and the lack of effective RLL decoding is a long-standing issue in VLC systems. Therefore, an RLL decoding method that utilizes soft information from the channel to produce BLS output is proposed for enhancing the performance of the system. The BLS RLL decoder is conjugated with a Reed-Solomon decoder that can efficiently utilize bit-level information from RLL decoding output. The simulation results show that the bit error rate performance of our proposed RLL decoding provides a significant gain over that of the conventional RLL decoding and compares favorably with that of the referenced RLL decoding methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Gain","Visible light communication","Encoding","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","optical communication equipment","runlength codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-level soft run length limited decoding algorithm","visible light communication","Reed-Solomon decoder","bit error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bit-level soft (BLS) decoding","run-length limited (RLL) codes","visible light communication (VLC)"]},{"kwd":["Bit-level soft (BLS) decoding","run-length limited (RLL) codes","visible light communication (VLC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302045","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2015.2493203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7360965/07302045.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2015.2493203","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Level Soft Run-Length Limited Decoding Algorithm for Visible Light Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Level Soft Run-Length Limited Decoding Algorithm for Visible Light Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302045/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","volume":"28","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7302045/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15669248","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A1004521"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Level Soft Run-Length Limited Decoding Algorithm for Visible Light Communication","sourcePdf":"lpt-kim-2493203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037479S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"7360965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7360965","articleId":"7302045","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7302046,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Paolini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering G.

The scheme is named coded slotted ALOHA. A bipartite graph representation of the SIC process, resembling iterative decoding of generalized low-density parity-check codes over the erasure channel, is exploited to optimize the selection probabilities of the component erasure correcting codes through a density evolution analysis. The capacity (in packets per slot) of the scheme is then analyzed in the context of the collision channel without feedback. Moreover, a capacity bound is developed, and component code distributions tightly approaching the bound are derived.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2492579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7331248/07302046.pdf","startPage":"6815","endPage":"6832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2492579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Graph-Based Method for Uncoordinated Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Graph-Based Method for Uncoordinated Multiple Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302046/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15601918","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302046/","volume":"61","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research through the Research Projects of Significant National Interest PRIN 2011 GRETA"},{"fundingName":"Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst through DLR-DAAD Fellowship no. 156"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Slotted ALOHA: A Graph-Based Method for Uncoordinated Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"tit-paolini-2492579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141929S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7331248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"7331248","articleId":"7302046","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7302053,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwu Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7302053/huang-2493448-small.gif","p":["Zhiwu Huang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in computer software and theory from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2015.","He has been a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Computer Vision Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland, since 2015.

Real-world video-based face recognition applications require techniques for three distinct scenarios: 1) Videoto-Still (V2S); 2) Still-to-Video (S2V); and 3) Video-to-Video (V2V), respectively, taking video or still image as query or target. To the best of our knowledge, few datasets and evaluation protocols have benchmarked for all the three scenarios. In order to facilitate the study of this specific topic, this paper contributes a benchmarking and comparative study based on a newly collected still/video face database, named COX\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n Face DB. Specifically, we make three contributions. First, we collect and release a largescale still/video face database to simulate video surveillance with three different video-based face recognition scenarios (i.e., V2S, S2V, and V2V). Second, for benchmarking the three scenarios designed on our database, we review and experimentally compare a number of existing set-based methods. Third, we further propose a novel Point-to-Set Correlation Learning (PSCL) method, and experimentally show that it can be used as a promising baseline method for V2S/S2V face recognition on COX Face DB. Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that video-based face recognition needs more efforts, and our COX Face DB is a good benchmark database for evaluation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Benchmark and Comparative Study of Video-Based Face Recognition on COX Face Database","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2493448","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07302053.pdf","startPage":"5967","endPage":"5981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2493448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Benchmark and Comparative Study of Video-Based Face Recognition on COX Face Database","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7302053/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15565762","pubMedId":"26513790","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2015CB351802"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61390511, 61173065, 61222211 and 61379083"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Benchmark and Comparative Study of Video-Based Face Recognition on COX Face Database","sourcePdf":"tip-shan-2493448-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15377S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7302053","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7302057,"authors":[{"name":"Kyriakos G.

The adaptive control nature of the algorithm requires a persistence of excitation condition to be a priori validated, but this can be relaxed using previously stored data concurrently with current data in the update of the critic NN. A robustifying control term is added to the controller to eliminate the effect of residual errors, leading to the asymptotically stability of the closed-loop system.

This paper considers the problem of secure communication in the multiuser downlink with a passive eavesdropper (Eve), whose channel state information (CSI) is unavailable. The transmitter simultaneously transmits concurrent information signals to the users and artificial noise (AN) to Eve. We first assume that all users' CSI is perfectly known by the transmitter and derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic secrecy sum rate (SSR) in the large-system limit. We then use it as an objective function to optimize the power allocation between information signals and the AN. It shows that more power needs to be used for AN when Eve has more antennas and when the system serves fewer users. We also extend the analysis to the imperfect-CSI scenario, where the SSR saturates at high transmit power, and it is better to create more AN than to increase the signal strength when the channel estimation error is large. We derive a scale law of feedback bits (for frequency-division duplexing (FDD) systems) to maintain a constant rate offset compared with the perfect-CSI case and the optimal length of training sequence (for time-division duplexing (TDD) systems) to maximize the effective SSR. It shows that more feedback bits and longer training sequences are required to deal with the eavesdropping problem. Closed-form expressions derived in this paper can reduce the complexity of system analysis and design.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2493178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2493178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7569115/07302060.pdf","startPage":"7036","endPage":"7050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-System Analysis of Artificial-Noise-Assisted Communication in the Multiuser Downlink: Ergodic Secrecy Sum Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Large-System Analysis of Artificial-Noise-Assisted Communication in the Multiuser Downlink: Ergodic Secrecy Sum Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","volume":"65","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302060/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16316593","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302060/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholar of China","grantNumber":"61325006"},{"fundingName":"National High-tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-System Analysis of Artificial-Noise-Assisted Communication in the Multiuser Downlink: Ergodic Secrecy Sum Rate and Optimal Power Allocation","sourcePdf":"tvt-tao-2493178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165331S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7302060","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7302061,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Gao","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7398213/7302061/bigao-2492924-small.gif","p":["Bin Gao (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree in communications and signal processing from Southwest Jiao Tong University, Chengdu, China, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communications and signal processing and the Ph.D. degree in research of blind source separation and statistic signal processing from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","From 2011 to 2013, he worked as a Research Associate with Newcastle University.

The proposed method is automatic and does not require manual selection of specific frequencies for defect diagnostics. The core of the method is a computational intelligent machine learning algorithm based on sparse non-negative matrix factorization. An internal functionality is built into the machine learning algorithm to adaptively learn and control the sparsity of the factorization, and to render better accuracy in detecting defects. This is achieved by using Bayesian statistics methodology. The proposed method is demonstrated on automatic detection of defect in metals. In addition, we show that the extraction of the spectrum signature corresponding to the defect is significantly more efficient with the proposed optimal sparsity, which subsequently led to better detection performance. Experimental tests and comparisons with other sparse factorization methods have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7398213/07302061.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2492924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2492924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Diagnostic and Monitoring of Defects Using Waveguide Imaging With Adaptive Sparse Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Apertures","Transmission line matrix methods","Surface waves","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix decomposition","process monitoring","statistics","waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised defect diagnostic","unsupervised defect monitoring","waveguide imaging","adaptive sparse representation","intelligent machine learning algorithm","sparse non-negative matrix factorization","Bayesian statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diagnosis and monitoring","instrumentation","waveguide imaging","machine learning","signal processing and analysis","computational intelligence"]},{"kwd":["Computational intelligence","diagnosis and monitoring","instrumentation","machine learning","signal processing and analysis","waveguide imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Diagnostic and Monitoring of Defects Using Waveguide Imaging With Adaptive Sparse Representation","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7302061/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15755371","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51377015 and 61401071"},{"fundingName":"NSAF","grantNumber":"U1430115"},{"fundingName":"FP7 Health Monitoring of Offshore Wind Farms (HERMOW IRSES)","grantNumber":"269202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"136413"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province, China","grantNumber":"2013HH0059"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2014J068"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Diagnostic and Monitoring of Defects Using Waveguide Imaging With Adaptive Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"tii-woo-2492924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089243S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7398213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7398213","articleId":"7302061","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302062,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyao Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7302062/yshen-2492967-small.gif","p":["Yanyao Shen received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

However, few of them have considered the downlink transmission for multiple concurrent devices from an energy efficiency perspective. In this paper, we focus on a D2D-assisted cellular communication in video stream sharing scenario. Two energy saving solutions for downlink transmission are proposed with constraint on D2D cluster's energy consumption. We take peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) as the measurement for video quality and consider both the downlink transmission energy and reception energy. In particular, we propose the D2D cluster formation approach and the D2D caching performance both for the purpose of energy saving, with distributed merge-and-split algorithm adopted from the perspective of coalition game theory and a relaxation factor defined to give constraints on total energy consumption for each cluster. Both D2D cluster and D2D caching approaches are effective for energy saving for the BS combined with all user devices; however, D2D cluster brings an unfairness problem between the cluster head and other cluster nodes. Therefore, we compare the two approaches on energy saving performance as well as fairness measurement.

In particular, we analyze the performance gains, in terms of EC and average transmitted power, attributed to leveraging the primary user (PU) feedback overheard at the SU, at no additional complexity or hardware cost. We characterize the EC performance improvement for the SU, in the presence of a feedback-based sensing scheme, under the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) interference and collision models. Toward this objective, we develop a Markov chain model for feedback-based sensing to compare the performance of a two-link network, a single secondary link, and a primary network abstracted to a single primary link, with and without primary-feedback exploitation. We prove that exploiting the primary feedback at the secondary transmitter improves the EC of the SU under the SINR interference model. On the other hand, interestingly, exploiting the PU feedback messages does not enhance the EC of the SU under the collision model. Nevertheless, exploiting the PU feedback reduces the SU average transmitted power under the two aforementioned models. Finally, we present numerical results, for plausible scenarios, that support our analytical findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","volume":"65","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"16306033","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302072/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effective Capacity of Delay-Constrained Cognitive Radio Links Exploiting Primary Feedback","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"NPRP 4-1034-2-385 and NPRP 09-1168-2-455"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Capacity of Delay-Constrained Cognitive Radio Links Exploiting Primary Feedback","sourcePdf":"tvt-anwar-2493040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091379S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7569115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7569115","articleId":"7302072","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7302073,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanshan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China","State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7605560/7302073/wang-2485259-small.gif","p":["Zhanshan Wang (M\u201909) received the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from Liaoning Shihua University, Fushun, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006.","He has been a Professor with Northeastern University since 2010.

First, an input-output discrete-time quasi-sliding mode control with inserted digital integrator, which additionally reduces chattering, is described. Due to the presence of various nonlinearities and uncertainties, the model of the controlled object cannot be described adequately enough. These imperfections in modeling cause a modeling error, resulting in rather poor system performances. In order to increase the steady-state accuracy, an estimated value of the modeling error in the next sampling period is implemented into the control law. For this purpose, we propose two improved structures of the neural networks by implementing the generalized quasi-orthogonal functions of Legendre type. These functions have already been proven as an effective tool for the signal approximation, as well as for modeling, identification, analysis, synthesis, and simulation of dynamical systems. Finally, the proposed method is verified through digital simulations and real-time experiments on an anti-lock braking system as a representative of the considered class of mechatronic systems, in a laboratory environment. A detailed analysis of the obtained results confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of better steady-state performances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15823020","volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7302076/","publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Sliding Mode Control With Orthogonal Endocrine Neural Network-Based Estimator Applied in Anti-Lock Braking System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia","grantNumber":"TR 35005 and III 44006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Sliding Mode Control With Orthogonal Endocrine Neural Network-Based Estimator Applied in Anti-Lock Braking System","sourcePdf":"tmech-peric-2492682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103382S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7422867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7422867","articleId":"7302076","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7302077,"authors":[{"name":"Chinthaka Dinesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka"],"bio":{"p":["Chinthaka Dinesh (S\u201915) received the B.Sc.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, in 2012.","He is currently a Temporary Lecturer with the University of Peradeniya.

This method utilizes the Karhunen Lo\u00e9ve expansion to breakdown the active power signal into subspace components (SCs) so as to construct a unique information rich appliance signature. Unlike existing NILM techniques that rely on multiple measurements at high sampling rates, this method works effectively with a single active power measurement taken at a low sampling rate. After constructing the signature data base, SC level power conditions were introduced to reduce the number of possible appliance combinations prior to applying the maximum a posteriori estimation. Then, an appliances matching algorithm was presented to identify the turned-on appliance combination in a given time window. After identifying the turned-on appliance combination, an energy estimation algorithm was introduced to disaggregate the energy contribution of each individual appliance in that combination. The proposed NILM method was validated by using two public databases: 1) tracebase; and 2) reference energy disaggregation data set. The presented results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to accurately identify and disaggregate individual energy contributions of turned-on appliance combinations in real households.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2484258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7593445/07302077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2484258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593445","startPage":"2781","endPage":"2792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Residential Appliance Identification Based on Spectral Information of Low Frequency Smart Meter Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Residential Appliance Identification Based on Spectral Information of Low Frequency Smart Meter Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16396334","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7302077/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Residential Appliance Identification Based on Spectral Information of Low Frequency Smart Meter Measurements","sourcePdf":"tsg-dinesh-2484258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083681S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7593445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7593445","articleId":"7302077","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302082,"authors":[{"name":"Inna Vaisband","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester, River Campus, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7302082/vaisb-small.gif","p":["Inna Vaisband, Member, IEEE (M\u201912) received the bachelor's\n degree in computer engineering and the master's degree in electrical engineering from the Technion-Israel\n Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering\n from the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA, in 2015.","She is currently a post-doctoral researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Rochester,\n Rochester.

To provide high quality power, the on-chip power needs to be regulated with ultrasmall locally distributed power efficient converters. While the quality of the power supply can be efficiently addressed with distributed on-chip power supplies, the stability of these parallel connected voltage regulators is a primary concern. A passivity-based stability criterion is proposed for maintaining a stable power delivery system composed of multiple regulators. To evaluate the proposed approach, a fully integrated power delivery system with distributed on-chip low-dropout (LDO) regulators has been fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process. The experimental results of a distributed power delivery system composed of six on-chip LDO regulators satisfy this stability criterion, yielding a stable system response within -25\u00b0C to 125\u00b0C, 10% voltage variations, and 50% to 200% load sharing variations.

Thanks to high water content of human skin, its dielectric response to terahertz radiation can be described by the double Debye model which uses five parameters to fit experimental data. Skin tumors typically have a higher water content than normal tissues do, and this should be apparent in the parameters. The goal of this paper is to apply statistical methods to these parameters to test their power to differentiate skin cancer from normal tissue. Based on the prediction accuracy estimated using a cross-validation method, we found the best classifier was the static permittivity at low frequency (\u03b5\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n). By combining the most relevant parameters, we obtained a classification accuracy of 95.7%, confirming the classification capability of the parameters, thereby supporting their application to improve terahertz imaging for the purpose of skin cancer delineation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503871/7334623/07302086.pdf","startPage":"990","endPage":"998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","doi":"10.1109/TTHZ.2015.2485208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTHZ.2015.2485208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7334623","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Potential of the Double Debye Parameters to Discriminate Between Basal Cell Carcinoma and Normal Skin","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skin","Permittivity","Correlation","Tumors","Statistical analysis","Support vector machines","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological effects of microwaves","biological tissues","biomedical imaging","cancer","cellular effects of radiation","skin","statistical analysis","terahertz wave imaging","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double Debye parameters","basal cell carcinoma","terahertz imaging","Mohs micrographic surgery","tumor margin detection","human skin","dielectric response","terahertz radiation","double Debye model","skin tumors","statistical methods","cross-validation method","skin cancer delineation","static permittivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","dielectric properties","optimization","statistical analysis","support vector machine","terahertz (THz)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"The Potential of the Double Debye Parameters to Discriminate Between Basal Cell Carcinoma and Normal Skin","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7302086/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615674","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Potential of the Double Debye Parameters to Discriminate Between Basal Cell Carcinoma and Normal Skin","sourcePdf":"tthz-hoang-2485208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100241S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"7334623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7334623","articleId":"7302086","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302087,"authors":[{"name":"David Applegate","affiliation":["Algorithms and Optimization Research, AT&T Labs\u2014Research, Florham Park, New Jersey, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7544544/7302087/7302087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Applegate received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, in 1991.","He then spent 4 years as a Member of Technical Staff with AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA, and 4 years as an Associate Professor with Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, before joining AT&T Labs.

With the rapid increase in library sizes, it will soon become infeasible to replicate the entire library at each office. We present an approach for intelligent content placement that scales to large library sizes (e.g., 100 Ks of videos). We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program (MIP) that takes into account constraints such as disk space, link bandwidth, and content popularity. To overcome the challenges of scale, we employ a Lagrangian relaxation-based decomposition technique combined with integer rounding. Our technique finds a near-optimal solution (e.g., within 1%-2%) with orders of magnitude speedup relative to solving even the linear programming (LP) relaxation via standard software. We also present simple strategies to address practical issues such as popularity estimation, content updates, short-term popularity fluctuation, and frequency of placement updates. Using traces from an operational system, we show that our approach significantly outperforms simpler placement strategies. For instance, our MIP-based solution can serve all requests using only half the link bandwidth used by least recently used (LRU) or least frequently used (LFU) cache replacement policies. We also investigate the tradeoff between disk space and network bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7544544/07302087.pdf","startPage":"2114","endPage":"2127","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2461599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2461599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Content Placement for a Large-Scale VoD System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Bandwidth","Libraries","Servers","Linear programming","IEEE transactions","IPTV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","integer programming","IPTV","linear programming","multimedia computing","video databases","video on demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal content placement","video-on-demand","VoD system","IPTV service providers","metropolitan office","intelligent content placement","mixed integer program","MIP","disk space","link bandwidth","content popularity","Lagrangian relaxation-based decomposition technique","integer rounding","linear programming relaxation","LP relaxation","popularity estimation","short-term popularity fluctuation","operational system","least recently used cache replacement policies","LRU cache replacement policies","least frequently used cache replacement policies","LFU cache replacement policies","network bandwidth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Content placement","integer programming","video on demand"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Content Placement for a Large-Scale VoD System","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7302087/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231790","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimal Content Placement for a Large-Scale VoD System","sourcePdf":"tnet-lee-2461599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106572S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7302087","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302089,"authors":[{"name":"Shravan Garlapati","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7590206/7302089/7302089-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shravan Garlapati is currently working as a Senior Wireless Modem Design Engineer at Qualcomm Technologies Inc, San Diego, CA.","He received the Ph.D. in computer engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2014.

Also, we propose SMAC protocol, which changes its mode of operation based on the type of the data being collected to reduce the data collection latency and control overhead when compared to 3G cellular CDMA2000 MAC. The reduction in the data collection latency and control overhead aids in increasing the number of smart meters served by a base station within the periodic data collection interval, which further reduces the number of base stations needed by a utility or reduces the bandwidth needed to collect data from all the smart meters. The reduction in the number of base stations and/or the reduction in the data transmission bandwidth reduces the CAPital EXpenditure (CAPEX) and OPerational EXpenditure (OPEX) of the AMI network.

In addition, we take into account the effect of nonlinear distortion caused by two non-linearity devices that are Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) and photodetector. Numerical results show that the effect of noise can be effectively mitigated by increasing the optical transmitted power or the modulation index of MZM. However, when modulation index is larger than a specific value, the nonlinear distortion is likely dominant over the noise, which results in degradation of the system performance.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can send multiple high speed signals by using orthogonal carrier frequencies. Recently, studies have focused on the optimal OFDM technique for optical wireless systems. When using OFDM, one important issue is the determination of the cyclic prefix and its removal from the frame before the receiver detects signals. In this paper, we propose a new auto synchronization technique for OFDM systems. This technique enables the removal of the cyclic prefix in any sample of the OFDM frame and valid only for unipolar MPAM signals. It is a candidate for 2 or 4-PAM OFDM. The results of mathematical analysis and simulations show that it can be used for optical wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/NICS.2015.7302182","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7297714/7302153/07302182.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NICS.2015.7302182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new auto synchronization technique of unipolar MPAM signals for OFDM-based optical wireless communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302182/","displayDocTitle":"A new auto synchronization technique of unipolar MPAM signals for OFDM-based optical wireless communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556353","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302182/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new auto synchronization technique of unipolar MPAM signals for OFDM-based optical wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p158dang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066427S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7297714","isNumber":"7302153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7297714","xplore-issue":"7302153","articleId":"7302182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302209,"authors":[{"name":"Tien Hoa Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, HUST, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Tien Hoa","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38184430800"},{"name":"Van Tien Pham","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, HUST, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Van Tien","lastName":"Pham","id":"37087599788"},{"name":"Van Duc Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, HUST, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Van Duc","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086353131"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6640-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6639-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6638-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302209","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302209","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Transceivers","OFDM","Cognitive radio","Resource management","Transmitters","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","Long Term Evolution","optimisation","power control","radiofrequency interference","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","multibands assignment","cognitive radio transceiver","LTE scenario","CR system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique","OFDM","CR Tx-Rx","temporal free spectrum","primary user system","multiband allocation","radio frequency front-end","low complexity bands assignment","total interference allocation","total sum-rate maximization problem","CR downlink capacity","power constraint","CR intranetwork interference","synchronization errors","mutual user interference","MUI","inter user interference","IUI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Multi-bands","Multi-Users","Power Allocation","Sub-carrier Assignment","LTE-A","Optimization with constraints"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NICS.2015.7302209","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7297714/7302153/07302209.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NICS.2015.7302209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power control and multi-bands assignment for Cognitive Radio in LTE scenario","abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of multi-bands assignment and power control of a CR system which includes K of Cognitive Radio transceiver (CR Tx-Rx) using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique. They coexist side by side with L bands of a primary user system (PU). Each CR Tx-Rx is assigned to a portion of temporal free spectrum. In order to exploit this temporal free spectrum effectively, a multi-band allocation is permitted, where many pairs of CR Tx-Rx have their own radio frequency (RF) front-end. Firstly, we propose an efficient low complexity bands assignment to each pair of CR. The Idea is to allocate the total interference from PU to every CR Rx equally. After the frequency bands for each pair of CR Tx-Rx have been operated, we solve the total sum-rate maximization problem of CR downlink capacity with interference and power constraints concerning CR intra-network interference. However, the problem of multi-band allocation technique is the vulnerability to synchronization errors which leads to a loss of orthogonality. In this study, we take not only the conventional mutual user interference (MUI) between PU and CR but also inter user interference (IUI) between CR users into account. The results show that the CR transmission capacity depends critically on bands assignment and power allocation approaches. These effects are investigated in LTE-A scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302209/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15556394","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302209/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power control and multi-bands assignment for Cognitive Radio in LTE scenario","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power control and multi-bands assignment for Cognitive Radio in LTE scenario","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p289hoa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057881S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7297714","isNumber":"7302153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7297714","xplore-issue":"7302153","articleId":"7302209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302211,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen A.

The correlated systems generally have additive colored Gaussian noise (ACGN) at receive terminals and correlated data symbols at the source. By designing the optimal precoder in closed-form to cope with channel correlation, mutually related source symbols, and colored noise interferences, the relay-to-destination MIMO channel can be considered as parallel beam-forming single-input single-output (SISO) sub-channels. Moreover, the optimal power allocations to these sub-channels are obtained.

Google proposed the project Loon being developed for providing internet access to remote and rural areas. The project considers solar power for high-altitude balloons. However, the usage of solar power is limited due to time and place. Previously, we have developed the prototype of 5.8 GHz wireless power transmission system with high performance rectenna for an electric vehicle system. By using this experience, we have developed the rough beamforming method based 5.8 GHz wireless power transmission system for high-altitude balloons such as project Loon. In this paper, we describe the developed the rough beamforming method based 5.8 GHz wireless power transmission system. From the measurement results, beamforming phased array antenna can transmit power more efficiently compared with a horn antenna and array antenna without beamforming with increasing the transmission distance. For transmission distance of 1000 mm, beamforming phased array antenna can receive the power about 1.46 times compared with array antenna without beamforming.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15582413","htmlLink":"/document/7302212/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wireless power transmission with rough beamforming method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless power transmission with rough beamforming method","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p305ahn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059645S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7297714","isNumber":"7302153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7297714","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7302153","articleId":"7302212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7302213,"authors":[{"name":"Tran Trung Duy","affiliation":["Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Tran Trung","lastName":"Duy","id":"38259604700"},{"name":"Phung Manh Quynh","affiliation":["Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Phung Manh","lastName":"Quynh","id":"37085716824"},{"name":"Vo Nguyen Quoc Bao","affiliation":["Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Vo Nguyen Quoc","lastName":"Bao","id":"37391822500"},{"name":"Tan Hanh","affiliation":["Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Tan","lastName":"Hanh","id":"37085453335"},{"name":"Dang The Hung","affiliation":["Telecommunications University, Nha Trang, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dang The","lastName":"Hung","id":"37085708954"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6640-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6639-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6638-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302213","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate joint impact of hardware transceiver impairment and interference constraint on performances of cooperative relaying protocols in underlay cognitive radio.

All terminals are equipped with multiple antennas and share the common frequency band. The signal transmission in such HetNets suffers both intra-tier and cross-tier interference. This paper will introduce downlink transmission strategies of the MBS and FBS to eliminate all interference and maximize the system channel capacity. Particularly, the MBS deploys the eigenmode transmission while the FBS aligns its signals into the unused eigenmodes of the MBS transmission. In addition, interference at the FUs is cancelled by aligning the interference signals into the null space of the proper interference channels. Finally, the precoders at the FBS are designed to maximize the total sum rate by an efficient convex optimization algorithm. The numerical experiments are provided to evaluate the sum rate performance of our method in comparison with the other existing approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7297714/7302153/07302215.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"326","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd National Foundation for Science and Technology Development Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS)","doi":"10.1109/NICS.2015.7302215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NICS.2015.7302215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear precoder design for MIMO interference channels in heterogeneous networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Time division multiple access","Downlink","Convex functions","Antennas","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","femtocellular radio","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear precoder design","MIMO interference channels","heterogeneous networks","HetNets","macrobase station","MBS transmission","macrouser","femto base station","FBS","femto users","signal transmission","intratier interference","cross-tier interference","downlink transmission strategies","system channel capacity","eigenmode transmission","interference signals","convex optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear precoder","interference alignment","MIMO interference channel","heterogeneous network","convex optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Linear precoder design for MIMO interference channels in heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302215/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556356","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear precoder design for MIMO interference channels in heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p322long.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042873S","chronDate":"16-18 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7297714","isNumber":"7302153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7297714","xplore-issue":"7302153","articleId":"7302215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302245,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Carlos Alves","affiliation":["Fac. of Eng., Univ. of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jose Carlos","lastName":"Alves","id":"37356713900"},{"name":"Joao Canas Ferreira","affiliation":["FE UP - Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joao Canas","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"38182982300"},{"name":"Pedro Vieira Dos Santos","affiliation":["FE UP - Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Vieira Dos Santos","id":"37088468196"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8035-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8034-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302245","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Arrays","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","C++ language","field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","high level synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","minimum energy broadcast problem","MEB problem","scalable computing array architecture","cellular GAs","coarse-grain parallelism","Xilinx FPGAs","embedded CPU","MicroBlaze","high-level synthesis","HLS design flow","C++","digital design","wireless ad hoc networks","Virtex-6 FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Solving complex optimization problems with genetic algorithms (GAs) with custom computing architectures is a way to improve the execution time of this metaheuristic, which is known to consume considerable amounts of time to converge to final solutions. In this work, we present a scalable computing array architecture to accelerate the execution of cellular GAs (cGAs), a variant of genetic algorithms which can conveniently exploit the coarse-grain parallelism afforded by custom parallel processing. The proposed architecture targets Xilinx FPGAs and is used as an auxiliary processor of an embedded CPU (MicroBlaze). To handle different optimization problems, a high-level synthesis (HLS) design flow is proposed where the problem-dependent operations are specified in C++ and synthesised to custom hardware, thus requiring a minimum knowledge of digital design for FPGAs. The minimum energy broadcast (MEB) problem in wireless ad hoc networks is used as a case study. An existing software implementation of a GA to solve this problem is ported to the proposed computing array to demonstrate its effectiveness and the HLS-based design flow. Implementation results in a Virtex-6 FPGA show significant speedups, while finding solutions with improved quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA Framework for Genetic Algorithms: Solving the Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.81","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302245.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA Framework for Genetic Algorithms: Solving the Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302245/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557048","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA Framework for Genetic Algorithms: Solving the Minimum Energy Broadcast Problem","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070212S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302250,"authors":[{"name":"Panu Sj\u00f6vall","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing Tampere, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Panu","lastName":"Sj\u00f6vall","id":"37085735054"},{"name":"Janne Virtanen","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing Tampere, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37085426352"},{"name":"Jarno Vanne","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing Tampere, University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarno","lastName":"Vanne","id":"37428182200"},{"name":"Timo D.

The final implementation involves Kvazaar encoder executed in Linux on dual-core ARM, and HW accelerated intra prediction on FPGA. Changing the SW/HW partitioning or modifying the implementation takes hours instead of weeks with Catapult-C HLS. In addition, the design is portable to other platforms without major manual re-writing. We obtained 9 fps full-HD intra prediction speed with a single accelerator on Altera Cyclone V SX on Terasic VEEK-MT-C5SoC board including video capture and HEVC video streaming via Ethernet.

It has important applications in many research fields, such as computer graphics, robotics, and machine vision. Direct hardware support of Clifford data types and operators is needed to accelerate applications based on Clifford Algebra. This paper proposes a mixed software-hardware system that exploits the computational power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate Clifford operations. A code generator, namely OpenCLifford, is presented that automatically generates Java and C libraries for the direct support of Clifford elements and operations as well as OpenCL kernels to be executed on the GPU. Experimental tests have been performed to evaluate the speedup of the OpenCL parallel code executed on the GPU against the baseline C code executed on the CPU. Average speedups of 47x and 27x have been measured for 3D and 5D Clifford Algebra, respectively. The paper also presents an execution analysis of an application for fractal generation showing a 35x speedup with respect to the baseline CPU execution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Clifford Algebra Operations Using GPUs and an OpenCL Code Generator","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.44","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302251.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Clifford Algebra Operations Using GPUs and an OpenCL Code Generator","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302251/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556969","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Clifford Algebra Operations Using GPUs and an OpenCL Code Generator","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085926S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302271,"authors":[{"name":"Tom\u00e1 Van\u00e1t","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Spectroscopy, Nuclear Physics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Rez, Czech Republic","Department of Digital Design, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tom\u00e1","lastName":"Van\u00e1t","id":"37085734288"},{"name":"Jan Posp\u00edil","affiliation":["Ceske Vysoke Uceni Technicke v Praze, Praha, CZ"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Posp\u00edil"},{"name":"Filip Kr\u00edek","affiliation":["Akademie ved Ceske republiky, Praha, CZ"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Kr\u00edek"},{"name":"Jozef Ferencei","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Spectroscopy, Nuclear Physics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Rez, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jozef","lastName":"Ferencei","id":"37085723912"},{"name":"Hana Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1","affiliation":["Department of Digital Design, Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Hana","lastName":"Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1","id":"37267112600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8035-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8034-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302271","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cyclotrons","Circuit faults","Particle beams","Protons","Testing","Ionization chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclotrons","field programmable gate arrays","flash memories","life testing","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation testing","physical fault injection","accelerated life testing","ALT","programmable hardware","field programmable gate arrays","cyclotron","single event effects","SEE detection","SRAM","Flash based FPGA"]}],"abstract":"The description of equipment and methods used for conducting ionizing radiation Accelerated Life Testing (ALT) of programmable hardware, especially Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) at the cyclotron is introduced.

Although currently the use of FPGAs as hardware accelerators and especially in clouds is mainly a topic of research, the integration of reconfigurable virtualized resources will become a task of growing importance in the future. We developed a cloud management and hypervisor system called RC3E providing FPGA resources as a service. This paper introduces a computing framework which extends our hypervisor and allows multiple (virtual) user designs on a single physical FPGA. The communication between host and FPGA is implemented by a communication API on the host and the integration of high-level synthesis (HLS) to accelerate applications. We demonstrate the usability of our framework by implementing a sample user design on an FPGA and measuring the performance with up to four simultaneous virtual user designs.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.37","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302294.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.37","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","startPage":"337","endPage":"344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing Framework for Dynamic Integration of Reconfigurable Resources in a Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Computing Framework for Dynamic Integration of Reconfigurable Resources in a Cloud","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302294/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302294/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556975","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing Framework for Dynamic Integration of Reconfigurable Resources in a Cloud","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070068S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302295,"authors":[{"name":"Valery Sklyarov","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics/IEETA/IT University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valery","lastName":"Sklyarov","id":"37371704800"},{"name":"Iouliia Skliarova","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics/IEETA/IT University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Iouliia","lastName":"Skliarova","id":"37284663400"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics/IEETA/IT University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"37290443200"},{"name":"Alexander Sudnitson","affiliation":["Computer Department, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sudnitson","id":"37283482500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8035-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8034-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302295","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Ports (Computers)","Hardware","Clocks","System-on-chip","Acceleration","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","hardware-software codesign","multiprocessing systems","programmable logic devices","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attainable hardware acceleration","programmable systems-on-chip","Zynq-7000 devices","Xilinx","dual-core processing unit","programmable logic","embedded systems","Zynq-based systems","on-chip high-performance interfaces","data sorters","popcount computations","software-hardware solutions","high-performance ports"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["programmable system-on-chip","software/hardware systems","high-performance ports","communication overheads"]}],"abstract":"Zynq-7000 devices from Xilinx incorporate a dual-core processing unit running software, programmable logic that can be customized to implement different hardware circuits, and interfaces enabling interactions and data exchange between software and hardware components to be provided.

The paper compares different types of Zynq-based systems and studies communications between the processing unit and the programmable logic. Thorough evaluation of the available on-chip high-performance interfaces is done based on the results of numerous experiments. Two types of projects that are data sorters and popcount computations were chosen for particular assessments. We found that efficiency of software/hardware solutions depends on many mutually related factors such as the volume of processed data, applied parallelism, and involved high-performance ports. Concrete recommendations based on experiments and comparisons are given and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.45","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","startPage":"345","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Comparison of Attainable Hardware Acceleration in All Programmable Systems-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Comparison of Attainable Hardware Acceleration in All Programmable Systems-on-Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302295/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557069","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7302295/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Comparison of Attainable Hardware Acceleration in All Programmable Systems-on-Chip","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054241S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302296,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Zhao","affiliation":["Testable Design and Test of Integrated Systems (TDT), Centre for Telematics and Information Technology (CTIT), Enschede, the Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38247683700"},{"name":"Hans G.

It is found that decrements of peak IDDT values of crucial functional units inside the processor characterize the power-law degradation with the aging time.

FPGA based stochastic simulation accelerators can exploit parallelism, but have been limited on the size of biomodels they can handle. We present a high performance scalable System on Chip architecture for implementing Gibson and Bruck's Next Reaction Method efficiently in reconfigurable hardware. Our MPSoC uses aggressive pipelining at the core level and also combines many cores into a Network on Chip to also execute in parallel stochastic repetitions of complex biomodels, each one with up to 4K reactions. The performance of our NRM core depends only on the average outdegree of the biomodel's Dependencies Graph (DG) and not on the number of DG nodes (reactions). By adding cores to the NoC, the system's performance scales linearly and reaches GCycles/sec levels. We show that a medium size FPGA running at ~200 MHz deliver high speedup gains relative to a popular and efficient software simulator running on a very powerful workstation PC.","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302331.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable FPGA Accelerator of the NRM Algorithm for Efficient Stochastic Simulation of Large-Scale Biochemical Reaction Networks","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.53","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Scalable FPGA Accelerator of the NRM Algorithm for Efficient Stochastic Simulation of Large-Scale Biochemical Reaction Networks","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7302331/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable FPGA Accelerator of the NRM Algorithm for Efficient Stochastic Simulation of Large-Scale Biochemical Reaction Networks","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069954S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302332,"authors":[{"name":"Runbin Shi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Jiangsu, P.R.

The main issue that hinders broad adoption of this technique is the massive computing workload in CNN that prevents real-time implementation on low-power embedded platforms. Recently, several dedicated solutions have been proposed to improve the energy efficiency and throughput, nevertheless the huge amount of data transfer involved in the processing is still a challenging issue. This work proposes a new CNN accelerator exploiting a novel memory access scheme which significantly improves data locality in CNN related processing. With this scheme, external memory access is reduced by 50% while achieving similar or even better throughput. The accelerator is implemented using 28nm CMOS technology. Implementation results show that the accelerator achieves a performance of 102GOp/s @800MHz while consuming 0.303mm2 in silicon area. Power simulation shows that the dynamic power of the accelerator is 68mW. Its flexibility is demonstrated by running various different CNN benchmarks.","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302332.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Locality Aware Convolutional Neural Networks Accelerator","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.70","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Locality Aware Convolutional Neural Networks Accelerator","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557056","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7302332/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Locality Aware Convolutional Neural Networks Accelerator","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086755S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302333,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37290889900"},{"name":"Haie Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering"],"firstName":"Haie","lastName":"Li","id":"37085497867"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8035-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8034-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302333","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302333","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","IP networks","Power demand","Hardware","Clocks","Optimization","Time factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint theory","integrated circuit design","Pareto optimisation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design space exploration","SoC design process","high-efficiency design","design metrics","IP-reuse","hardware IP protection","design processes","power consumption","resource usage","execution time","IP protection robustness","multiobjective DSE","constrained optimization problem","design performance","application kernels","Pareto frontier","system-on-chip"]}],"abstract":"Design space exploration (DSE) is now an important phase of the SoC design process, in order to realize high-efficiency design.

The approach analytically models power consumption, resource usage, execution time and IP protection robustness of hardware designs, and formulates the expanded multi-objective DSE as a constrained optimization problem. The resultant design from solving the optimization problem achieves trade-offs between design performance and IP protection robustness.

In order to assess and understand the benefits of cache slicing in detail, a precise knowledge of implementation details such as the slice selection algorithm are of high importance. However, slice selection methods are mostly unstudied, and processor manufacturers choose not to publish their designs, nor their design rationale. In this paper, we present a tool that allows to recover the slice selection algorithm for Intel processors. The tool uses cache access information to derive equations that allow the reconstruction of the applied slice selection algorithm. Thereby, the tool enables further exploration of the behavior of modern caches. The tool is successfully applied to a range of Intel CPUs with different slices and architectures. Results show that slice selection algorithms have become more complex over time by involving an increasing number of bits of the physical address. We also demonstrate that among the most recent processors, the slice selection algorithm depends on the number of CPU cores rather than the processor model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302337/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302337/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15556991","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Reverse Engineering of Cache Slice Selection in Intel Processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Reverse Engineering of Cache Slice Selection in Intel Processors","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070739S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302339,"authors":[{"name":"Hannes Gro\u00df","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Graz, Graz, Steiermark, AT"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Gro\u00df"},{"name":"Erich Wenger","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Wenger","id":"38566327100"},{"name":"Christoph Dobraunig","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Dobraunig","id":"37085691182"},{"name":"Christoph Ehrenh\u00f6fer","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Ehrenh\u00f6fer","id":"37085683018"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8035-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8034-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7302339","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Encryption","Throughput","Registers","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","embedded systems","radiofrequency identification","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["made-to-measure hardware implementation","ciphers","confidentiality","authenticity","CAESAR authenticated encryption competition","ASCON design space","RFID tags","wireless sensor nodes","embedded systems","single unrolled round transformation","data processing","Gigabit Ethernet connection encryption","DPA attack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Authenticated encryption","Ascon","CAESAR","hardware implementation","threshold implementation","side-channel protection"]}],"abstract":"Having ciphers that provide confidentiality and authenticity, that are fast in software and efficient in hardware, these are the goals of the CAESAR authenticated encryption competition. In this paper, the promising CAESAR candidate ASCON is implemented in hardware and optimized for different typical applications to fully explore ASCON's design space. Thus, we are able to present hardware implementations of Ascon suitable for RFID tags, Wireless Sensor Nodes, Embedded Systems, and applications that need maximum performance. For instance, we show that an ASCON implementation with a single unrolled round transformation is only 7 kGE large, but can process up to 5.5 Gbit/sec of data (0.75 cycles/byte), which is already enough to encrypt a Gigabit Ethernet connection. Besides, ASCON is not only fast and small, it can also be easily protected against DPA attacks. A threshold implementation of ASCON just requires about 8 kGE of chip area, which is only 3.1 times larger than the unprotected low-area optimized implementation.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2015.14","publicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/7302133/7302233/07302339.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2015.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suit up! -- Made-to-Measure Hardware Implementations of ASCON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302339/","displayDocTitle":"Suit up! -- Made-to-Measure Hardware Implementations of ASCON","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302339/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suit up! -- Made-to-Measure Hardware Implementations of ASCON","confLoc":"Madeira, Portugal","sourcePdf":"8035a645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13266S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7302133","isNumber":"7302233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7302133","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7302233","articleId":"7302339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302506,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The original BTC algorithm partitions an input image into 4 \u00d74 blocks and compresses each block to reduce the data size down to 1/4 of the original size of the data. As the size of a video displayed on an LCD increases, the frame memory size also increases. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the frame memory size further. The previous BTC suffers from a severe quality degradation when its compression ratio exceeds 6 to the original data. This paper proposes a novel BTC-based compression algorithm of which the target compression ratio is 12. To improve the compression efficiency, the proposed algorithm adopts a bit-saving scheme that utilizes the spatial correlation between vertically adjacent blocks. Furthermore, the blocks with low image complexity are coded using one 2 \u00d7 16 coding block while those with high image complexity are coded using two 2 \u00d7 8 coding blocks. With the hardware implementation for a high throughput constraint, the memory sizes of the encoder and decoder are 21,312 bits and 5952 bits, respectively, whereas the gate counts of the encoder and decoder are 68.7 K and 13.6 K, respectively. Experimental results show that the average PSNR of the proposed algorithm is 30.03 dB and that the throughputs of the encoder and decoder are 27.5 Gbps and 63.9 Gbps at operating frequencies of 143 and 333 MHz, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2015.2493163","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/9425/7422859/07302518.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2015.2493163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422859","startPage":"376","endPage":"389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Block Truncation Coding Algorithm and Hardware Implementation Targeting 1/12 Compression for LCD Overdrive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Block Truncation Coding Algorithm and Hardware Implementation Targeting 1/12 Compression for LCD Overdrive","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302518/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15835654","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7302518/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Block Truncation Coding Algorithm and Hardware Implementation Targeting 1/12 Compression for LCD Overdrive","sourcePdf":"jdt-kim-2493163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120969S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"7422859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7422859","articleId":"7302518","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302523,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaming Li","affiliation":["School of Physics and Telecommunication Engineering, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7302523/jli-2492780-small.gif","p":["Jiaming Li received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Physics and Telecommunication Engineering, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the M.Sc. degree.

Optimum UWSN design provides a reliable connection with maximum connectivity, minimal multipath, low technical cost, and emphasis on energy conservation. This paper examines the channel estimation parameters, such as channel impulse response, coherence bandwidth, BER due to delay for differentially detected MSK receiver, and transmission loss impact of underwater node placement in three scenarios (ground-based, buoys-based, and horizontal point-to-point sensor node). All data (bathymetry, altimetry, temperature, salinity, and depth) are real and have been sourced from different satellite databases.

However, for some signals, the input resistance of the ESPAR antenna (EA) becomes negative. A negative input resistance would lead to oscillatory/unstable behavior of an EA to transmit signals. In this work, we address this issue of an EA by obtaining approximate signals for transmission, which are close to the ideal signals in the mean-squared-error (MSE) sense, and satisfy the requirement that the input resistance is positive. Specifically, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the MSE between the ideal and the approximate signals taking into account the constraint on the input resistance. Closed-form expressions to calculate the approximate signal vector from ideal signal vector are also obtained, resulting in simplified processing at the transmitter. We denote the EA utilizing the novel closed-form expressions as EA with preprocessing (EA-P) and the EA without any preprocessing as the standard EA (EA-S). The performance of EA-P is compared with the performance of EA-S and the standard multiple antenna system, with multiple RF chains, under various communication scenarios. Our simulations show that the performance of EA-S significantly degrades compared with the standard multiple antenna system and an error floor is obtained. However, using the proposed EA-P scheme, the error floor is avoided and nearly the same performance as that of the standard multiple antenna system is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2493140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

challenge due to the absence of known biomarkers; hence a better understanding of their pathophysiology and brain alterations is urgently needed. Given the complexity, feature selection is especially important in neuroimaging applications, however, feature dimension and model understanding present serious challenges. In this study, a novel feature selection approach based on linear support vector machine with a forward-backward search strategy (SVM-FoBa) was developed and applied to structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 21 BD, 25 MDD and 23 healthy controls. Discriminative features were drawn from both data modalities, with which the classification of BD and MDD achieved an accuracy of 92.1% (1000 bootstrap resamples). Weight analysis of the selected features further revealed that the inferior frontal gyrus may characterize a central role in BD-MDD differentiation, in addition to the default mode network and the cerebellum. A modality-wise comparison also suggested that functional information outweighs anatomical by a large margin when classifying the two clinical disorders. This work validated the advantages of multimodal joint analysis and the effectiveness of SVM-FoBa, which has potential for use in identifying possible biomarkers for several mental disorders.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7350310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563672/7350310/07302542.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAMD.2015.2440298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAMD.2015.2440298","startPage":"320","endPage":"331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminating Bipolar Disorder From Major Depression Based on SVM-FoBa: Efficient Feature Selection With Multimodal Brain Imaging Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302542/","displayDocTitle":"Discriminating Bipolar Disorder From Major Depression Based on SVM-FoBa: Efficient Feature Selection With Multimodal Brain Imaging Data","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302542/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15661706","pubMedId":"26858825","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminating Bipolar Disorder From Major Depression Based on SVM-FoBa: Efficient Feature Selection With Multimodal Brain Imaging Data","sourcePdf":"tamd-sui-2440298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139249S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"7350310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7350310","articleId":"7302542","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7302543,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Tayem","affiliation":["Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Al-Khobar, Eastern, SA"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Tayem"},{"name":"Khaqan Majeed","affiliation":["Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University, Al-Khobar, Eastern, SA"],"firstName":"Khaqan","lastName":"Majeed"},{"name":"Ahmed A.

We analyze the multipacket HARQ, where the transmitter allows two different packets to share the same channel block; this stands in contrast with the conventional HARQ, where each packet occupies the entire block. We then optimally assign resources within the block to each packet and in each transmission round. We study superposition coding and time-sharing encoding strategies, and we optimize their parameters to maximize the throughput. Besides the conventional, one-bit (ACK/NACK) signaling we also consider a multibit feedback. We formulate our problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the decisions concerning the encoding strategies and their parameters are taken using additional information obtained from the receiver via feedback channel. In the case of the one-bit (ACK/NACK) signaling, the partial state information Markov decision process (PSI-MDP) framework is used to obtain the optimal policies. Numerical examples obtained in a Rayleigh-fading channel indicate that, the proposed multipacket HARQ outperforms the conventional one, by more than 5 dB for high-spectral efficiencies.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2493138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07302544.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2493138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","startPage":"5191","endPage":"5205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipacket Hybrid ARQ: Closing Gap to the Ergodic Capacity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multipacket Hybrid ARQ: Closing Gap to the Ergodic Capacity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302544/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677250","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7302544/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"government of Quebec","grantNumber":"#PSR-SIIRI-435"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communication Conference (GLOBECOM)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipacket Hybrid ARQ: Closing Gap to the Ergodic Capacity","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jabi-2493138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144242S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7302544","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7302548,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Koziel","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland","Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Slawomir","lastName":"Koziel","id":"37270222900"},{"name":"Adrian Bekasiewicz","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Reykjavik University, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Bekasiewicz","id":"38233401400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7302548","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":393},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302548","abstract":"A simple yet robust methodology for rapid multiobjective design optimization of antenna structures has been presented. The key component of our approach is sequential domain patching of the design space, which is a stencil-based search that aims at creating a path that connects the extreme Pareto-optimal designs, obtained by means of single-objective optimization runs. The patching process yields the initial approximation of the Pareto set representing the best possible tradeoffs between conflicting design objectives. It is realized-for the sake of computational efficiency-at the level of coarse-discretization electromagnetic (EM) simulation model. The final Pareto front is subsequently obtained using surrogate-assisted optimization where the EM simulation data acquired at the initial design stage is reused.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2493240","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1092","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07302548.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2493240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Antenna Design By Means of Sequential Domain Patching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Computational modeling","Algorithm design and analysis","Approximation methods","Data models","Microwave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","approximation theory","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design stage","EM simulation data","surrogate-assisted optimization","coarse-discretization electromagnetic simulation model","computational efficiency","Pareto set","patching process","single-objective optimization","Pareto-optimal designs","stencil-based search","antenna structures","multiobjective design optimization","sequential domain patching","multiobjective antenna design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna design","design space patching","electromagnetic (EM) simulation","multiobjective design","surrogate modeling","surrogate-based optimization","variable-fidelity simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Antenna Design By Means of Sequential Domain Patching","volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/7302548/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2016","accessionNumber":"15883734","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Antenna Design By Means of Sequential Domain Patching","sourcePdf":"lawp-koziel-2493240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047699S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7302548","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7302558,"authors":[{"name":"Fuxi Wen","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fuxi","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085445100"},{"name":"Chen Liang","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085448848"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7302558","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1019},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Mobile data traffic is expected to have an exponential growth in the future. To meet the challenge of mobile data traffic exponential growth, massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) has been proposed as one of the enabling technologies for future wireless systems. Due to the huge number of antennas at the base station, it is more reasonable to rely on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation to perform downlink precoding. This is one of the main reasons why direction information becomes critical for such a system. The measurement of 2D massive MIMO can be expressed as a 3D tensor. In this letter, we propose an improved tensor method of direction estimation (IT-MODE) based DOA estimation algorithm. It is a modification of the conventional tensor method of direction estimation (T-MODE) algorithm, and the threshold performance is improved. Asymptotic efficiency is achieved for the proposed estimator even when the source signals are highly correlated or coherent.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07302558.pdf","startPage":"2182","endPage":"2185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2493064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2493064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Tensor-MODE Based Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Tensile stress","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication","mobile communication","precoding","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","DOA estimation algorithm","massive multiple input multiple output","massive MIMO systems","mobile data traffic","downlink precoding","improved tensor method of direction estimation","IT-MODE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["massive MIMO","DOA estimation","MODE","tensor-MODE","higher-order singular value decomposition"]},{"kwd":["Massive MIMO","DOA estimation","MODE","tensor-MODE","higher-order singular value decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved Tensor-MODE Based Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"19","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7302558/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15661670","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Tensor-MODE Based Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wen-2493064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054285S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"7302558","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302562,"authors":[{"name":"Alec Burmania","affiliation":["Erik Jonsson School of Engineering & Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, TX"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165369/7755879/7302562/burma-2493525-small.gif","p":["Alec Burmania (S\u201912) is a senior at the University of Texas at\n Dallas (UTD) majoring in electrical engineering.

Conventionally, this metadata has been collected through manual annotations by experts. With the advent of crowdsourcing services, the scientific community has begun to crowdsource many tasks that researchers deem tedious, but can be easily completed by many human annotators. While crowdsourcing is a cheaper and more efficient approach, the quality of the annotations becomes a limitation in many cases. This paper investigates the use of reference sets with predetermined ground-truth to monitor annotators' accuracy and fatigue, all in real-time. The reference set includes evaluations that are identical in form to the relevant questions that are collected, so annotators are blind to whether or not they are being graded on performance on a specific question. We explore these ideas on the emotional annotation of the MSP-IMPROV database. We present promising results which suggest that our system is suitable for collecting accurate annotations.","doi":"10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2493525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165369/7755879/07302562.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2015.2493525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7755879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing the Reliability of Crowdsourcing Evaluations Using Online Quality Assessment","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165369/7755879/7302562-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the Reliability of Crowdsourcing Evaluations Using Online Quality Assessment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302562/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16496869","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS 1217104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"IIS-1453781"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Increasing the Reliability of Crowdsourcing Evaluations Using Online Quality Assessment","sourcePdf":"taffc-busso-2493525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090849S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"7755879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7755879","articleId":"7302562","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":7302564,"authors":[{"name":"Jiandong Tan","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085696561"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"},{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085360215"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37399861100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7302564","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":641},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Bit error rate","Nonlinear distortion","Receivers","OFDM","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free-space optical communication","light emitting diodes","maximum likelihood detection","OFDM modulation","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonclipped DCO-OFDM","MLSD receiver","calculation complexity","near-optimal low-complexity MLSD method","double-sided clipping characteristic","maximum likelihood sequence detection","visible light communication systems","clipping distortion","light emitting diode component","peak-to-average power ratio issue","DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","near-optimal low-complexity sequence detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication (VLC)","DC-biased orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM)","maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD)","clipping distortion"]},{"kwd":["Visible light communication (VLC)","dc-biased orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM)","maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD)","clipping distortion"]}],"abstract":"The inherent high peak-to-average power ratio issue of dc-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) is sensitive to the limited dynamic region of light emitting diode component and prone to clipping distortion, which deteriorates the performance of visible light communication systems.

In this control scheme, the feedback signals are transmitted, and the NN weights are tuned in an aperiodic manner at the event sampled instants. After reviewing the NN approximation property with event sampled inputs, an adaptive state estimator (SE), consisting of linearly parameterized NNs, is utilized to approximate the unknown system dynamics in an event sampled context. The SE is viewed as a model and its approximated dynamics and the state vector, during any two events, are utilized for the event-triggered controller design. An adaptive event-trigger condition is derived by using both the estimated NN weights and a dead-zone operator to determine the event sampling instants. This condition both facilitates the NN approximation and reduces the transmission of feedback signals. The ultimate boundedness of both the NN weight estimation error and the system state vector is demonstrated through the Lyapunov approach. As expected, during an initial online learning phase, events are observed more frequently. Over time with the convergence of the NN weights, the inter-event times increase, thereby lowering the number of triggered events. These claims are illustrated through the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472290","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7360252/07302570.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2472290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network-Based Event-Triggered Control of Single-Input Single-Output Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5962385/7360252/7302570-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network-Based Event-Triggered Control of Single-Input Single-Output Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems","volume":"27","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15678239","pubMedId":"26513802","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7302570/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 1406533"},{"fundingName":"Intelligent Systems Center, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Adaptive Neural Network-Based Event-Triggered Control of Single-Input Single-Output Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-sahoo-2472290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116589S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7360252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7360252","articleId":"7302570","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7302573,"authors":[{"name":"Qingshan Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7407441/7302573/liu-2481006-small.gif","p":["Qingshan Liu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in automation and computer-aided engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008.","He was a Research Associate with the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2009 and 2011.

In a classical transmitter (Alice)-legitimate receiver (Bob)-eavesdropper (Eve) model using artificial noise to disturb Eve's reception, we consider a general scenario where all nodes are equipped with multiple antennas, and Bob's CSI is acquired by pilot-assisted channel estimation. For designing the secure transmit beamforming, we utilize random matrix quantization (RMQ) to quantize Bob's channel estimate, and then Bob feeds it back to Alice. Due to the effects of imperfect CSI at Alice, the secrecy performance is upper bounded in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. In order to avoid the interference-limited phenomenon, we present a scaled strategy for the secrecy system utilizing derived upper bound on the secrecy rate loss. Moreover, it is shown that our derived results can be easily extended to a special case where both legitimate and eavesdropping receivers equip a single antenna each, where random vector quantization (RVQ) is utilized instead. By employing our proposed feedback strategy, the secrecy rate increases with transmit power, and the certain secrecy requirement can be guaranteed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7302574/","accessionNumber":"15785886","displayDocTitle":"On Performance and Feedback Strategy of Secure Multiuser Communications With MMSE Channel Estimate","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61471114, 61461136003, 61501110, 61571118, 61472001 and 61173188"},{"fundingName":"973 program","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu, China","grantNumber":"BK20150635"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Performance and Feedback Strategy of Secure Multiuser Communications With MMSE Channel Estimate","sourcePdf":"twc-peng-2493145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124446S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7302574","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7302577,"authors":[{"name":"Yongxin Gao","affiliation":["Center for Information Engineering Science Research, School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7544551/7302577/gao-2487882-small.gif","p":["Yongxin Gao received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2001 and 2012, respectively.","From 2001 to 2004, he was a Technical Engineer with Xi\u2019an Datang Telecom Technology Company Ltd., Xi\u2019an.

We propose a formulation to restrict the set of possible cross-covariance matrices. The constraint in the formulation, named allowance of cross-covariance, provides a flexible way to utilize some prior information on cross-correlation in fusion methods. Then based on the allowance, an optimal robust fusion method is proposed in the minimax sense via semi-definite programming, and suboptimal fusion methods are also discussed to reduce the computational load. We analyze the properties of the proposed fusion methods and describe the relationships between our proposed fusion and some existing fusion methods. Numerical examples are given to illustrate their performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","volume":"46","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"16231719","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302577/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Linear Estimation Fusion With Allowable Unknown Cross-Covariance","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Program for Basic Research of China (973)","grantNumber":"2013CB329405"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of China","grantNumber":"61403299"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000104","fundingName":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration/LEQSF(2013-15)-Phase3-06","grantNumber":"NNX13AD29A"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"NNSF of China","grantNumber":"61473197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Linear Estimation Fusion With Allowable Unknown Cross-Covariance","sourcePdf":"tsmc-gao-2487882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109424S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7544551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7544551","articleId":"7302577","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7302578,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Joon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7302578/kim-2493142-small.gif","p":["\n\nYoung-Joon Kim (S'14) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical \nengineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2008 and 2010, \nrespectively.

In this paper, a selective WPT technique using magnetic resonance coupling (MRC) is introduced for smart power delivery in a multiple-receiver system. The proposed method selectively and exclusively delivers power to only one designated receiver among multiple receivers, eliminating the cross-coupling effect and unbalanced power division problem across the receivers. This is achieved by separating the resonant frequencies of the receivers to isolate the coupling effects between coils. The power division ratio of the receivers is controlled by changing the duration time ratio for power transfer. In this paper, a one-transmitter three-receiver selective MRC system is designed and fabricated. The power distribution is demonstrated under impedance matched condition, showing a power transfer efficiency of 24%-29% at a very small coupling coefficient of 0.01 with a 12-mm-diameter receiver coil. Distance compensation and a one-way communication of time division multiple access are demonstrated for a multiple-receiver system, using the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2493142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07302578.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2493142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","startPage":"1853","endPage":"1862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Wireless Power Transfer for Smart Power Distribution in a Miniature-Sized Multiple-Receiver System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selective Wireless Power Transfer for Smart Power Distribution in a Miniature-Sized Multiple-Receiver System","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302578/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15775338","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7302578/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"N66001-12-1-4029."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Wireless Power Transfer for Smart Power Distribution in a Miniature-Sized Multiple-Receiver System","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2493142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123098S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7302578","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7302582,"authors":[{"name":"Vasilis Ntranos","affiliation":["University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA","Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Vasilis Ntranos (S\u201910) received the Diploma degree in electronics and computer engineering from the Technical University of Crete, Greece, 2008.

On the other hand, it is known that practical one-shot IA precoding (i.e., linear schemes without symbol expansion) provides a vanishing DoFs gain in large fully connected networks with generic channel coefficients. In our previous work, we introduced the concept of cellular IA for a network topology induced by hexagonal cells with sectors and nearest-neighbor interference. Assuming that neighboring sectors can exchange decoded messages (and not received signal samples) in the uplink, we showed that linear one-shot IA precoding over M transmit/ receive antennas can achieve the optimal M/2 DoFs per user. In this paper, we extend this framework to networks with omnidirectional (non-sectorized) cells and consider a limited practical scenario where users have 2 antennas, and base-stations have 2, 3, or 4 antennas. We provide linear one-shot IA schemes for the 2 \u00d7 2, 2 \u00d7 3, and 2 \u00d7 4 cases, and show the achievability of 3/4, 1, and 7/6 DoFs per user, respectively. DoFs converses for one-shot schemes require the solution of a discrete optimization problem over a number of variables that grows with the network size. We develop a new approach to transform such optimization problem into a tractable linear program with significantly fewer variables. This approach is used to show that 3/4 DoFs per user are indeed optimal for one-shot schemes over large (extended) cellular network with 2 \u00d7 2 links.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2493152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7331248/07302582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2493152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331248","startPage":"6663","endPage":"6679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular Interference Alignment: Omni-Directional Antennas and Asymmetric Configurations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cellular Interference Alignment: Omni-Directional Antennas and Asymmetric Configurations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15601915","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7302582/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering through NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-CIF 1161801"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular Interference Alignment: Omni-Directional Antennas and Asymmetric Configurations","sourcePdf":"tit-caire-2493152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107928S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7331248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7331248","articleId":"7302582","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302583,"authors":[{"name":"Collin S.

A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm will face a challenge to obtain a series of compromises of different objectives, called Pareto optimal solutions, and to distribute them uniformly. In this regard, it is essential to keep the balance of local and global search abilities of such algorithms. Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is a population-based swarm intelligence algorithm, and differential evolutionary (DE) is another simple population-based stochastic search one for global optimization with real-valued parameters. Although the two optimizers have been successfully employed to solve a wide range of design problems, they also suffer from premature convergence and insufficient diversity in the later searching stages. This is probably due to the insufficient dimensional searching strength, especially for problems with many decision parameters. In this paper, a new multi-objective non-dominated optimal methodology combining QPSO, DE, and tabu search algorithm (QPSO-DET) is proposed to guarantee the balance between the local and global searches. The performances of the proposed QPSO-DET are compared with those of other two widely recognized vector optimizers using different case studies.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2493181","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2493181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7410156/07302590.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybridized Vector Optimal Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimal Designs of Electromagnetic Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302590/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybridized Vector Optimal Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimal Designs of Electromagnetic Devices","volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7302590/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15786617","externalId":"7001004","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybridized Vector Optimal Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimal Designs of Electromagnetic Devices","sourcePdf":"tmag-yang-2493181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075249S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7410156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7410156","articleId":"7302590","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7302592,"authors":[{"name":"Wil van der Aalst","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/7348817/7302592/aalst-small.gif","p":["Wil van der Aalst is a full professor of information systems at the\n Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (TU/e).

Big data initiatives rarely focus on the improvement of end-to-end processes. To address this mismatch, we advocate a better integration of data science, data technology and process science.

While codes over several metrics have been studied, such as the Kendall \u03c4, Ulam, and Hamming distances, no recent research has been carried out for erasures and deletions over permutations. In rank modulation, flash memory cells represent a permutation, which is induced by their relative charge levels. We explore problems that arise when some of the cells are either erased or deleted. In each case, we study how these erasures and deletions affect the information carried by the remaining cells. In particular, we study models that are symbol-invariant, where unaffected elements do not change their corresponding values from those in the original permutation, or permutation-invariant, where the remaining symbols are modified to form a new permutation with fewer elements. Our main approach in tackling these problems is to build upon the existing works of error-correcting codes and leverage them in order to construct codes in each model of deletions and erasures. The codes we develop are in certain cases asymptotically optimal, while in other cases, such as for codes in the Ulam distance, improve upon the state of the art results.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2493147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2493147","startPage":"136","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7360961/07302598.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codes Correcting Erasures and Deletions for Rank Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Codes Correcting Erasures and Deletions for Rank Modulation","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15678220","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7302598/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S.\u2013Israel Binational Science Foundation, Jerusalem, Israel","grantNumber":"2010075"},{"fundingName":"Smart Scholarship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000179","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1029030, CCF-1150212 and CIF-1218005"},{"fundingName":"NISE Program at SSC Pacific"},{"fundingName":"NSF GRFP"},{"fundingName":"Intellectual Ventures"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codes Correcting Erasures and Deletions for Rank Modulation","sourcePdf":"tit-dolecek-2493147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164042S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7360961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7360961","articleId":"7302598","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7302601,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhe Xu","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7302601/yuzxu-2493066-small.gif","p":["Yuzhe Xu received the Bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China, and the Master\u2019s degree in system control and robotics program from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2005 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, a novel approach to maximizing the transmission rates in the secondary network by optimizing the relay selection, the secondary transmit powers, and the cooperative relaying power splitting parameters is proposed. The resulting optimization problem is mixed integer and nonconvex, which makes it NP hard to find the optimal solutions. Therefore, centralized and distributed solution methods to find near-to-optimal solutions of this challenging problem are proposed. The methods are based on iteratively solving the secondary relay selection by a greedy approach, and the optimal power allocation problem by a fixed-point approach together with alternating direction method of multipliers. It is established that both centralized and distributed solution methods always converge. The numerical results illustrate how the performance of the proposed solution methods depend on the primary performance margins, and show that they give a near-to-optimal solution in few iterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302601/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","volume":"15","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"15785868","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302601/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Spectrum Leasing via Vertical Cooperation in Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU project Hydrobionets"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Spectrum Leasing via Vertical Cooperation in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-yuzhe-2493066-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10372S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7302601","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302605,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Barzegarkhoo","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7302605/barze-small.gif","p":["Reza Barzegarkhoo received the B.Sc. degree in electrical power\n engineering from the University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran, in 2010, and the M.Sc. degree from the Sahand University of\n Technology, Tabriz, Iran, in 2012.","His major research interests include design and control of power electronic converters, multilevel voltage source\n inverters, charge balancing control, switched-capacitor converters, and photovoltaic systems."]},"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Barzegarkhoo","id":"37085383593"},{"name":"Hossein Madadi Kojabadi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7302605/kojab-small.gif","p":["Hossein Madadi Kojabadi (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, in 2003.","He is currently a Professor at the Sahand University of Technology, Tabriz, Iran and the Managing Director of the\n Renewable Energy Research Center.

The proposed SCC will boost the input dc power supply voltage without transformer by switching the capacitors in series and in parallel. Next, a new single phase switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) topology which uses the proposed SCC units as virtual dc links have been proposed. The proposed topologies reduce the number of power switches, diodes, isolated dc power supplies, size, and the cost of the system in comparison with conventional similar topologies. For example, by contribution of proposed SCMLI structure, 49 and 137 output voltage levels are made by only 14 and18 power switches and 3 and 4 isolated dc power supplies, respectively.

As opposed to conventional structures [i.e., constructed using uniform transmission lines (TLs)], re-design of miniaturized circuits (e.g., implemented with artificial TLs) for different operating frequencies is far from being straightforward due to considerable cross-couplings between the circuit components. Here, we develop a simple and computationally efficient methodology for dimension scaling of the compact circuits. The proposed approach utilizes an equivalent circuit representation to identify a fast inverse model that determines the relationship between the geometry parameters of the structure at hand and its operating frequency. Upon suitable correction, the inverse model is applied to find dimensions of the scaled design at the high-fidelity (electromagnetic (EM) simulation) model level. Owing to reasonable correlations between the low- and high-fidelity models, the circuit geometry scaled to a requested operating frequency can be found using just a single EM simulation of the structure, despite possible absolute discrepancies between the models. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using two exemplary compact couplers scaled in wide ranges from 0.5 to 2 GHz and from 0.5 to 1.8 GHz, respectively. The numerical results are supported by physical measurements of the fabricated coupler prototypes.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2490662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7343772/07302606.pdf","startPage":"4019","endPage":"4026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2490662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expedited Geometry Scaling of Compact Microwave Passives by Means of Inverse Surrogate Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302606/","displayDocTitle":"Expedited Geometry Scaling of Compact Microwave Passives by Means of Inverse Surrogate Modeling","volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15635440","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302606/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expedited Geometry Scaling of Compact Microwave Passives by Means of Inverse Surrogate Modeling","sourcePdf":"tmtt-koziel-2490662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062116S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7343772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7343772","articleId":"7302606","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7302607,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Abbaszadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, K.

The ICM method can model the magnetic induction inside a permanent magnet (PM) due to the armature reaction and the relative recoil permeability. The ICM method can also consider the simultaneous influences of the armature reaction, the slotting effect, the magnetic saturation, and the relative recoil permeability in the determination of operating points of the PM in its different parts. Therefore, this proposed method can be useful for an on-load performance analysis of SPM motors. Three conformal mappings are used to reach the main canonical domain: two logarithmic complex functions and the Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping. The field solution in the slotless domain is then mapped back into the slotted domain using the complex air-gap permeance. The field solution in the slotted domain is used to calculate the on-load air-gap field components due to the PMs and the armature reaction. These on-load field components allow the calculation of the on-load PM flux linkage, the on-load PM back-EMF, and the on-load torque components. The influences of electric loading on the on-load torque components and the on-load PM back-EMF are studied using the ICM method. The on-load cogging torque periodicity is confirmed to change due to the magnetic saturation, and the harmonic content of torque components and the PM back-EMF is also altered due to the electric loading. The accuracy of this developed model is verified by comparing the results obtained through the ICM method with the respective results obtained through the finite-element analysis and the frozen permeability method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2493150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7384817/07302607.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2493150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Load Field Component Separation in Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"On-Load Field Component Separation in Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","volume":"52","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7302607/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"externalId":"5200112","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720319","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302607/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Load Field Component Separation in Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors Using an Improved Conformal Mapping Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-rezaeealam-2493150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142601S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7384817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7384817","articleId":"7302607","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7302609,"authors":[{"name":"Zhouye Chen","affiliation":["IRIT UMR CNRS 5505, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Zhouye","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085672656"},{"name":"Adrian Basarab","affiliation":["IRIT UMR CNRS 5505, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Basarab","id":"37298011900"},{"name":"Denis Kouam\u00e9","affiliation":["IRIT UMR CNRS 5505, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Kouam\u00e9","id":"37297806700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"7302609","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Deconvolution","Image coding","Radio frequency","Image reconstruction","Ultrasonic imaging","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","compressed sensing","deconvolution","image enhancement","image reconstruction","medical image processing","optical transfer function","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive deconvolution","medical ultrasound imaging","compressive sampling","RF data","ultrasound pulse emissions","RF image spatial resolution","signal to noise ratio","imaging transducer","US wave propagation","deconvolution-based image processing techniques","enhanced RF images","compressed measurements","direct acquisition model","2D convolution","invariant point spread function","joint data volume reduction","image quality improvement","optimization method","alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sampling","deconvolution","ultrasound imaging","alternating direction method of multipliers"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Phantoms, Imaging","Ultrasonography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302609","abstract":"The interest of compressive sampling in ultrasound imaging has been recently extensively evaluated by several research teams. Following the different application setups, it has been shown that the RF data may be reconstructed from a small number of measurements and/or using a reduced number of ultrasound pulse emissions. Nevertheless, RF image spatial resolution, contrast and signal to noise ratio are affected by the limited bandwidth of the imaging transducer and the physical phenomenon related to US wave propagation. To overcome these limitations, several deconvolution-based image processing techniques have been proposed to enhance the ultrasound images. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named compressive deconvolution, that reconstructs enhanced RF images from compressed measurements. Exploiting an unified formulation of the direct acquisition model, combining random projections and 2D convolution with a spatially invariant point spread function, the benefit of our approach is the joint data volume reduction and image quality improvement. The proposed optimization method, based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, is evaluated on both simulated and in vivo data.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2493241","startPage":"728","endPage":"737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2493241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7422860/07302609.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Deconvolution in Medical Ultrasound Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302609/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Compressive Deconvolution in Medical Ultrasound Imaging","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7302609/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15823107","pubMedId":"26513780","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Deconvolution in Medical Ultrasound Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-chen-2493241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114614S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7422860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7422860","articleId":"7302609","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7302635,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Brayton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7302610/7302635/brayt-2487798-small.gif","p":["\nRobert Brayton (Fellow, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 1961.","He was a member of the Mathematical Sciences Department, IBM T.

Transmit antenna selection is used to reduce the number of radio frequency units, system complexity and system cost, making massive MIMO more applicable. Special attention is given to study the effect of the number of available antennae and radio frequency units on the performance of the system. Three types of transmit beamforming techniques are considered, namely, maximum ratio transmission beamforming, zero forcing beamforming, and minimum mean square error beamforming. The numerical results of the paper clearly show that transmit antenna selection affects the performance of massive MIMO systems for all considered types of transmit beamforming. In particular, it is shown that lower bit error rate can be achieved with small number of selected antennae from a large group of actual transmit antennae. This is of course in addition to the great advantage from the system complexity perspectives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of massive multiuser MIMO with different transmit beamforming techniques and antenna selection","publicationTitle":"2015 1st URSI Atlantic Radio Science Conference (URSI AT-RASC)","doi":"10.1109/URSI-AT-RASC.2015.7302990","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 1st URSI Atlantic Radio Science Conference (URSI AT-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298079/7302814/07302990.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSI-AT-RASC.2015.7302990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7302990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7302990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of massive multiuser MIMO with different transmit beamforming techniques and antenna selection","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7302990/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15556508","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of massive multiuser MIMO with different transmit beamforming techniques and antenna selection","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049872S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298079","isNumber":"7302814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298079","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7302814","articleId":"7302990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"International Union of Radio Science (URSI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7303040,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Since the outdoor environment is usually very complex and electrically large, the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) method (one technique of ray tracing) rather than other numerical methods such as finite difference time domain method and finite element method, is often applied in the computation. However, a large amount of rays have to be launched to guarantee the accuracy in conventional ray tracing methods. This, in turn, increases the simulation time significantly. Recently, many acceleration algorithms have been reported including space partitioning and wavefront decomposition. This paper presents a novel adaptive ray launching (ARL) method based on the pattern of transmitting antenna, which reduces the launched ray number significantly while maintaining the computation accuracy","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Site-specific wave propagation prediction with improved shooting and bouncing ray tracing method","publicationTitle":"2015 1st URSI Atlantic Radio Science Conference (URSI AT-RASC)","doi":"10.1109/URSI-AT-RASC.2015.7303040","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 1st URSI Atlantic Radio Science Conference (URSI AT-RASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298079/7302814/07303040.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSI-AT-RASC.2015.7303040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Site-specific wave propagation prediction with improved shooting and bouncing ray tracing method","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Site-specific wave propagation prediction with improved shooting and bouncing ray tracing method","confLoc":"Gran Canaria, Spain","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045668S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","isNumber":"7302814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298079","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7303040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7303259,"authors":[{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, SG"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/57/7302812/7303259/7303259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Min Wu is currently a research scientist in the Data Analytics Department at the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) under the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A *STAR), Singapore.

First, the current signals acquired from the main motor are processed in a normalized time-frequency map. Next, the characteristics fault patterns are identified and numerically characterized. A double self-organized map structure is proposed to manage the information till compress it to just two features by means of a topology codification of the data space. Finally, a neural network based classification algorithm is used to classify the condition of the camshaft. The effectiveness of this condition monitoring scheme has been verified by experimental results obtained from industrial machinery.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303679","startPage":"124","endPage":"130","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7303654","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295715/7303654/07303679.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis method based on topology codification and neural network applied to an industrial camshaft","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303679/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis method based on topology codification and neural network applied to an industrial camshaft","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7303679/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15554639","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis method based on topology codification and neural network applied to an industrial camshaft","confLoc":"Guarda, Portugal","sourcePdf":"SPD644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084572S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295715","isNumber":"7303654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295715","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7303654","articleId":"7303679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7303681,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This progressing adoption begins with the replacement of the current solutions, but this presents the design challenge of finding a surrogate which conforms to the specifications for a given application. In order to overcome this challenge, an evolutionary design methodology for SynRM is presented. The proposed approach uses a set of design constraints to maximize the mechanical power of the motor taking into account the specified rated speed. Since the calculation of the torque of the motor is critical, an iterative method for the evaluation of iron losses has been introduced. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by means of FEM simulation and the calculation of the efficiency map of the results.","doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303712","startPage":"338","endPage":"344","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295715/7303654/07303712.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7303654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained-size torque maximization in SynRM machines by means of genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Sociology","Statistics","Mathematical model","Geometry","Genetic algorithms","Reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","iterative methods","reluctance motors","synchronous motors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained-size torque maximization","SynRM machines","synchronous reluctance motors","industrial applications","evolutionary design methodology","mechanical power","iterative method","iron losses evaluation","FEM simulation","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric machines","Finite element analysis","Genetic programming","Optimization","Torque"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Constrained-size torque maximization in SynRM machines by means of genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7303712/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15582384","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained-size torque maximization in SynRM machines by means of genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Guarda, Portugal","sourcePdf":"SPD702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098128S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295715","isNumber":"7303654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295715","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7303654","articleId":"7303712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7303722,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Lorzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Lorzadeh","id":"37542567400"},{"name":"Mehdi Savaghebi","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Savaghebi","id":"37540913900"},{"name":"Hossein Askarian Abyaneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein Askarian","lastName":"Abyaneh","id":"37400372200"},{"name":"Josep M.

However, the inclusion of LCL-filters in voltage source inverters complicates the current control design regarding system stability issues; because an inherent resonance peak appears due to zero impedance at that resonance frequency. Moreover, in grid-interactive low-voltage microgrids, the interactions among the LCL-filtered-based parallel inverters may result in a more complex multi-resonance issue which may compromise the power quality and stability of the microgrid. Therefore, due to the effect of resonances on the system stability and power quality, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review of resonance characteristics and related issues in single- and multi-inverter-systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces the different active damping approaches for grid-connected inverters with LCL filters, which are based on high-order filters and additional feedbacks methods. These techniques are analyzed and discussed in detail.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Inverters","Capacitors","Impedance","Resonant frequency","Power harmonic filters","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","electric current control","invertors","LC circuits","power filters","power supply quality","power system stability","resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active damping techniques","LCL-filtered inverters-based microgrids","grid-connected voltage source inverters","current control design","zero impedance","resonance frequency","grid-interactive low-voltage microgrids","LCL-filtered-based parallel inverters","power quality","multiinverter systems","high-order filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping techniques","grid-interactive microgrid","LCL-filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303722","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295715/7303654/07303722.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7303654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping techniques for LCL-filtered inverters-based microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active damping techniques for LCL-filtered inverters-based microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303722/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7303722/","accessionNumber":"15582382","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping techniques for LCL-filtered inverters-based microgrids","confLoc":"Guarda, Portugal","sourcePdf":"SPD722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080914S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295715","isNumber":"7303654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295715","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7303654","articleId":"7303722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7303762,"authors":[{"name":"Beno\u00eet Derat","affiliation":["ART-Fi SAS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Derat","id":"37318582000"},{"name":"Lyazid Aberbour","affiliation":["ART-Fi SAS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Lyazid","lastName":"Aberbour","id":"37547887000"},{"name":"Andrea Cozza","affiliation":["CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Electromagnetics Department, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Cozza","id":"37392083000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8543-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8542-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7303762","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"abstract":"The complexity of radiofrequency technologies used in smartphones and tablets has considerably increased the need for more efficient Specific Absorption Rate assessment approaches.

The proposed antenna design also has good performance and small size.","doi":"10.1109/IMWS-BIO.2015.7303852","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE MTT-S 2015 International Microwave Workshop Series on RF and Wireless Technologies for Biomedical and Healthcare Applications (IMWS-BIO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE MTT-S 2015 International Microwave Workshop Series on RF and Wireless Technologies for Biomedical and Healthcare Applications (IMWS-BIO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7297713/7303738/07303852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS-BIO.2015.7303852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7303738","startPage":"212","endPage":"213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO antenna with Wi-Fi and Blue-Tooth for smart watch applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO antenna with Wi-Fi and Blue-Tooth for smart watch applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303852/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15556345","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7303852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO antenna with Wi-Fi and Blue-Tooth for smart watch applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"87WPos13109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057364S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7297713","isNumber":"7303738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7297713","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7303738","articleId":"7303852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7303876,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Polyak","affiliation":["Blavatnik School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Adam Polyak, received the bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and mathematics from BarIlan University as part of the program for mathematically talented youth, and the master\u2019s (Hons.)

Deep learning approaches pose a unique challenge: while such architectures dominate the field of face recognition with regard to accuracy, they require elaborate, multi-stage computations. Recently, there has been some work on compressing networks for the purpose of reducing run time and network size. However, it is not clear that these compression methods would work in deep face nets, which are, generally speaking, less redundant than the object recognition networks, i.e., they are already relatively lean. We propose two novel methods for compression: one based on eliminating lowly active channels and the other on coupling pruning with repeated use of already computed elements. Pruning of entire channels is an appealing idea, since it leads to direct saving in run time in almost every reasonable architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2494536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

A dynamic node-selfishness model is designed to formulate the variation of the RN's degree of node-selfishness (DeNS) with both its own resource and the incentive controlled by the source. When the node-selfishness dynamics are unknown, using the neural network (NN), we further identify the node-selfishness model and then approximate the optimal incentives for maximizing the infinite-horizon utility, namely the tradeoff between the path reliability and the incentive cost in the long term.

Furthermore, the architecture must be modular, scalable and easy to adapt to the needs of different applications. Keeping this in mind, a hybrid SIMD/MIMD architecture for embedded computer vision is proposed. It consists of a coprocessor designed to provide fast and flexible computation of demanding image processing tasks of vision applications.

Instead of using a single pulse shape function for all subcarriers, multiple functions are considered in order to maximize the time-frequency containment of the OFDM waveform. The main strategy is to concentrate the spectrum of windowing functions into a given bandwidth while achieving maximum suppression in the out-of-band region. This is achieved by employing prolate-based windowing functions which give optimal spectral concentration for time-limited pulse shapes. The windowing functions are designed per-subcarrier basis in order to exploit available concentration band for each subcarrier. In addition, the proposed concept is considered for the receive filtering in the presence of ACI. It is shown that the optimal spectral concentration property also maximizes ACI rejection for OFDM receivers.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07303911.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","startPage":"4977","endPage":"4989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Windowing Technique for Optimal Time-Frequency Concentration and ACI Rejection in OFDM-Based Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Windowing Technique for Optimal Time-Frequency Concentration and ACI Rejection in OFDM-Based Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677248","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7303911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"InterDigital Communications Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Windowing Technique for Optimal Time-Frequency Concentration and ACI Rejection in OFDM-Based Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-guvenkaya-2494048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073667S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7303911","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7303915,"authors":[{"name":"Ilaria Catapano","affiliation":["National Research Council of Italy (CNR)\u2014Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA), Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Ilaria","lastName":"Catapano","id":"37398874100"},{"name":"Francesco Soldovieri","affiliation":["National Research Council of Italy (CNR)\u2014Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA), Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Soldovieri","id":"37273864500"},{"name":"Giovanni Alli","affiliation":["IDS\u2014Ingegneria Dei Sistemi S.p.a, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Alli","id":"37274010800"},{"name":"Gaetano Mollo","affiliation":["IDS\u2014Ingegneria Dei Sistemi S.p.a, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Gaetano","lastName":"Mollo","id":"37085652512"},{"name":"Luca Antonio Forte","affiliation":["IDS\u2014Ingegneria Dei Sistemi S.p.a, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca Antonio","lastName":"Forte","id":"37085762121"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"7303915","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Image reconstruction","Inverse problems","Tomography","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","optical transfer function","Rayleigh scattering","signal reconstruction","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard beamforming","linear inverse scattering approach","resolution limits","Rayleigh criterion","point spread function","through-the-wall radar prototype","IDS","Ingegneria dei Sistemi S.p.a","microwave tomographic approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming (BF)","linear inverse scattering approach","microwave tomography (MWT)","resolution limits"]},{"kwd":["Beamforming (BF)","linear inverse scattering approach","microwave tomography (MWT)","resolution limits"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Reconstruction Capabilities of Beamforming and a Microwave Tomographic Approach","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2015.2476514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327291","endPage":"2373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7327291/07303915.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2015.2476514","startPage":"2369","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303915","abstract":"This letter aims at comparing the reconstruction capabilities of standard beamforming and a linear inverse scattering approach.

A \u201cfull\u201d MIMO scheme with transmitters (TX) precoding and receivers (RX) decoding is considered. It is shown, under assumption of high order OFDM and frequency selective channel, that the ratio between the useful signal and the nonlinear distortions is proportional to the number of TX antennas, i.e., the influence of the nonlinear distortions decreases as the number of TX antennas increases. The distortion reduction factor (DRF) is proposed as a performance metric for MIMO-OFDM systems with nonlinear PAs. A general formula for signal to distortion and noise ratio is obtained for the nonlinear PA with memory, described by the Wiener-Hammerstein (WH) model. Special cases of MIMO, such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and maximum ratio combining (MRC), are considered. A full agreement between the theoretical and simulation results is obtained. The main contribution of this paper is in a statement that TX processing reduces the effect of nonlinear distortions. This is obtained by novel approach for analysis of the MIMO-OFDM systems with nonlinear PAs with memory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07303917.pdf","startPage":"4894","endPage":"4904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO\u2013OFDM With Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear distortion","MIMO","OFDM","Frequency-domain analysis","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","nonlinear distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear distortions","MRC","maximum ratio combining","MRT","maximum ratio transmission","Wiener-Hammerstein model","DRF","distortion reduction factor","TX antennas","frequency selective channel","receiver decoding","transmitter precoding","nonlinear power amplifiers","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","SVD","MIMO","Beamforming","MRT, MRC","Nonlinear Power Amplifier","Power Amplifier with Memory"]},{"kwd":["OFDM","SVD","MIMO","Beamforming","MRT","MRC","Nonlinear Power Amplifier","Power Amplifier with Memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"MIMO\u2013OFDM With Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7303917/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677219","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO\u2013OFDM With Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-iofedov-2494018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185271S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7303917","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7303920,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Xiang","affiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.R., China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7534965/7303920/xiang-2493548-small.gif","p":["Dong Xiang received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from\n Chongqing University in 1987 and 1990, respectively.

The NOC can be used to test the embedded cores in such SOCs, whereby the added cost of dedicated test-access hardware can be avoided. However, a potential problem associated with 3D NOC-based test access is the emergence of hotspots due to stacking and the high toggle rates associated with structural test patterns used for manufacturing test. High temperatures and hotspots can lead to the failure of good parts, resulting in yield loss. We describe a unicast-based multicast approach and a thermal-driven test scheduling method to avoid hotspots, whereby the full NOC bandwidth is used to deliver test packets. Test delivery is carried out using a new unicast-based multicast scheme. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing test time under thermal constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2493548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7534965/07303920.pdf","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2493548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7534965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicast-Based Testing and Thermal-Aware Test Scheduling for 3D ICs with a Stacked Network-on-Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Multicast-Based Testing and Thermal-Aware Test Scheduling for 3D ICs with a Stacked Network-on-Chip","volume":"65","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16207467","htmlLink":"/document/7303920/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"60910003, 61170063 and 61373021"},{"fundingName":"Education Ministry","grantNumber":"20111081042"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicast-Based Testing and Thermal-Aware Test Scheduling for 3D ICs with a Stacked Network-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tc-xiang-2493548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156688S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7534965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7534965","articleId":"7303920","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7303925,"authors":[{"name":"Tiep M.

In particular, cooperative beamforming and user selection techniques are applied to protect the confidential message. The secrecy rate (SR) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the network are investigated first, and a tight upper bound for the SR and an exact formula for the SOP are derived. Next, asymptotic approximations for the SR and SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are derived for two different schemes: 1) cooperative beamforming and 2) multiuser selection. Furthermore, a new concept of cooperative diversity gain, namely, adapted cooperative diversity gain (ACDG), which can be used to evaluate the security level of a cooperative relaying network, is investigated. It is shown that the ACDG of cooperative beamforming is equal to the conventional cooperative diversity gain of traditional multiple-input single-output networks, while the ACDG of the multiuser scenario is equal to that of traditional single-input multiple-output networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2494012","startPage":"5039","endPage":"5051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07303925.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Beamforming and User Selection for Improving the Security of Relay-Aided Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Beamforming and User Selection for Improving the Security of Relay-Aided Systems","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677251","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7303925/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415\\14\\22"},{"fundingName":"Newton Institutional Link","grantNumber":"172719890"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-1435778"},{"fundingName":"IEEE Global Communications Conference"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Beamforming and User Selection for Improving the Security of Relay-Aided Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hoang-2494012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114675S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7303925","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7303927,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding at Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598328500"},{"name":"Weijian Liu","affiliation":["Wuhan Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240032500"},{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding at Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37065178000"},{"name":"Hongwei Liu","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding at Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292094700"},{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Li","id":"37281093000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7303927","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303927","abstract":"Our aim in this work is to analyze the detection performance of a constant false alarm rata matched filter (CFAR-MF) which was developed for the detection problem in white Gaussian noise with unknown noise power.

Three approximate subtractor cells are utilized for integer subtraction as basic step of division; these cells tend to mitigate accuracy in subtraction with other metrics, such as circuit complexity and power dissipation. At array level, exact cells are either replaced or truncated in the approximate divider designs. A comprehensive evaluation of approximation at both cell- and array (divider) levels is pursued using error analysis and HSPICE simulation; different circuit metrics including complexity and power dissipation are evaluated. Different applications are investigated by utilizing the proposed approximate arithmetic circuits. The simulation results show that with extensive savings for power dissipation and circuit complexity, the proposed designs offer better error tolerant capabilities for quotient oriented applications (image processing) than remainder oriented application (modulo operations). The proposed approximate restoring divider is significantly better than the approximate non-restoring scheme presented in the technical literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303928/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","volume":"65","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16138941","dateOfInsertion":"07 July 2016","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7303928/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Approximate Restoring Dividers for Error-Tolerant Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Approximate Restoring Dividers for Error-Tolerant Applications","sourcePdf":"tc-lombardi-2494005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090949S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7506354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7506354","articleId":"7303928","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7303929,"authors":[{"name":"Honglan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada"],"firstName":"Honglan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085812196"},{"name":"Jie Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Han","id":"37556260600"},{"name":"Fei Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37272195200"},{"name":"Fabrizio Lombardi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Lombardi","id":"37279999000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"7303929","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3154},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Approximation methods","Delays","Accuracy","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Error compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiplier","approximate computing","radix-8","Wallace tree","truncation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303929","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7506354/07303929.pdf","startPage":"2638","endPage":"2644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2015.2493547","doi":"10.1109/TC.2015.2493547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7506354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Radix-8 Booth Multipliers for Low-Power and High-Performance Operation","abstract":"The Booth multiplier has been widely used for high performance signed multiplication by encoding and thereby reducing the number of partial products.

Rapid advances in biomedical sensors, low-power electronics, and wireless communications have brought this vision to the verge of reality. However, key challenges still remain to be addressed. The constrained sizes of IWMDs imply that they are designed with very limited processing, storage, and battery capacities. Therefore, there is a very strong need for efficiency in data collection, analysis, storage, and communication. In this paper, we first quantify the energy and storage requirements of a continuous personal health monitoring system that uses eight biomedical sensors: (1) heart rate, (2) blood pressure, (3) oxygen saturation, (4) body temperature, (5) blood glucose, (6) accelerometer, (7) electrocardiogram (ECG), and (8) electroencephalogram (EEG). Our analysis suggests that there exists a significant gap between the energy and storage requirements for long-term continuous monitoring and the capabilities of current devices. To enable energy-efficient continuous health monitoring, we propose schemes for sample aggregation, anomaly-driven transmission, and compressive sensing to reduce the overheads of wirelessly transmitting, storing, and encrypting/authenticating the data. We evaluate these techniques and demonstrate that they result in two to three orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy and storage requirements, and can help realize the potential of long-term continuous health monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2494021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2494021","startPage":"85","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7352396/07303932.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Long-term Continuous Personal Health Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Long-term Continuous Personal Health Monitoring","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15869807","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7303932/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1219570"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Long-term Continuous Personal Health Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tmscs-mozaffarikermani-2494021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150796S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7352396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7352396","articleId":"7303932","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7303933,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Li","affiliation":["College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7422867/7303933/li-small.gif","p":["Xiaohui Li received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from\n the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009.

To solve the complex navigation problem, we adopt a hierarchical motion planning framework. First, a rough reference path is extracted from the digital map using commands from the high-level behavioral planner. The conjugate gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm and the cubic B-spline curve are employed to smoothen and interpolate the reference path sequentially. To follow the refined reference path as well as handle both static and moving objects, the trajectory planning task is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal planning problems within the curvilinear coordinate framework. A rich set of kinematically feasible path candidates are generated to deal with the dynamic traffic both deliberatively and reactively. In the meanwhile, the velocity profile generation is performed to improve driving safety and comfort. After that, the generated trajectories are carefully evaluated by an objective function, which combines behavioral decisions by reasoning about the traffic situations. The optimal collision-free, smooth, and dynamically feasible trajectory is selected and transformed into commands executed by the low-level lateral and longitudinal controllers. Field experiments have been carried out with our test autonomous vehicle on the realistic inner-city roads. The experimental results demonstrated capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory planning framework and algorithms to safely handle a variety of typical driving scenarios, such as static and moving objects avoidance, lane keeping, and vehicle following, while respecting the traffic rules.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2015.2493980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2015.2493980","startPage":"740","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7422867/07303933.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Urban Driving: Framework, Algorithms, and Verifications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Urban Driving: Framework, Algorithms, and Verifications","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15822993","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7303933/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"90820302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Urban Driving: Framework, Algorithms, and Verifications","sourcePdf":"tmech-li-2493980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165012S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7422867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"7422867","articleId":"7303933","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7303934,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed A.

Moreover, the active-large vectors in the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\alpha\\beta$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n plane are active-small vectors in the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$xy$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n plane, and vice versa.

Hence, the event-to-sink communication and the dynamic radio environment require a coordination scheme in CRSNs. In this paper, we propose a spectrum-aware clustering protocol to address the event-to-sink communication coordination issue in mobile CRSNs. Our clustering scheme consists of two phases. The first phase is the determination of nodes eligible for clustering, and the second phase is to form clusters among those nodes according to vacant spectrum bands. Clusters are temporary and they are not preserved after the end of events. Furthermore, we find average re-clustering probability, expected cluster coverage area, and find maximum event generation frequency for energy-efficient operation of our protocol. We study performance of our protocol in terms of control and data packet exchange, time steps required for clustering, connectivity of clusters, energy consumed for clustering, and re-clustering ratio due to the mobility. Performance comparison simulations show that our algorithm has better performance in terms of connectivity and energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","volume":"15","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"16191280","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7303936/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Event-to-Sink Spectrum-Aware Clustering in Mobile Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey","grantNumber":"#110E249"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-to-Sink Spectrum-Aware Clustering in Mobile Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-ozger-2493526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084822S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7530934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7530934","articleId":"7303936","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7303941,"authors":[{"name":"Anju P.

System distributed control is scheduled as the primary control. Battery energy storages (BESs) operate in voltage regulation mode with droop control for power sharing. However, bus voltage deviation and power tracking error due to line impedance are the main drawbacks of distributed control. To enhance the system power quality and control accuracy, bus voltage restoration and power sharing compensation are implemented in secondary control. Economic dispatch based on comparison of system units' marginal operation costs is carried out in tertiary control to minimize the system operation cost. Detailed elaboration has been derived to quantify BES utilization cost due to the cumulated lifetime degradation. In case of communication failure, system operation can still be retained with primary control without operating mode change so that to enhance system reliability. A lab scale dc microgrid is developed for the verification of the proposed multi-level EMS and relevant control techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7410138/07303942.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2015.2488639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2015.2488639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Level Energy Management System for Real-Time Scheduling of DC Microgrids With Multiple Slack Terminals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Threshold voltage","Microgrids","Energy management","Control systems","Real-time systems","Systems operation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","distributed power generation","energy management systems","power generation control","power generation dispatch","power generation economics","power generation reliability","power generation scheduling","power supply quality","power system restoration","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel EMS","system operation cost minimization","economic dispatch","power sharing compensation","bus voltage restoration","power tracking error","power sharing","droop control","voltage regulation mode","BES","battery energy storage","distributed control","system reliability","power quality","EMS","multiple slack terminal","DC microgrid real-time scheduling","multilevel energy management system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC microgrid","economic dispatch","multi-level EMS","multiple slack terminals","marginal cost"]},{"kwd":["DC microgrid","economic dispatch","multi-level EMS","multiple slack terminals","marginal cost"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Level Energy Management System for Real-Time Scheduling of DC Microgrids With Multiple Slack Terminals","volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7303942/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15787053","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"project Adaptive Integrated Hybrid DC-AC Micro Power Parks System","grantNumber":"M4094016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University (ERI@N), Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Level Energy Management System for Real-Time Scheduling of DC Microgrids With Multiple Slack Terminals","sourcePdf":"tec-xiao-2488639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077564S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7410138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7410138","articleId":"7303942","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7303945,"authors":[{"name":"Xian-Ming Zhang","affiliation":["Griffith School of Engineering, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7744634/7303945/zhang-2487420-small.gif","p":["Xian-Ming Zhang received the M.S. degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 1992 and 2006, respectively.","In 1992, he joined Central South University, where he was an Associate Professor with the School of Mathematics and Statistics.

Depending on these different physical properties, the entries of the system outputs are grouped into multiple nodes. A number of sensors are used to sample the signals from different nodes. A decentralized event-triggering scheme is introduced to select those necessary sampled-data packets to be transmitted so that communication resources can be saved significantly while preserving the prescribed closed-loop performance. First, in order to organize the decentralized data packets transmitted from the sensor nodes, a data packet processor (DPP) is used to generate a new signal to be held by the zero-order-hold once the signal stored by the DPP is updated at some time instant. Second, under the mechanism of the DPP, the resulting closed-loop system is modeled as a linear system with an interval time-varying delay. A sufficient condition is derived such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and strictly (Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n, S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n, R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n)-dissipative, where Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n, S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n, and R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n are real matrices of appropriate dimensions with Q\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n and R\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n symmetric.

However, considerably new developments have resulted in the last decade of the 20th century and the beginning of this century, leading to an authoritative survey of the asymmetrical six-phase drive control and subsequently of the review of the complete area. This also initiated the organization and subsequent publication of the first IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics \"Special Section on Multiphase Machines and Drives\" in May 2008, which commenced with another survey paper, and that contained 12 original research papers. Since the publication of this Special Section in May 2008, the level of interest and pace of developments in the area have further accelerated and substantial new knowledge has been generatedwith an ever-increasing number of published research papers and reported new industrial applications. Such a trend has been emphasized in a recent paper. It therefore seemed appropriate to revisit the area and organize this Special Section as a sequel to the first one. The call for the Special Section papers resulted in 51 submissions, almost twice as many as the total back in 2008, thus confirming a substantial growth of the area. Indeed, the amount of new knowledge acquired since the publication of the first Special Section in 2008 has meant that it was not possible to provide a complete and thorough survey of the field in a single review paper.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2493510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7352402/07303950.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2493510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiphase machines and drives - Revisited","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303950/","displayDocTitle":"Multiphase machines and drives - Revisited","volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7303950/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiphase machines and drives - Revisited","sourcePdf":"tie-levi-2493510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051894S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7303950","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7303956,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier received her degree (Dipl\u00f4me) in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2000 from the University of Geneva, CH.

Compared with the conventional two-stage design, the HESS can be incorporated into the traction inverter system, leading to better performance and lower cost. The UC energy can be effectively utilized due to the buck/boost characteristic in the Z-source converter; meanwhile, the battery converter gets eliminated in this case. The assumption about the symmetry in the Z-source topology impendence network states for the conventional analysis no longer applies to the proposed HESS configuration. The asymmetric characteristic related with the uneven power distribution of UCs and battery is mathematically excavated in detail. The frequency dividing coordinated control is proposed to exploit the advantages of UCs and battery. The battery peak current estimation is then investigated. Finally, the steady performance and transient response in both traction and regenerative modes are verified by simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2493528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7499899/07303963.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2493528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7499899","startPage":"7489","endPage":"7498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultracapacitor-Battery Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on the Asymmetric Bidirectional <i>Z </i>-Source Topology for EV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultracapacitor-Battery Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on the Asymmetric Bidirectional <i>Z </i>-Source Topology for EV","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16105210","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7303963/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51361130150 and 51407159"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2014QNA4012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultracapacitor-Battery Hybrid Energy Storage System Based on the Asymmetric Bidirectional <italic>Z </italic>-Source Topology for EV","sourcePdf":"tpel-hu-2493528-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099693S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7499899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7499899","articleId":"7303963","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7303965,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7303965/honli-2493546-small.gif","p":["Hongxiang Li (S\u201904\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201909) received the B.S. degree from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, the M.S. degree from Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, in 2000, 2004, and 2008, respectively, all in electrical engineering.

On the other hand, to provide multilevel services, the widely adopted scalable video coding (SVC) prioritizes a video bit stream into a base layer and several enhancement layers. In this paper, we combine SVC with the transmission delay constraint and focus on multicasting hard deadline constrained prioritized (HDCP) data over wireless erasure channels. Specifically, we first define the performance metric and formulate the optimization problem. Then, we focus on a new adaptive RNC encoding and scheduling scheme to maximize the effective network throughput. Particularly, we propose simple and efficient greedy scheduling technique, which not only obtains near-optimal performance with low-time complexity but also suits time-varying fading channels. In addition, we extend our discussion to the more practical scenario with erroneous feedback and propose sampling-based feedback mechanism to reduce the system overhead. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07303965.pdf","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2493546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2493546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7303965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Schemes for Multicasting Hard Deadline Constrained Prioritized Data in Wireless Multimedia Streaming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Wireless communication","Streaming media","Throughput","Multimedia communication","Encoding","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scheduling","media streaming","multicast communication","network coding","random codes","telecommunication scheduling","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard deadline constrained data transmission","prioritized data transmission","wireless multimedia streaming","multicast multimedia streaming","scalable video coding","video bit stream","transmission delay constraint","wireless erasure channel","adaptive RNC encoding","greedy scheduling technique","near optimal scheduling technique","time varying fading channel","random network coding","adaptive scheduling","multicasting data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicast","hard deadline","prioritized data","adaptive scheduling","random network coding"]},{"kwd":["Multicast","hard deadline","prioritized data","adaptive scheduling","random network coding"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7428982/7303965-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Schemes for Multicasting Hard Deadline Constrained Prioritized Data in Wireless Multimedia Streaming","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7303965/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837536","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1509047"},{"fundingName":"NASA KY EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Development Grant (RIDG)"},{"fundingName":"Kentucky Science and Engineering Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Transmission Schemes for Multicasting Hard Deadline Constrained Prioritized Data in Wireless Multimedia Streaming","sourcePdf":"twc-li-2493546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13149S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7303965","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7303979,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Benatti","affiliation":["Micrel Lab., Unversity of Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7337496/7303979/7303979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simone Benatti (S\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. in 2004.","From 2005 to 2012, he worked as a HW/FW Designer for a biomedical company.

In this paper, we present an embedded solution for real-time EMG-based hand gesture recognition. The work focuses on the multi-level design of the system, integrating the hardware and software components to develop a wearable device capable of acquiring and processing EMG signals for real-time gesture recognition. The system combines the accuracy of a custom analog front end with the flexibility of a low power and high performance microcontroller for on-board processing. Our system achieves the same accuracy of high-end and more expensive active EMG sensors used in applications with strict requirements on signal quality. At the same time, due to its flexible configuration, it can be compared to the few wearable platforms designed for EMG gesture recognition available on market. We demonstrate that we reach similar or better performance while embedding the gesture recognition on board, with the benefit of cost reduction. To validate this approach, we collected a dataset of 7 gestures from 4 users, which were used to evaluate the impact of the number of EMG channels, the number of recognized gestures and the data rate on the recognition accuracy and on the computational demand of the classifier. As a result, we implemented a SVM recognition algorithm capable of real-time performance on the proposed wearable platform, achieving a classification rate of 90%, which is aligned with the state-of-the-art off-line results and a 29.7 mW power consumption, guaranteeing 44 hours of continuous operation with a 400 mAh battery.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"9","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15618381","pubMedId":"26513799","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7303979/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Versatile Embedded Platform for EMG Acquisition and Gesture Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Versatile Embedded Platform for EMG Acquisition and Gesture Recognition","sourcePdf":"tbcas-benatti-2476555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142903S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7337496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"7337496","articleId":"7303979","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7303981,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Radiation and Sensing Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/7334623/7303981/7303981-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Liu received the B.E. degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011.

By taking the cross-range range coupling term into account, which is usually neglected in some fast algorithm, such as the enhanced phase shift migration (EPSM), the focusing depth for image reconstruction is greatly improved in the proposed fast algorithm. To deal with the cross-range range coupling term, a wavenumber scaling operator (WSO) was developed in the proposed algorithm which only uses chirp multiplications and FFTs with high computation efficiency and free of interpolation. Theoretical analysis on the relationship of the WSO parameters to the resulted maximum non-ambiguous range in holography image reconstruction was carried out with a quantitative criterion derived to appropriately determine the WSO parameters. Simulation results validate the proposed focusing algorithm and indicate that 3D WSA offers almost the same focusing capabilities as the most rigid phase shift migration (PSM) algorithm, meanwhile with computation efficiency greatly improved. Proof-of-principle experiments in 0.2 THz band were also performed based on a monostatic prototype imager. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the 3D WSA proposed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7303981/","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7303981/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15615663","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Three-Dimensional Image Reconstruction With Large Depth of Focus Under the Illumination of Terahertz Gaussian Beams by Using Wavenumber Scaling Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11174280"},{"fundingName":"Knowledge Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"YYYJ-1123"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Three-Dimensional Image Reconstruction With Large Depth of Focus Under the Illumination of Terahertz Gaussian Beams by Using Wavenumber Scaling Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tthz-li-2477608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096383S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"7334623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7334623","articleId":"7303981","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7304355,"authors":[{"name":"Raf Appeltans","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium","KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Raf","lastName":"Appeltans","id":"37589459100"},{"name":"Stefan Cosemans","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Cosemans","id":"37572970500"},{"name":"Praveen Raghavan","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37411797200"},{"name":"Diederik Verkest","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Diederik","lastName":"Verkest","id":"38332161600"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre"},{"name":"Wim Dehaene","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Dehaene","id":"37271994200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6688-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6687-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7304355","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304355","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Microprocessors","Magnetic tunneling","Arrays","Transistors","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","energy consumption","low-power electronics","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial source line planes","series resistance","copper layers","source line resistance","embedded memory array","energy consumption","STT-MRAM cell design","magnetoresistance random access memory","spin torque transfer","Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STT-MRAM","partial source line plane","series resistance","area","10 nm finFET"]}],"abstract":"The series resistance of STT-MRAM cells becomes increasingly important in deeply scaled nodes. Next to the typical scaling of width and thickness of the copper layers, barriers further reduce the cross-section of the actual copper. Moreover, at these small sizes, the resistivity of copper degrades compared to bulk copper. This paper presents a novel STT-MRAM cell design with partial source line planes, which improves the tradeoff between area and source line resistance. A single source line is shared among multiple bit line rows of the embedded memory array, resulting in a smaller cell area at the same source line resistance or a reduced resistance at the same area. The design with a partial source line plane shared among 4 bit line rows results in an area reduction of 11% at the same source line resistance. Alternatively, at the same area, the source line resistance is reduced by more than a factor of 4. The reduced series resistance of the cell results in a performance gain and a reduction of energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304355","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304355.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STT-MRAM cell design with partial source line planes: improving the trade-off between area and series resistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"STT-MRAM cell design with partial source line planes: improving the trade-off between area and series resistance","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7304355/","accessionNumber":"15568842","publicationDate":"August 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STT-MRAM cell design with partial source line planes: improving the trade-off between area and series resistance","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"10_Appeltans.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051154S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7304357,"authors":[{"name":"Yongpan Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongpan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292036600"},{"name":"Fang Suy","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Suy"},{"name":"Zhibo Wangy","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhibo","lastName":"Wangy"},{"name":"Huazhong Yang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huazhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085350172"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6688-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6687-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7304357","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"abstract":"Leakage power consumption has become a critical limitation in the normally off low-power systems. Power gating provides a promising solution to reduce leakage energy but cannot avoid data loss. Nonvolatile processor has paved the way to achieve zero leakage power while maintaining data. However, nonvolatile processor faces severe inrush current problem when all nonvolatile memories are backed up in parallel. A large inrush current will occur and induce IR drop, which deteriorates the stability of the entire system. This paper proposes a distributed backup control architecture for nonvolatile processors to cope with the inrush current problem. Furthermore, we devise corresponding algorithms to accelerate backup operations under given maximum tolerable current constraints. The proposed techniques are evaluated on a simulation platform and a prototype chip. Experimental results demonstrate up to 26.3% reduction in backup time compared with the sequential backup strategy under the same inrush current constraint.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304357.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design exploration of inrush current aware controller for nonvolatile processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surges","Nonvolatile memory","Benchmark testing","Prediction algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Scheduling algorithms","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","distributed control","electric current control","memory architecture","power consumption","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inrush current aware controller design","nonvolatile processor","leakage power consumption","low-power systems","power gating","leakage energy reduction","data loss","nonvolatile memory","IR drop","distributed backup control architecture","maximum tolerable current constraints","sequential backup strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design exploration of inrush current aware controller for nonvolatile processor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7304357/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15558319","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design exploration of inrush current aware controller for nonvolatile processor","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"12_Invited_PID3833169_Liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066616S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7304359,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeyong Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeyong","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37085761663"},{"name":"Youngsun Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Youngsun","lastName":"Song","id":"37085758852"},{"name":"Jihong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea"],"firstName":"Jihong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281199600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6688-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6687-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7304359","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"abstract":"Although NAND flash memory is known as a nonvolatile memory device, the non-volatility of the data stored in the NAND flash memory is guaranteed only for a specified retention time. Since the NAND retention time assumes specific operation conditions, when the NAND flash memory is exposed to an abnormal environment beyond the specified operation conditions, stored data cannot be reliably retrieved due to retention failures. In this paper, we propose a novel data recovery technique, called FlashDefibrillator (FD), for recovering retention failures in recent NAND flash memory. By reversely exploiting charge-transient behavior observed in recent 20-nm node (or below) NAND flash memory, FD can identify retention-failed cells in a progressive fashion using a novel selective error-correction procedure. FD repeatedly applies the selective error-correction procedure until retention failures are fully recovered. Our measurement results with recent 20-nm node NAND chips show that FD outperforms the existing recovery technique in both the data recovery speed and the data recovery capability. FD can recover retention failures up to 23 times faster over the existing data recovery technique. Furthermore, FD can successfully recover severely retention-failed data (such as ones experienced eight times longer retention times than the retention-time specification) which were not recoverable with the existing technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Semiconductor device measurement","Error correction codes","Pulse measurements","Logic gates","Memory management","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","integrated memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Flashdefibrillator","data recovery technique","retention failures","NAND flash memory","nonvolatile memory device","retention failed cell identification","NAND chips"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304359","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304359","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304359.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304359","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flashdefibrillator: a data recovery technique for retention failures in NAND flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flashdefibrillator: a data recovery technique for retention failures in NAND flash memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304359/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7304359/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15558324","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flashdefibrillator: a data recovery technique for retention failures in NAND flash memory","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"14_Jeong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069418S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7304360,"authors":[{"name":"Chundong Wang","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chundong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085673596"},{"name":"Qingsong Wei","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qingsong","lastName":"Wei","id":"37604257500"},{"name":"Mingdi Xue","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mingdi","lastName":"Xue","id":"37085657787"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085665671"},{"name":"Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, Singapore"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37071367800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6688-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6687-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7304360","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Data transfer","Forecasting","Performance evaluation","Clustering algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","pattern clustering","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-centric garbage collection","NAND flash devices","DIG","update intervals","clustering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304360","abstract":"Garbage collection has been concerned for NAND flash devices for years.

software-defined fusion storage system for PCM and NAND flash","abstract":"In SSD-based storage systems, persistent data are stored in the NAND Flash and however manipulated in DRAM, causing the decoupled inefficiency. The data being closer to the processors are much easier to be lost due to the volatile property of DRAM, leading to serious data reliability problems. In the meantime, existing SSD technology exploits the properties of NAND Flash and leverages NAND Flash + controller + FTL architecture to improve system's performance. In this black-box-modeled structure, the data semantic information is hard to be transferred by conventional interface. Hence the SSD firmware fails to make full use of the performance potential of SSD in terms of the semantic information of data. Moreover, the host can't obtain physical characteristics and statistical information about SSD, failing to be used by the file system or I/O scheduling algorithm designed for the disks. In order to address these problems, we propose a software defined fusion storage system for PCM and NAND Flash. PCM can be defined as the same level storage or as a buffer of NAND Flash to reduce the WA (Write Amplification) of Flash and improve reliability. In this system, we expose the channels, erases counts and data distribution of PCM/NAND Flash to the host, design FTL algorithm close to file system to obtain more semantic information of data accessing, and manage the storage device as a non-transparent structure. To achieve these design goals, we implement a Host Fusion Storage Layer (HFSL) that supports flexible I/O schedule algorithm and address mapping of variable allocation size in the persistent superior performance of SSD. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15558326","htmlLink":"/document/7304361/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A software-defined fusion storage system for PCM and NAND flash","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A software-defined fusion storage system for PCM and NAND flash","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"16_Li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061619S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7304363,"authors":[{"name":"Ye-Jyun Lin","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ye-Jyun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37068283000"},{"name":"Chia-Lin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279097400"},{"name":"Hsiang-Pang Li","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Pang","lastName":"Li","id":"37072955000"},{"name":"Cheng-Yuan Michael Wang","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Emerging System Lab., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yuan Michael","lastName":"Wang","id":"38466368700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6688-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6687-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7304363","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Random access memory","Buffer storage","Smart phones","Time factors","Ash","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","phase change memories","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dirty block writeback overhead","PCM write limitation","background flush","sub-dirty-block management","hierarchical buffer cache architecture","PCM last-level buffer cache","DRAM first-level buffer cache","hybrid DRAM-PCM memory","synchronous writes","smartphones","I-O blocks","mobile phones","flash memory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304363.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A buffer cache architecture for smartphones with hybrid DRAM/PCM memory","abstract":"Flash memory is widely used in mobile phones to store contact information, applications files and other types of data. In an operating system, the buffer cache keeps the I/O blocks in DRAM to reduce the slow flash accesses. However, in smartphones, the benefits of buffer cache are reduced due to the bulk of synchronous writes of applications for reliability issues. In this paper, we propose a buffer cache architecture with hybrid DRAM/PCM memory, which improves the I/O performance for smartphones. We use a DRAM first-level buffer cache to provide high buffer cache performance and a PCM last-level buffer cache to reduce the impact of frequent synchronous writes. Based on the proposed hierarchical buffer cache architecture, we propose a sub-dirty-block management and background flush to reduce the impact of the PCM write limitation and the dirty block writeback overhead, respectively. The experimental results show that with the proposed mechanisms, our hierarchical buffer cache can improve the I/O response time by 20% compared to the conventional buffer cache.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15568840","htmlLink":"/document/7304363/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A buffer cache architecture for smartphones with hybrid DRAM/PCM memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A buffer cache architecture for smartphones with hybrid DRAM/PCM memory","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"18_Invited_Yang_NVMSA2015_Final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063499S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7304370,"authors":[{"name":"Linbo Long","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Linbo","lastName":"Long","id":"37085338739"},{"name":"Duo Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402813400"},{"name":"Liangy Liang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Liangy","lastName":"Liang","id":"37088469870"},{"name":"Kan Zhong","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Kan","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37085338051"},{"name":"Xiao Zhu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085337915"},{"name":"Edwin H.-M.

A PCM cell can be dynamically programmed to be in either multiple-level cell (MLC) mode or single-level cell (SLC) mode. With this morphable feature, we can utilize the high-density of MLC and low-latency of SLC, to satisfy various memory requirements of specific applications in embedded systems. However, compared to its SLC counterpart, the lifetime of MLC is limited. In particular, a program in embedded systems usually exhibits an extremely unbalanced write pattern, which may accelerate the wear-out of MLC cells in morphable PCM. To address this issue, this paper proposes a simple and effective wear-leveling technique, named Mixer, to enhance the lifetime of morphable PCM considering the program specific features. We first build an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to produce optimal SLC/MLC partition and data allocation, to achieve a balanced write distribution in morphable PCM with low memory access cost. The basic idea is to allocate fast SLC and MLC cells for write intensive variables and other ordinary variables, respectively. We then propose a polynomial time algorithm to achieve near-optimal results. The evaluation results show that the proposed technique can effectively extend the lifetime of morphable PCM in embedded systems compared with previous work.","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304370","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304370.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mixer: software enabled wear leveling for morphable PCM in embedded systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15558331","htmlLink":"/document/7304370/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixer: software enabled wear leveling for morphable PCM in embedded systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"5_long.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07654S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7304372,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Ran","affiliation":["Spintronics Interdisciplinary Center Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Ran","id":"37085735711"},{"name":"Wang Kang","affiliation":["Spintronics Interdisciplinary Center Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Kang","id":"38238916200"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["Spintronics Interdisciplinary Center Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37082021500"},{"name":"Jacques-Olivier Klein","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique Fondamentale (IEF) Univ.

As technology scales down to nanoscale nodes, this read disturbance issue becomes more serious and may turn into be a critical reliability barrier for STT-MRAM commercialization, because the difference between the read and write currents decreases. In this paper, we propose a circuit to detect the read disturbance by exploiting its typical features, i.e., (a) the resistance (read current) of the memory cell will have a sudden change if read disturbance occurs; (b) only one-direction of read disturbance can occur during normal read operations.

With multi-bit storage capability, Multiple-Level-Cell (MLC) PCM outperforms Single-Level-Cell (SLC) in density. However, the high write latency is a performance bottleneck for MLC PCM for two reasons. First, MLC PCM has a much longer programming time. Second, the write latencies of different transitions of cell states range widely. When cells are concurrently written in burst mode, the write latency of a burst is decided by the worst one. To improve the write throughput of MLC PCM, this paper proposes a Write Reconstruction (WR) scheme. WR reconstructs multiple burst writes targeting the same row. The worst case cells are put together in some writes. By this way, the write latency of other writes will be reduced. WR incurs low implementation overhead and shows significant efficiency. Experimental results show that WR achieves 15.1% of write latency reduction on average, with negligible power overhead (3.4%).","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304373.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving MLC PCM write throughput by write reconstruction","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving MLC PCM write throughput by write reconstruction","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15558321","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7304373/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving MLC PCM write throughput by write reconstruction","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"8_luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092873S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7304374,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Bock","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pittsburgh"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Bock","id":"37391294300"},{"name":"Bruce R.

Researchers have proposed combining DRAM and non-volatile memory (NVM) in main memory to increase capacity and reduce energy consumption. Due to its architectural simplicity, software-managed hybrid memory is a promising way to incorporate NVM. However, there are significant performance issues caused by increased memory traffic due to data migration and a lack of effective migration policies. These issues can be addressed by carefully co-designing hardware-software mechanisms and migration policies. To aid in the development of new mechanisms and policies to incorporate NVM in main memory, we present HMMSim, a trace-driven simulator that allows for fast and flexible exploration of the hardware-software co-design space of hybrid main memory. HMMSim has a simple interface to connect memory hierarchy components that can be configured to simulate several memory architectures, including DRAM only, NVM only, DRAM hardware cache, and software-managed hybrid memory. We present two case studies that use HMMSim, and show that HMMSim is fast, flexible and scalable.","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304374","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory System and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295173/7304351/07304374.pdf","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2015.7304374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304374/","displayDocTitle":"HMMSim: a simulator for hardware-software co-design of hybrid main memory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7304374/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15558323","publicationDate":"August 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HMMSim: a simulator for hardware-software co-design of hybrid main memory","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"9_bock.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092248S","chronDate":"19-21 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295173","isNumber":"7304351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295173","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7304351","articleId":"7304374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7304386,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Haraz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept.

The simulated results show that the designed antenna has a dual-band function at 28/38 GHz that covers future 5G applications. The designed 1-to-4 modified Wilkinson power divider is used to feed the proposed array. For further enhancement of the designed power divider, an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures are used. The proposed antenna array provides directional patterns, relatively flat gain, and high radiation efficiency through the frequency band excluding the rejected band.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07304386.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7304386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7304386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-element dual-band printed slot antenna array for the future 5G mobile communication networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","5G mobile communication","Antenna arrays","Antenna radiation patterns","Dual band","Mobile antennas","Periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antenna arrays","microwave antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","multifrequency antennas","photonic band gap","power dividers","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-element dual-band printed slot antenna array","future fifth generation mobile networks","future 5G mobile communication networks","dual-band function","modified Wilkinson power divider","electromagnetic bandgap structures","EBG structures","directional patterns","radiation efficiency","frequency 28 GHz","frequency 38 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Four-element dual-band printed slot antenna array for the future 5G mobile communication networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7304386/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15554958","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-element dual-band printed slot antenna array for the future 5G mobile communication networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050574S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7304386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":7304387,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed T.

The MIMO antenna system consists of two, four-element arrays, each with a fixed beam direction which is electronically tilted to provide low field correlation. In particular, a passive microstrip-based feed network is designed to provide appropriate magnitude and phase excitations for beam tilting. The complete array is designed on a two-layer PCB and occupies 50 mm by 20 mm making it suitable for inclusion at the periphery of any portable device.

This is not a trivial task considering that, in general, if all antenna array elements are excited at full power (all precoding weights have amplitude 1) then a narrow antenna beam is generated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304447/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15555649","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7304447/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CRS precoding weights for wide beam coverage in FD-MIMO antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRS precoding weights for wide beam coverage in FD-MIMO antenna arrays","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032772S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7304447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7304449,"authors":[{"name":"Danyang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Technology, Minnesota State University Mankato, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Danyang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085639420"},{"name":"Xuan Hui Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Technology, Minnesota State University Mankato, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xuan Hui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281235900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7815-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7814-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7304449","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"abstract":"A single piece horizontally polarized cylindrical antenna array is designed and prototyped.

The simulation results indicate that with this technique a scanning angle of 22 degree can be achieved across the frequency band of 57-64 GHz while the reflection coefficient is below -10 dB.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7304513","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07304513.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7304513","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","startPage":"254","endPage":"255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming bow-tie antenna for millimeter-wave applications using metamaterial lens","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7304513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming bow-tie antenna for millimeter-wave applications using metamaterial lens","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7304513/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7304513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15555495","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming bow-tie antenna for millimeter-wave applications using metamaterial lens","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035281S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7304513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7304533,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiro Honda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Toyama University, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Honda","id":"37892726500"},{"name":"Toshihiko Kabeya","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Toyama University, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Kabeya","id":"37085716969"},{"name":"Kento Karitani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Toyama University, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kento","lastName":"Karitani","id":"37085705091"},{"name":"Kun Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Toyama University, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Li","id":"38667838000"},{"name":"Koichi Ogawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Toyama University, Toyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37085368286"},{"name":"Yoshio Koyanagi","affiliation":["Panasonic System Networks Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Koyanagi","id":"37278497600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Sato","affiliation":["Panasonic System Networks Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Sato","id":"38086955800"},{"name":"Ritsu Miura","affiliation":["Panasonic System Networks Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Ritsu","lastName":"Miura","id":"37085705259"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7815-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7814-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7304533","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Base stations","Uplink","MIMO","Antennas","Antenna measurements","Correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","fading channels","MIMO communication","mobile antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilateral fading emulator","MIMO-OTA testing","base station correlation","Jakes theory","spatial correlation","base station antenna","scatterers","two-dimensional channel model","handset MIMO antenna","uplink channel properties","downlink channel properties"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a bilateral fading emulator for MIMO-OTA testing with a function of controlling the correlation of base station.

The analysis is demonstrated by evaluating the proposed algorithm using three different radiation patterns obtained from \u03bb/2, 3\u03bb/2, and 5\u03bb/2 length dipole antennas.

The uptake of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) includes updating existing products, and this typically means modifying a printed circuit board (PCB) to house the updated radio chip(s), and the antennas. Modification for updated chips is relatively straightforward but adding an antenna to an already-packed PCB can be difficult because of the constraint of maintaining the existing housing and mounting arrangements. The product and design economics calls for the performance return that the retrofit diversity system will offer. Typically, the outage of the existing system is known, and the question is how much would the outage improve if a MIMO system was retrofitted. Here we present a simple solution for this problem and a design example for a machine-to-machine (M2M) system on a small PCB. The single antenna is a standard edge-mounted element. The second element of the diversity/MIMO system is a similar element mounted at a different edge - a widely-used configuration.

It also allows MIMO which makes antenna design challenging especially where the space is restricted. Here a wide band slot antenna in the shape of a modified square with dual ports is proposed. The antenna has two asymmetrical orthogonal micro-strip line feeds. One port covers the 802.11ac band with 13% fractional bandwidth while the other port is matched over a greater 26% fractional bandwidth. The slot is modified with protuberances such that the coupling between the feeds are minimized and the excitation of the modes hence the bandwidth of the feeds are controlled by the protuberances. As a result of this modification the slot size is reduced further by 22% compared to the unaltered square slot design.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7305002","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1227","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7305002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07305002.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wide band MIMO slot antenna for 5G Wi-Fi","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305002/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A wide band MIMO slot antenna for 5G Wi-Fi","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305002/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15555670","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide band MIMO slot antenna for 5G Wi-Fi","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042373S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7305002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7305003,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37539784700"},{"name":"Buon Kiong Lau","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Buon Kiong","lastName":"Lau","id":"37085424036"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7815-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7814-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7305003","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Electric fields","Specific absorption rate","Antenna measurements","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","electromagnetic wave absorption","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","telecommunication terminals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO terminal","specific absorption rate","multiantenna transmission","arbitrary power allocation","phase allocation","electric fields","time averaged simultaneous peak SAR","TASPS","exposure limit","standalone SAR distribution","antenna prototype"]}],"abstract":"Evaluating SAR for multi-antennas is difficult and impractical due to the arbitrary power allocation and phase of the electric fields from different antennas causing the total field to change randomly. In this context, a simple approach was recently proposed for assessing SAR when more than one antenna is transmitting simultaneously. The metric of time averaged simultaneous peak SAR (TASPS) was derived for the purpose of showing that only the stand-alone SAR for each antenna needs to be evaluated in order to verify if the SAR for multi-antenna transmissions also stays within the exposure limit. In this paper, we briefly review the derivation and illustrate the physical mechanism underlying this result for a two-antenna prototype using stand-alone and simultaneous SAR distributions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple assessment of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for MIMO terminals","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7305003","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07305003.pdf","startPage":"1228","endPage":"1229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7305003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Simple assessment of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for MIMO terminals","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305003/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15555740","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple assessment of Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) for MIMO terminals","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029177S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7305003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7305032,"authors":[{"name":"Shanpu Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Shanpu","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085639786"},{"name":"Ross D.

Matching between a sector-disk shaped radiating patch and the 50-\u03a9 microstrip line is manipulated through aproximity-feed technique. An elliptically shaped aperture is etched in the ground plane to enhance the antenna bandwidth. A shunt stub is used to get more enhancement of the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. To reduce the interference between the 5G system and other systems, \u03c0-shaped slot is etched off in the feed line to create a notched band of 30-34 GHz. The simulated results show that the designed antenna has a dual band function at 28/38 GHz that covers future 5G applications.

The dipoles are placed in an orthogonal manner to achieve different polarization states.

This ray-tracing model is used to study the channel characteristics and analyze the variation in received power and the channel delay profile. Furthermore, the frequency dependent atmospheric attenuation has been considered in this contribution as an important parameter affecting each path in the ray-tracing model based on the ray-path length. We succeeded to incorporate the atmospheric attenuation models of International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with the ray-tracer results. A very detailed 3D model of the office environment has been drawn up while the parameters of the common building materials were taken from literature. Simulation results based on frequency sweeping will be presented. In the full version of this paper, time domain results would be illustrated with the corresponding channel parameters such as Delay Spread (DS) and Power Delay Profile (PDP).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07305280.pdf","startPage":"1782","endPage":"1783","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7305280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7305280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahertz band: Indoor ray-tracing channel model considering atmospheric attenuation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Attenuation","Ray tracing","Atmospheric waves","Wireless communication","Mathematical model","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building materials","electromagnetic wave attenuation","indoor radio","ray tracing","synchronisation","time-domain analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PDP","power delay profile","delay spread","channel parameters","time domain","frequency sweeping","building materials","3D model","ITU","International Telecommunication Union","atmospheric attenuation models","ray-path length","channel delay profile","office environment","ray-tracing simulations","indoor ray-tracing channel model","terahertz band","frequency 100 GHz to 1000 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Terahertz band: Indoor ray-tracing channel model considering atmospheric attenuation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305280/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15555525","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terahertz band: Indoor ray-tracing channel model considering atmospheric attenuation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001782.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07079S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7305280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7305282,"authors":[{"name":"Rashid Mehmood","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, USA"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"38186197100"},{"name":"Jon W.

However, dense femtocell deployments can cause severe interference. In this paper, a FAPs' cooperation approach is proposed to solve the interference problem. In particular, for uplink transmissions, the cooperative FAPs are allowed to form a group (i.e., coalition) to optimize their sum-rate by jointly decoding their received signals, and the FAPs' cooperation problem is formulated as a coalitional game in characteristic form with transferable utility based on multiple access channel (MAC). It is demonstrated that all the FAPs can form one group (i.e., grand coalition) to maximizes their sum-rate. Moreover, the core of the grand coalition is proved to be non-empty. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms non-cooperative case in terms of the total system sum-rate and the average rate per link.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7305284","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07305284.pdf","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7305284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell cooperation based on multiple-access channel model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305284/","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell cooperation based on multiple-access channel model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15554994","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305284/","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell cooperation based on multiple-access channel model","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03819S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7305284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7305290,"authors":[{"name":"Almuttaz Mohammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Almuttaz","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37085712294"},{"name":"Soo Yong Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Soo Yong","lastName":"Lim","id":"38009033700"},{"name":"Zhengqing Yun","affiliation":["Hawaii Center for Advanced Communications, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengqing","lastName":"Yun","id":"37279601700"},{"name":"Magdy F.

In this paper, a mock city is modeled to mimic a selected site from a real city in the town of Kajang in Malaysia, which contains partially open drain structures. The mock city model is first built without the existence of the partially open drain structures to model a flat ground surface, and next modified to have the partially open drain structures inserted to portray the real scenario. These models are fed into a 3D ray tracing software for running numerical simulations in several transmitter-receiver (tx-rx) trajectories. The powers obtained from the simulations are subsequently compared for several scenarios when the said structures are absent and present. Our findings suggest that in a city where partially open drains are present, varying degree of difference in path gain can be expected for certain predefined tx-rx trajectories.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07305290.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1803","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7305290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7305290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ray tracing method for propagation prediction in a mock city with partially open drains","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cities and towns","Gain","Buildings","Ray tracing","Trajectory","Wireless communication","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiowave propagation","ray tracing","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially open drain structure","mock city model","flat ground surface","3D ray tracing software","numerical simulation","transmitter-receiver trajectory","path gain","propagation prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A ray tracing method for propagation prediction in a mock city with partially open drains","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15555080","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ray tracing method for propagation prediction in a mock city with partially open drains","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051675S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7305290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7305303,"authors":[{"name":"Woochan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Woochan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085438656"},{"name":"Dan Jiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37085445414"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7815-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7814-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7305303","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"A new method for making an explicit time-domain finite-element method (TDFEM) unconditionally stable is developed for general electromagnetic analysis.

Our optimizer deals with the three performance criteria of UWB antennas: good impedance matching from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz, constant gains in the broadside direction throughout the interested band, and little distortion between the time-domain transmitting and receiving signals. The capability of the proposed design technique is demonstrated by a compact UWB planar monopole design, and the optimized results show that the design goals are automatically achieved; therefore, the multi-objective optimization of UWB antennas can be accomplished in a more systematic way.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2015.7305359","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295716/7304376/07305359.pdf","startPage":"1940","endPage":"1941","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation & USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2015.7305359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7304376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization for UWB antennas in impedance matching, gain, and fidelity factor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization for UWB antennas in impedance matching, gain, and fidelity factor","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15555273","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7305359/","conferenceDate":"19-24 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization for UWB antennas in impedance matching, gain, and fidelity factor","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001940.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041343S","chronDate":"19-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295716","isNumber":"7304376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295716","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7304376","articleId":"7305359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7305369,"authors":[{"name":"Takafumi Fujimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37339765800"},{"name":"Junpei Taguri","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Junpei","lastName":"Taguri","id":"37085702527"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7815-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7814-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"7305369","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wideband","Broadband antennas","Antenna feeds","Correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","planar inverted-F antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband printed inverted-F antenna","MIMO system","rectangular element","feeding element","two element MIMO antenna","L-shaped slit","linear slit","correlation coefficient"]}],"abstract":"A wideband printed inverted-F antenna is proposed.

In this paper, we present a 3D-integrated CMOS/silicon-photonic optical receiver. The receiver features a low-bandwidth TIA integrating front-end double-sampling technique and dynamic offset modulation. The copper-pillar-based 3D-integration technology used here enables ultralow parasitics and 40 \u03bcm pitch for interconnection. We study different tradeoffs in designing an optical receiver and how to choose between a full-bandwidth TIA front-end and integrating architecture using a resistive front-end or a low-bandwidth TIA front-end. The design methodology is supported by measurements of two 3D-integrated prototypes based on a conventional TIA and a double-sampling integrating receiver. The proposed receiver architecture achieves -14.9 dBm of sensitivity and energy efficiency of 170 fJ/b at 25 Gb/s, while the conventional receiver achieves a sensitivity of -10.4 dBm and energy efficiency of 260 fJ/b at 21.2 Gb/s.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2494060","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7488300/07305749.pdf","startPage":"2924","endPage":"2933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7488300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2494060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 25 Gb/s 3D-Integrated CMOS/Silicon-Photonic Receiver for Low-Power High-Sensitivity Optical Communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June15, 15 2016","displayDocTitle":"A 25 Gb/s 3D-Integrated CMOS/Silicon-Photonic Receiver for Low-Power High-Sensitivity Optical Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305749/","publicationDate":"15 June15, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 June 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16073148","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305749/","volume":"34","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 25 Gb/s 3D-Integrated CMOS/Silicon-Photonic Receiver for Low-Power High-Sensitivity Optical Communication","sourcePdf":"jlt-saeedi-2494060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070886S","chronDate":"June15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7488300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7488300","articleId":"7305749","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7305753,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Salinas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mec\u00e1nica y El\u00e9ctrica, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n, San Nicol\u00e1s de Los Garza, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7305753/salin-2494535-small.gif","p":["\n\nFernando Salinas received the B.S. degree from the Universidad Nacional \nAut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Mexico City, Mexico, and the M.S. and Dr.Eng. degrees from the Universidad \nAut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n (UANL), San Nicol\u00e1s de Los Garza, Mexico.","Since 2013, he has been a Professor with the Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda Mec\u00e1nica y El\u00e9ctrica, UANL. \nHis current research interests include control of multilevel power converters in applications of electrical machines \nand power systems."]},"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Salinas","id":"37085372833"},{"name":"Mario A.

Flying capacitor multilevel converters require controlling the flying capacitor voltages and the output current. In this regard, several works have studied this problem. However, the discrete nature of the converter has not been directly included in the control design. In this paper, a hybrid representation of the converter is considered, and using Petri net (PN) methodology, a control scheme is proposed to regulate the flying capacitor voltages and the output current. An analysis of stability, using Lyapunov method, is presented, and sufficient stability conditions are obtained. From these conditions, the commutation rules are defined and used to define the transition rules for the PNs. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305753/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","accessionNumber":"15775290","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7305753/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control Design Strategy for Flying Capacitor Multilevel Converters Based on Petri Nets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CONACYT"},{"fundingName":"UANL-PAICYT"},{"fundingName":"PROMEP DSA/103.5/15/6797"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Design Strategy for Flying Capacitor Multilevel Converters Based on Petri Nets","sourcePdf":"tie-escalante-2494535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110679S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7305753","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7305762,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph K.

Specifically, in our proposed 2FA access control system, an attribute-based access control mechanism is implemented with the necessity of both a user secret key and a lightweight security device. As a user cannot access the system if they do not hold both, the mechanism can enhance the security of the system, especially in those scenarios where many users share the same computer for web-based cloud services. In addition, attribute-based control in the system also enables the cloud server to restrict the access to those users with the same set of attributes while preserving user privacy, i.e., the cloud server only knows that the user fulfills the required predicate, but has no idea on the exact identity of the user. Finally, we also carry out a simulation to demonstrate the practicability of our proposed 2FA system.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7365556/07305762.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Grained Two-Factor Access Control for Web-Based Cloud Computing Services","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7365556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Fine-Grained Two-Factor Access Control for Web-Based Cloud Computing Services","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15679032","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7305762/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472083, U1405255 and 61402110"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation","grantNumber":"141065"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian University","grantNumber":"JA14067"},{"fundingName":"Distinguished Young Scholars Fund of Fujian Province, China"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Cryptology Research Fund, China"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2014A030306020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-Grained Two-Factor Access Control for Web-Based Cloud Computing Services","sourcePdf":"tifs-au-2493983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136784S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7365556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7365556","articleId":"7305762","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7305763,"authors":[{"name":"Ramona Pelich","affiliation":["CNRS UMR 6285 LabSTICC, Institut Mines Telecom\u2013Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7419294/7305763/pelic-2487378-small.gif","p":["\n\nRamona Pelich (S'14) was born in Romania in 1987.

The analytically evaluated torque harmonic spectra, pertaining to conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM), bus-clamping PWM (BCPWM), and ABCPWM, are validated through simulation and experimental results. Theoretical and experimental studies bring out the superiority of the ABCPWM in terms of torque harmonics over CSVPWM and BCPWM. The magnitude of the dominant torque harmonic with the ABCPWM scheme is shown to be significantly lower than that with CSVPWM, over a wide range of speed. The rms torque ripple (i.e., total rms value of all harmonic torques) is lower with ABCPWM than with BCPWM over the entire range of speed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Pulse width modulation","Harmonic analysis","Clamps","Stator windings","Induction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","power conversion harmonics","PWM invertors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulsating torque","open-loop induction motor drives","vector-controlled induction motor drives","advanced bus-clamping pulsewidth modulation method","ABCPWM method","torque harmonic spectrum","voltage source inverter fed induction motor","real-time pulsewidth modulation method","real-time PWM method","torque harmonic spectra","conventional space vector PWM","CSVPWM","bus-clamping PWM","dominant torque harmonic","rms torque ripple"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced Bus Clamping PWM","Bus Clamping PWM","Discontinuous PWM","Induction Motor Drives","Pulsating Torque","Pulse Width Modulation","Space Vector","Torque Ripple"]},{"kwd":["Advanced bus-clamping pulsewidth modulation (ABCPWM)","bus-clamping PWM (BCPWM)","discontinuous PWM (DPWM)","induction motor drives","pulsating torque","PWM","space vector","torque ripple"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2494530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07305765.pdf","startPage":"1404","endPage":"1413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2494530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of Pulsating Torque Produced by Induction Motor Drives Controlled With Advanced Bus-Clamping Pulsewidth Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of Pulsating Torque Produced by Induction Motor Drives Controlled With Advanced Bus-Clamping Pulsewidth Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305765/","volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305765/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15775333","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of Pulsating Torque Produced by Induction Motor Drives Controlled With Advanced Bus-Clamping Pulsewidth Modulation","sourcePdf":"tie-hari-2494530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078328S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7305765","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7305769,"authors":[{"name":"Dekang Zhu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7386543/7305769/zhu-2474144-small.gif","p":["\n\nDekang Zhu received the B.S. degree in communications engineering from \nWuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2009 and the M.S. degree from the National University of Defense Technology, \nChangsha, China, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests lie in the area of radar target recognition."]},"firstName":"Dekang","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085684370"},{"name":"Yongxiang Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7386543/7305769/liu-2474144-small.gif","p":["\n\nYongxiang Liu (M'13) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the \nNational University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.","He has been with NUDT since 2004, where he is currently a Professor with the College of Electrical Science and \nEngineering, conducting research on radar target recognition, time-frequency analysis, and micromotions.

Two important properties of one-time random linear measurements acquired using a Gaussian independent identically distributed matrix are outlined: 1) the measurements reveal only the energy of the sensed signal and 2) only the energy of the measurements leaks information about the signal. An important consequence of the above facts is that CS provides information theoretic secrecy in a particular setting. Namely, a simple strategy based on the normalization of the Gaussian measurements achieves, at least in theory, perfect secrecy, enabling the use of CS as an additional security layer in privacy preserving applications. In the generic setting in which CS does not provide information theoretic secrecy, two alternative security notions linked to the difficulty of estimating the energy of the signal and distinguishing equal-energy signals are introduced. Useful bounds on the mean square error of any possible estimator and the probability of error of any possible detector are provided and compared with the simulations. The results indicate that CS is in general not secure according to cryptographic standards, but may provide a useful built-in data obfuscation layer.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493982","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7349121/07305773.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of One-Time Random Projections for Privacy Preserving Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305773/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of One-Time Random Projections for Privacy Preserving Compressed Sensing","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15661461","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305773/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council under the European Community\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC","grantNumber":"279848"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of One-Time Random Projections for Privacy Preserving Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tifs-bianchi-2493982-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189321S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7349121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7349121","articleId":"7305773","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7305775,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Opto-electronics Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Tianjin, China","College of Precision Instrument & Opto-electronics Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Kun Liu received the B.Eng. degree in opto-electronics information\n engineering and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in optical engineering, in 2004, 2006, and 2009, respectively, all from\n Tianjin University, Tianjin, China.","From 2009 to 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher with Tianjin University, where he is currently an Associate\n Professor with the College of Precision Instrument and Optoelectronics Engineering.

The coupling effects between both the stator and the rotor have been taken into account by the computation of stator\u2013rotor mutual inductances. The model has been developed under the MATLAB/Simulink environment in order to have a universal tool that is easy to use with any control techniques. With this model, it is possible to simulate any type of electrical faults during the motion by closing or opening corresponding switches. The performances of the model have been validated by comparing simulation and experimental results of a 90-W 14-V 50-Hz two-pole 6PIM operating with different levels of load torque in healthy and faulty modes. Furthermore, this model has been associated to a fault-tolerant speed control method in phase opening occurrences in order to test the model accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7305780/","displayDocTitle":"Six-Phase Induction Machine Model for Electrical Fault Simulation Using the Circuit-Oriented Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Six-Phase Induction Machine Model for Electrical Fault Simulation Using the Circuit-Oriented Method","sourcePdf":"tie-yazidi-2493727-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089738S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7305780","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7305783,"authors":[{"name":"Abdalla E.

The new model introduces an instantaneous-power-dependent weight function on the static and dynamic terms of the conventional memory polynomial (MP) model. Experimental validation in both modeling and predistortion contexts was performed on a PA prototype driven by a 20-MHz Long Term Evolution signal. The proposed model was assessed against the standard MP model. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed polynomial in behavioral modeling applications as it results in up to 50% (3-dB) improvement in the normalized mean square error for the same number of coefficients. The model robustness was then validated by using a second test signal applied to two Doherty PAs using different transistor technologies. Furthermore, when applied for digital predistortion, the proposed WMP function achieves the same performance as the state-of-art MP while requiring approximately 50% less coefficients.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07305783.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2494040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2494040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Weighted Memory Polynomial for Behavioral Modeling and Digital Predistortion of Nonlinear Wireless Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Predistortion","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","mean square error methods","polynomial approximation","radio transmitters","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear wireless transmitters","weighted memory polynomial","behavioral modeling","digital predistortion","radiofrequency power amplifiers","behavioral predistortion","instantaneous-power-dependent weight function","Long Term Evolution signal","normalized mean square error","second test signal","Doherty power amplifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioural modelling","digital predistortion","LTE","memory effects","memory polynomial"]},{"kwd":["Behavioral modeling","digital predistortion (DPD)","Long Term Evolution (LTE)","memory effects","memory polynomial (MP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Weighted Memory Polynomial for Behavioral Modeling and Digital Predistortion of Nonlinear Wireless Transmitters","volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7305783/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15775287","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (MAARIFAH)\u2014King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, through the Science and Technology Unit at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","grantNumber":"12-ELE3006-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Weighted Memory Polynomial for Behavioral Modeling and Digital Predistortion of Nonlinear Wireless Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tie-hammi-2494040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092627S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7305783","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7305791,"authors":[{"name":"Bart\u0142omiej B\u0142aszczyszyn","affiliation":["Inria-ENS, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Bart\u0142omiej B\u0142aszczyszyn received his PhD degree and Habilitation qualification in applied mathematics from University of Wroc\u0142aw (Poland) in 1995 and 2008, respectively.

This SINR process is completely characterized by deriving its factorial moment measures, which involve numerically tractable, explicit integral expressions. This novel framework naturally leads to expressions for the k-coverage probability, including the case of random SINR threshold values considered in multi-tier network models. While the k-coverage probabilities correspond to the marginal distributions of the order statistics of the SINR process, a more general relation is presented, connecting the factorial moment measures of the SINR process to the joint densities of these order statistics. This gives a way for calculating the exact values of the coverage probabilities arising in a general scenario of signal combination and interference cancellation between base stations. The presented framework consisting of the mathematical representations of SINR characteristics with respect to the factorial moment measures holds for the whole domain of SINR, and is amenable to considerable model extension.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studying the SINR Process of the Typical User in Poisson Networks Using Its Factorial Moment Measures","publicationTitle":"IEEE

(CNN) has demonstrated promising performance in single-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN best copes with multi-label images still remains an open problem, mainly due to the complex underlying object layouts and insufficient multi-label training images. In this work, we propose a flexible deep CNN infrastructure, called Hypotheses-CNN-Pooling (HCP), where an arbitrary number of object segment hypotheses are taken as the inputs, then a shared CNN is connected with each hypothesis, and finally the CNN output results from different hypotheses are aggregated with max pooling to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. Some unique characteristics of this flexible deep CNN infrastructure include: 1) no ground-truth bounding box information is required for training; 2) the whole HCP infrastructure is robust to possibly noisy and/or redundant hypotheses; 3) the shared CNN is flexible and can be well pre-trained with a large-scale single-label image dataset, e.g., ImageNet; and 4) it may naturally output multi-label prediction results. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 multi-label image datasets well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HCP infrastructure over other state-of-the-arts. In particular, the mAP reaches 90.5% by HCP only and 93.2% after the fusion with our complementary result in [12] based on hand-crafted features on the VOC 2012 dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16191138","pubMedId":"26513778","htmlLink":"/document/7305792/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"HCP: A Flexible CNN Framework for Multi-Label Image Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Scientific Research Project","grantNumber":"K15JB00360"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National NSF of China","grantNumber":"61210006 and 61532005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HCP: A Flexible CNN Framework for Multi-Label Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tpami-wei-2491929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107302S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7530937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"7530937","articleId":"7305792","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7305794,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajit Mohanty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7355262/7305794/mohan-2482120-small.gif","p":["\n               Satyajit Mohanty currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Institute of Technology Rourkela (NIT Rourkela), India.","His research interests include modeling and control of PV systems."]},"firstName":"Satyajit","lastName":"Mohanty","id":"37085703931"},{"name":"Bidyadhar Subudhi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7355262/7305794/subud-2482120-small.gif","p":["\n               Bidyadhar Subudhi (M94SM08) received the Ph.D. degree in control system engineering from the University of Sheffield, U.K., in 2003.","Currently, he is a Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela.

The problem of tracking the global peak (GP) of a PV array under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is attempted employing the GWO-based MPPT technique. The proposed scheme is studied for a PV array under PSCs which exhibits multiple peaks and its tracking performance is compared with that of two MPPT algorithms, namely P&O-MPPT and IPSO-MPPT. The proposed GWO-MPPT algorithm is implemented on a PV system using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Furthermore, an experimental setup is developed to verify the efficacy of the proposed system. From the obtained simulation and experimental results, it is observed that the proposed MPPT algorithm outperforms both P&O and IPSO MPPTs.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2015.2482120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7355262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2015.2482120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7355262/07305794.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New MPPT Design Using Grey Wolf Optimization Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Partial Shading Conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"A New MPPT Design Using Grey Wolf Optimization Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Partial Shading Conditions","volume":"7","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305794/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15677340","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305794/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New MPPT Design Using Grey Wolf Optimization Technique for Photovoltaic System Under Partial Shading Conditions","sourcePdf":"tste-subudhi-2482120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141736S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7355262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"276","xplore-issue":"7355262","articleId":"7305794","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7305795,"authors":[{"name":"Xavier Mestre","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7394983/7305795/7305795-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xavier Mestre (S\u201996\u2013M\u201903\u2013SM\u201909) received the M.S. and PhD. in Electrical Engineering from Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya (UPC) in 1997 and 2002 respectively and the Licenciate Degree in Mathematics in 2011 from the same University.

The proposed system seeks to approximate an ideal frequency-selective precoder and linear receiver by Taylor expansion, exploiting the structure of the analysis and synthesis filterbanks. The resulting architecture is implemented by linearly combining conventional MIMO linear transceivers, which are applied to sequential derivatives of the original filterbank. The classical per-subcarrier precoding/linear receiver configuration is obtained as a special case of this architecture, when only one stage is fixed at both transmitter and receiver. An asymptotic expression for the resulting intersymbol/intercarrier (ISI/ICI) distortion is derived assuming that the number of subcarriers grows large. This expression can in practice be used in order to determine the number of parallel stages that need to be implemented in the proposed architecture. Performance evaluation studies confirm the substantial advantage of the proposed scheme in practical frequency-selective MIMO scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7394983/07305795.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2493988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2493988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelized Structures for MIMO FBMC Under Strong Channel Frequency Selectivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Frequency modulation","Receivers","Distortion","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO FBMC transmission","parallelized structures","channel frequency selectivity","filterbank multicarrier modulated signal reception","frequency-selective precoder","Taylor expansion","MIMO linear transceivers","classical per-subcarrier precoding","linear receiver configuration","asymptotic expression","intersymbol-intercarrier distortion","ISI-ICI distortion","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Filter-bank multi-carrier modulation","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Parallelized Structures for MIMO FBMC Under Strong Channel Frequency Selectivity","volume":"64","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7305795/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15754904","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Generalitat de Catalunya","grantNumber":"2014-SGR-1567"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"ICT-318362 EMPhAtiC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"TEC2014-59255-C3-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelized Structures for MIMO FBMC Under Strong Channel Frequency Selectivity","sourcePdf":"tsp-mestre-2493988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201745S","chronDate":"March1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7394983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7394983","articleId":"7305795","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7305797,"authors":[{"name":"Rawan Naous","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/7373702/7305797/rawan-small.gif","p":["Rawan Naous (S\u201913) received the B.E. degree in electrical\n engineering from the American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in communications\n electronics (Hons.) from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany, in 2007.

The models varied in complexity ranging from a description of physical mechanisms to a more generalized mathematical modeling. Nonetheless, stochasticity, a widespread observed phenomenon, has been immensely overlooked from the modeling perspective. This inherent variability within the operation of the memristor is a vital feature for the integration of this nonlinear device into the stochastic electronics realm of study. In this paper, experimentally observed innate stochasticity is modeled in a circuit compatible format. The model proposed is generic and could be incorporated into variants of threshold-based memristor models in which apparent variations in the output hysteresis convey the switching threshold shift. Further application as a noise injection alternative paves the way for novel approaches in the fields of neuromorphic engineering circuits design. On the other hand, extra caution needs to be paid to variability intolerant digital designs based on nondeterministic memristor logic.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2015.2493960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7373702/07305797.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2015.2493960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7373702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochasticity Modeling in Memristors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Stochasticity Modeling in Memristors","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15689055","htmlLink":"/document/7305797/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Stochasticity Modeling in Memristors","sourcePdf":"tnano-naous-2493960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129943S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7373702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7373702","articleId":"7305797","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7305801,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuke Yan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiuke","lastName":"Yan","id":"37401814300"},{"name":"Xiangdong Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xiangdong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085699937"},{"name":"Min Shen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Shen","id":"37085701399"},{"name":"Dexin Xie","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Dexin","lastName":"Xie","id":"37287211200"},{"name":"Baodong Bai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Baodong","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085426243"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7305801","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":914},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transformers","Finite element analysis","Manganese","Eddy currents","Magnetic fields","Loss measurement","Steel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","eddy current losses","finite element analysis","Fourier series","least mean squares methods","magnetic flux","Maxwell equations","optimisation","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","power transformer tank walls","finite-element method","FEM","magnetic flux density","Fourier series","least mean error","curve fitting technique","electromagnetic theory","Maxwell equations","TEAM Problem 21"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double Fourier series","Eddy current losses","FEM","Power transformer"]},{"kwd":["Double Fourier series","eddy-current losses","finite-element method (FEM)","power transformer"]}],"abstract":"An improved analysis method to calculate the eddy-current losses in large power transformer tank walls is presented.

Many image enhancement algorithms for improving the visual quality of underwater images have been developed. Unfortunately, no well-accepted objective measure exists that can evaluate the quality of underwater images similar to human perception. Predominant underwater image processing algorithms use either a subjective evaluation, which is time consuming and biased, or a generic image quality measure, which fails to consider the properties of underwater images. To address this problem, a new nonreference underwater image quality measure (UIQM) is presented in this paper. The UIQM comprises three underwater image attribute measures: the underwater image colorfulness measure (UICM), the underwater image sharpness measure (UISM), and the underwater image contrast measure (UIConM). Each attribute is selected for evaluating one aspect of the underwater image degradation, and each presented attribute measure is inspired by the properties of human visual systems (HVSs). The experimental results demonstrate that the measures effectively evaluate the underwater image quality in accordance with the human perceptions. These measures are also used on the AirAsia 8501 wreckage images to show their importance in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2015.2469915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/7509707/07305804.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7509707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2015.2469915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-Visual-System-Inspired Underwater Image Quality Measures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Human-Visual-System-Inspired Underwater Image Quality Measures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305804/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16139114","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305804/","volume":"41","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-Visual-System-Inspired Underwater Image Quality Measures","sourcePdf":"joe-gao-2469915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116868S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7509707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"7509707","articleId":"7305804","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7305813,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Smistad","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology and SINTEF Medical Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Smistad","id":"37085622425"},{"name":"Frank Lindseth","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology and SINTEF Medical Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Lindseth","id":"38468134200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"7305813","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1992},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arteries","Ultrasonic imaging","Image edge detection","Real-time systems","Image segmentation","Probes","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","blood vessels","computerised tomography","image reconstruction","image registration","image segmentation","image sequences","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time automatic femoral artery segmentation","ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia","ultrasound-guided femoral nerve block","Kalman filter","CT dataset","ultrasound sequences","average Dice similarity coefficient","Hausdorff distance","distance 0.33 mm","distance 1.05 mm","time 38 ms","time 8 ms","time 46 ms","time 0.2 ms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artery segmentation","artery tracking","femoral nerve block","GPU","real-time","regional anaesthesia","ultrasound"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Female","Femoral Artery","Femoral Nerve","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Male","Nerve Block","Ultrasonography, Interventional"]}],"abstract":"The goal is to create an assistant for ultrasound- guided femoral nerve block. By segmenting and visualizing the important structures such as the femoral artery, we hope to improve the success of these procedures. This article is the first step towards this goal and presents novel real-time methods for identifying and reconstructing the femoral artery, and registering a model of the surrounding anatomy to the ultrasound images. The femoral artery is modelled as an ellipse. The artery is first detected by a novel algorithm which initializes the artery tracking. This algorithm is completely automatic and requires no user interaction. Artery tracking is achieved with a Kalman filter. The 3D artery is reconstructed in real-time with a novel algorithm and a tracked ultrasound probe. A mesh model of the surrounding anatomy was created from a CT dataset. Registration of this model is achieved by landmark registration using the centerpoints from the artery tracking and the femoral artery centerline of the model. The artery detection method was able to automatically detect the femoral artery and initialize the tracking in all 48 ultrasound sequences. The tracking algorithm achieved an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.91, absolute distance of 0.33 mm, and Hausdorff distance 1.05 mm. The mean registration error was 2.7 mm, while the average maximum error was 12.4 mm. The average runtime was measured to be 38, 8, 46 and 0.2 milliseconds for the artery detection, tracking, reconstruction and registration methods respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2494160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7422860/07305813.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2494160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Automatic Artery Segmentation, Reconstruction and Registration for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia of the Femoral Nerve","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305813/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Automatic Artery Segmentation, Reconstruction and Registration for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia of the Femoral Nerve","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823119","pubMedId":"26513782","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305813/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Unions Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"610425"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Real-Time Automatic Artery Segmentation, Reconstruction and Registration for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anaesthesia of the Femoral Nerve","sourcePdf":"tmi-smistad-2494160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157395S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7422860","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7422860","articleId":"7305813","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7305821,"authors":[{"name":"Azad Ghaffari","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7463574/7305821/ghaff-2494518-small.gif","p":["Azad Ghaffari (M'13) received the B.S. degree in electrical\n engineering and the M.S. degree in control engineering from the K.

The contour error estimate (CEE) significantly affects contouring precision. Conventional CEE methods rely on static single-point techniques to reconstruct contour error using current position error and an estimate of the reference map at the lead point. The performance of such static CEE methods deteriorates dramatically with increasing contour feedrate and at sharp corners. Hence, a dynamic CEE algorithm based on the Newton update algorithm is proposed to achieve high-precision CEE. Since the convergence rate of the Newton algorithm is user assignable and independent of the reference contour, the proposed CEE stays almost identical to the contour error for vastly different feedrates or sharp corners. Multiaxis cross-coupling adds more design steps for the position control loops. Therefore, in this paper, feedback signals are modified such that a separate cross-coupling controller is no longer needed. It has been shown, analytically and experimentally, that the modified feedback in combination with integral sliding mode control provides simpler design and fewer steps in comparison to conventional CCC designs. Moreover, the proposed CEE and the concept of modified feedback together result in reduced contour error. Various experiments are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm at high feedrates and for sharp corners.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7305821/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985672","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Contour Error Estimation and Feedback Modification for High-Precision Contouring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Contour Error Estimation and Feedback Modification for High-Precision Contouring","sourcePdf":"tmech-ghaffari-2494518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122306S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7463574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7463574","articleId":"7305821","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":7305822,"authors":[{"name":"Oluleye D.

Similarly, the access latency through the cache memory system significantly impacts the overall processor performance. Several techniques have been proposed to tackle the individual power or performance. However, almost all trade off performance for power or vice versa. We propose a novel scheme that improves performance while reducing both static and dynamic power with minimal area overhead. Our proposed scheme reduces dynamic power by using a hash-based mechanism to minimize the number of cache lines read during program execution. This is achieved by identifying and not reading those that are guaranteed non-matches (i.e., cache misses) to a new access. Performance improvement occurs when all cache lines of a referenced set are determined non-matches to the requested address, and therefore skip a few cache pipe stages as guaranteed misses. Static power savings is achieved by exploiting in-flight cache access information to deterministically lower the power state of cache lines that are guaranteed not to be accessed in the immediate future. These techniques easily integrate into existing cache architectures and were evaluated using widely known CAD tools and benchmarks. We have observed up to 92, 17, and 2 percent improvements in performance, static, and dynamic power, respectively, with less than 3 percent area overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2494043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2494043","startPage":"150","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7358202/07305822.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Cache Power and Performance Using Deterministic Naps and Early Miss Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving Cache Power and Performance Using Deterministic Naps and Early Miss Detection","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15663143","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7305822/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Cache Power and Performance Using Deterministic Naps and Early Miss Detection","sourcePdf":"tmscs-nourani-2494043-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122774S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7358202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","xplore-issue":"7358202","articleId":"7305822","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7305825,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Sarofeen","affiliation":["Computational Analysis and Design, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, West Bethesda, MD"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7511818/7305825/sarof-2494038-small.gif","p":["Christian Sarofeen received the MS degree in mechanical engineering\n from The Pennsylvania State University in 2011.

The algorithm exhibits well behaved weak scalability with 92.7 percent parallel efficiency at 50 nodes compared to maximum performance observed. It is also shown that the algorithm efficiently utilizes a large portion of the available hardware. During beamforming the GPU is utilized at 51.8 percent of its maximum double precision floating point throughput whereas a comparable Central Processing Unit (CPU) version utilizes 60.0 percent of its maximum expected floating point throughput.

However, standard versions of these algorithms cannot guarantee optimality or even high-quality for the produced paths. In recent years, variants of these methods, such as T-RRT, have been proposed to deal with cost spaces: by taking configuration-cost functions into account during the exploration process, they can produce high-quality (i.e., low-cost) paths. Other novel variants, such as RRT*, can deal with optimal path planning: they ensure convergence toward the optimal path, with respect to a given path-quality criterion. In this paper, we propose to solve a complex problem encompassing this two paradigms: optimal path planning in a cost space. For that, we develop two efficient sampling-based approaches that combine the underlying principles of RRT* and T-RRT. These algorithms, called T-RRT* and AT-RRT, offer the same asymptotic optimality guarantees as RRT*. Results presented on several classes of problems show that they converge faster than RRT* toward the optimal path, especially when the topology of the search space is complex and/or when its dimensionality is high.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Probabilistic logic","Robots","Space exploration","Cost function","Robustness","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal path planning","complex cost spaces","sampling based algorithms","rapidly exploring random tree","RRT","exploration process","robot path planning method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anytime path planning","cost space path planning","optimal path planning","sampling-based path planning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASE.2015.2487881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7447676/07305826.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7447676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2015.2487881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Path Planning in Complex Cost Spaces With Sampling-Based Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Path Planning in Complex Cost Spaces With Sampling-Based Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305826/","volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305826/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15918151","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Path Planning in Complex Cost Spaces With Sampling-Based Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tase-cortes-2487881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068488S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7447676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7447676","articleId":"7305826","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7305828,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Corradi","affiliation":["University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Institute of Neuroinformatics, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7337496/7305828/7305828-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Federico Corradi (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree in physics from Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Parma, Parma, Italy, the M.Sc. degree (cum laude) in physics from La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, and Ph.D. degrees in natural sciences from the University of Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, and in neuroscience from the Neuroscience Center Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.","Currently, he is a Research and Development Scientist at INILabs, a spin-off company of the Institute of Neuroinformatics that produces and sells neuromorphic technologies.

The fabricated system includes a low-noise amplifier, a delta-modulator analog-to-digital converter, and a low-power band-pass filter. The bio-amplifier has a programmable gain of 45-54 dB, with a Root Mean Squared (RMS) input-referred noise level of 2.1 \u03bcV, and consumes 90 \u03bcW . The band-pass filter and delta-modulator circuits include asynchronous handshaking interface logic compatible with event-based communication protocols. We describe the properties of the neural recording circuits, validating them with experimental measurements, and present system-level application examples, by interfacing these circuits to a reconfigurable neuromorphic processor comprising an array of spiking neurons with plastic and dynamic synapses. The pool of neurons within the neuromorphic processor was configured to implement a recurrent neural network, and to process the events generated by the neural recording system in order to carry out pattern recognition.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2479256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7337496/07305828.pdf","startPage":"699","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2479256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neuromorphic Event-Based Neural Recording System for Smart Brain-Machine-Interfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7305828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305828/","displayDocTitle":"A Neuromorphic Event-Based Neural Recording System for Smart Brain-Machine-Interfaces","volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618377","pubMedId":"26513801","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305828/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neuromorphic Event-Based Neural Recording System for Smart Brain-Machine-Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tbcas-corradi-2479256-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058053S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7337496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7337496","articleId":"7305828","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7305830,"authors":[{"name":"Yebin Lee","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7456352/7305830/lee-2488282-small.gif","p":["Yebin Lee received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Kyungil University, Gyeongsan, Korea, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computing.","He is interested in low-power embedded systems/software and computer architecture research mainly focused on design of energy-efficient and high-performance memory systems."]},"firstName":"Yebin","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-5047-3568","id":"37407192700"},{"name":"Soontae Kim","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7456352/7305830/kim-2488282-small.gif","p":["Soontae Kim (M\u201907) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, USA, in 2003.","He was an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA, from 2004 to 2007.

Thus, reducing the energy consumption of DRAM can prolong the lifetime of battery-operated embedded/mobile systems. To this end, we propose a DRAM energy-aware prefetching scheme to increase row buffer hits and idle periods of DRAM by clustering its accesses. Although prefetching schemes have traditionally been used to improve the system performance, utilizing them for the energy conservation of DRAM has yet to be investigated. For such energy conservation, our scheme accurately predicts and clusters potential future DRAM accesses. Clustered DRAM accesses exploit a popular first-ready first-come first-serve memory request scheduling and a power-down mode of DRAM more effectively; the probability of row buffer hits and idle periods is significantly increased by our clustering scheme. As a result, large amounts of row activation and idle energy consumption, which are major energy consumption factors in modern DRAM, can be saved. Our prefetching-based memory traffic-clustering scheme was shown to reduce the power and energy consumption of DRAM and improve its performance by an average of 0.2%, 28.9%, and 15.7%, respectively, for memory-intensive programs.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2488282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7456352/07305830.pdf","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2488282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CLAP: Clustered Look-Ahead Prefetching for Energy-Efficient DRAM System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"CLAP: Clustered Look-Ahead Prefetching for Energy-Efficient DRAM System","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7305830/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2016","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935065","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP [10041313, UX-oriented Mobile SW Platform] and the National Research Foundation (NRF) grant funded by Korean Government","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A2A01007051"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLAP: Clustered Look-Ahead Prefetching for Energy-Efficient DRAM System","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lee-2488282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141043S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7456352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7456352","articleId":"7305830","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7305839,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Saeed Sarafraz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7347494/7305839/7305839-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Saeed Sarafraz received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

The \u03bc-NET can be used to support molecular biology applications like DNA, RNA, and protein biosynthesis. The \u03bc-NET is the first realization of a microfluidic networking paradigm that controls movements of droplets in microfluidic chips by exploiting hydrodynamic phenomena only and builds on recent solutions to achieve communications in the microfluidic domain. The \u03bc-NET integrates techniques to represent addressing information, as well as switching and medium access control solutions. In fact, in \u03bc-NET, the address of the molecular processor where a droplet should be sent to is encoded into the distance between droplets; switching is executed to steer the droplets inside the microfluidic device; medium access control is applied to avoid collisions between droplets that may result in their fusion and, thus, loss of the biochemical information. In this paper, the design of \u03bc-NET is presented in detail, and simulation results validating \u03bc-NET operations are shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7305842/","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7305842/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16231767","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>-NET: A Network for Molecular Biology Applications in Microfluidic Chips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>-NET: A Network for Molecular Biology Applications in Microfluidic Chips","sourcePdf":"tnet-galluccio-2472564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08924S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7305842","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7305900,"authors":[{"name":"James Pond","affiliation":["Lumerical Solutions, Inc., Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Pond","id":"37085486664"},{"name":"Jackson Klein","affiliation":["Lumerical Solutions, Inc., Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Jackson","lastName":"Klein","id":"37085489250"},{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["Lumerical Solutions, Inc., Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085652417"},{"name":"Jonas Flueckiger","affiliation":["Lumerical Solutions, Inc., Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Flueckiger","id":"37572303200"},{"name":"Amy Liu","affiliation":["Lumerical Solutions, Inc., Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Amy","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085640141"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8255-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8254-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-2081"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-209X"}],"articleNumber":"7305900","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"We present a vision for photonic circuit simulation within sophisticated EDA-style design flows and the tool development roadmap to achieve it.

Active noise control solutions could improve environment sound quality significantly, especially at low frequencies where standard passive solutions would be much bulky and expensive. Narrow-band approaches have been widely discussed in the past because of their simplicity and effectiveness in the cancellation of tonal noises. In this paper the authors propose a novel adaptive algorithm based on narrow-band Filtered-x Least Mean Square algorithm which, instead of adapting two taps per tone simultaneously, updates only one tap at a time and derives the other one from the knowledge of the adapted tap and the a-priori known amplitude of the disturbing tone. Proposed solution implicitly prevents instability conditions of standard two-taps solutions, avoiding consequent high comfort deterioration and hardware breakups. Experimental simulations have been carried out to show proposed algorithm behaviors under stress conditions, proving that its performances are comparable with those of classic narrow-band algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Signal processing algorithms","Speech","Speech processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active noise control","adaptive control","least mean squares methods","production equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude constrained FxLMS algorithm","narrow-band active noise control applications","industrial equipment","environment sound quality","adaptive algorithm","narrow-band filtered-x least mean square algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2015.7306064","publicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7300342/7306014/07306064.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2015.7306064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An amplitude constrained FxLMS algorithm for narrow-band active noise control applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An amplitude constrained FxLMS algorithm for narrow-band active noise control applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306064/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306064/","accessionNumber":"15556854","conferenceDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An amplitude constrained FxLMS algorithm for narrow-band active noise control applications","confLoc":"Zagreb, Croatia","sourcePdf":"00510001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04082S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7300342","isNumber":"7306014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7300342","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306014","articleId":"7306064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306068,"authors":[{"name":"Seyyed Mahdi Najmabadi","affiliation":["Department of Parallel Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Seyyed Mahdi","lastName":"Najmabadi","id":"37085637131"},{"name":"Zhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Parallel Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Wang","id":"37857245700"},{"name":"Yousef Baroud","affiliation":["Department of Parallel Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Baroud","id":"37085642470"},{"name":"Sven Simon","affiliation":["Department of Parallel Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Simon","id":"37266660100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8032-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8031-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1845-5921"}],"articleNumber":"7306068","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel coding","Throughput","Hardware","Pipelines","Resource management","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic codes","encoding","entropy codes","field programmable gate arrays","Huffman codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-based entropy coding architectures","asymmetric numeral systems entropy encoding","compression algorithm","tabled asymmetric numeral systems","tANS","Huffman encoding","arithmetic encoding","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asymmetric numeral systems","entropy coding","Huffman coding","arithmetic coding","reconfigurable architecture design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper two new hardware-based entropy coding architectures for asymmetric numeral systems are introduced, as entropy encoding is one of the major phases in a compression algorithm.

Game development tools can be of great help, but require highly specialized professionals. Also, just as any software development effort, game development has some challenges. Model-Driven Game Development (MDGD) is suggested as a means to solve some of these challenges, but with a loss in flexibility. We propose a MDGD approach that combines multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs) with design patterns to provide flexibility and allow generated code to be integrated with manual code. After experimentation, we observed that, with the approach, less experienced developers can create games faster and more easily, and the product of code generation can be customized with manually written code, providing flexibility. However, with MDGD, developers become less familiar with the code, making manual codification more difficult.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCARS.2015.24","publicationTitle":"2015 IX Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures and Reuse Software","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IX Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures and Reuse Software","pdfPath":"/iel7/7305894/7306110/07306135.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"139","doi":"10.1109/SBCARS.2015.24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Model-Driven Game Development Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Model-Driven Game Development Approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306135/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557272","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306135/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Model-Driven Game Development Approach","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"9630a130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098629S","chronDate":"21-22 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7305894","isNumber":"7306110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7305894","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306110","articleId":"7306135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7306147,"authors":[{"name":"You Yanan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, BeiHang University (BUAA), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Yanan","id":"37888783600"},{"name":"Xu Huaping","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, BeiHang University (BUAA), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Huaping","id":"37586328900"},{"name":"Li Chunsheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, BeiHang University (BUAA), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chunsheng","id":"37408680200"},{"name":"Zhang Lvqian","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Lvqian","id":"37888076000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7297-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7296-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306147","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"abstract":"Interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique for obtaining high-quality digital elevation mode (DEM). Without temporal decorrelation, the efficiency and accuracy of bistatic and multistatic SAR are better than the single-pass interferometry. Multiple phase center (MPC) SAR increases the spatial sampling rate to overcome the contradiction of wide-swath observation and high azimuth resolution. In order to improve DEM coverage and accuracy, bistatic InSAR with MPC technique is proposed in our research, this interferometric data acquisition mode provides an effective approach for high-quality DEM generation. Phase-precision is well preserved, and simulation results verify the feasibility of bistatic MPC InSAR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Apertures","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","radar interferometry","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bistatic SAR interferometric processing","phase preservation","multiple phase center sampling","interferometry synthetic aperture radar","InSAR","remote sensing technique","digital elevation mode","DEM","spatial sampling rate","wide-swath observation","high azimuth resolution","interferometric data acquisition mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple phase center","SAR imaging","interferometrie processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306147","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293555/7306138/07306147.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of phase preservation for bistatic SAR interferometrie processing based on multiple phase center sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of phase preservation for bistatic SAR interferometrie processing based on multiple phase center sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306147/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306147/","accessionNumber":"15568804","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of phase preservation for bistatic SAR interferometrie processing based on multiple phase center sampling","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP008129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041416S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293555","isNumber":"7306138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293555","xplore-issue":"7306138","articleId":"7306147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7306154,"authors":[{"name":"Yaolong Qi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Goaf Disasters Prevention, State Administration of Work Safety, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yaolong","lastName":"Qi","id":"38542638800"},{"name":"Yanping Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Goaf Disasters Prevention, State Administration of Work Safety, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293647900"},{"name":"Weixian Tan","affiliation":["Radar Research Institute, Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China"],"firstName":"Weixian","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085707154"},{"name":"Xiaolin Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Goaf Disasters Prevention, State Administration of Work Safety, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085718030"},{"name":"Pingping Huang","affiliation":["Radar Research Institute, Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China"],"firstName":"Pingping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37965466000"},{"name":"Husheng Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Goaf Disasters Prevention, State Administration of Work Safety, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Husheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085711002"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7297-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7296-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306154","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"The Snapshot imaging radar based on antenna array can achieve high-resolution imaging both in spatial domain and time domain.

First, the maximum likelihood estimator is used to obtain the frequency range of the noisy interferogram. Then, the wavelet transform is employed to obtain the wavelet coefficients of the real and imaginary parts of the complex interferogram. For the wavelet coefficients within the estimated frequency range and that out of the range, the NeighShrink and VisuShrink methods are employed respectively to shrink them. As a result, the noise can be effectively filtered without the loss of detailed information of the interferogram based on the advantages of the two shrinkage methods. The performance of noise reduction and fringe preservation is verified by the experiments with real interferogram.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293555/7306138/07306193.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","doi":"10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR interferometrie phase filtering based on wavelet transform and local frequency estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences","Apertures","Hafnium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","phase noise","radar interferometry","synthetic aperture radar","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR interferometric phase filtering","wavelet transform","local frequency estimation","interferometric phase noise","maximum likelihood estimator","noisy interferogram","wavelet coefficients","complex interferogram","NeighShrink methods","VisuShrink methods","shrinkage methods","noise reduction","fringe preservation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interferometrie SAR","phase filtering","threshold shrink","local frequency estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"SAR interferometrie phase filtering based on wavelet transform and local frequency estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568795","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR interferometrie phase filtering based on wavelet transform and local frequency estimation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP054053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075126S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293555","isNumber":"7306138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293555","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7306138","articleId":"7306193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306194,"authors":[{"name":"Shunichiro Fujinami","affiliation":["Dept.

In this system, three spastically distributed radars are employed. Each is a Ku-band MIMO-SAR, transmitting mutually orthogonal waveforms and sensing the slope movement from different view angles. The three radars can then achieve the deform measurements in the three line of sight (LOS) directions. After an effective fusion of these measurements, the deform vector, with direction and amount, can be resolved. This vector is particularly important for risk warning as well as for understanding the motion mechanism of landslide. Moreover, the data acquisition period can be largely reduced, since the use of MIMO radar allows a simultaneous sampling of the scene echo. The time decorrelation is therefore very small, and hence high measurement accuracy can be expected. It can be proved that, using this system, the three-dimensional accuracy can reach 0.1 ~ 1 mm. Simulations and experimental datasets are used to validate this proposal.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar

The conventional compressive imaging methods usually assume that the target to be recovered is sparse on some prior known grids by discretizing a continuous imaging scope. However, this condition cannot be satisfied in real applications such as radar imaging and the mismatch between the actual sparse representation and the assumed one will degrade the performance of conventional methods considerably. To deal with this problem, this paper adopts a continuous compressed sensing (CCS) method based on atomic norm minimization which works directly in the continuous parameter space thus no modeling error exists. An efficient algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is presented to solve the equivalent semidefinite programming problem. Experimental results based on both synthetic and measured data demonstrate that the proposed approach obtains improved sparse recovery accuracy compared with conventional grid-based CS method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional radar imaging based on continuous compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","doi":"10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306304","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293555/7306138/07306304.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional radar imaging based on continuous compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306304/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568793","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional radar imaging based on continuous compressed sensing","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP165182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053192S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293555","isNumber":"7306138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293555","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306138","articleId":"7306304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306308,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Navigation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085671273"},{"name":"Yijun Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Navigation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085669057"},{"name":"Yongan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Navigation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Yongan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085461252"},{"name":"Long Chi","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Navigation, Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Chi","id":"37603845800"},{"name":"Yong Wu","affiliation":["Shaanxi Institute of Metrology Science, Xi'an, People's Republic of China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085469798"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7297-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7296-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306308","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":576},"abstract":"Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has been widely used in radar signal processing field, and the reconstruction algorithm is the key to whether the original signal can be reconstructed from limited observations. However, the existing reconstruction algorithms either don't consider and remove the noise in signal reconstruction, or need the iterative estimation of noise variance during the signal reconstruction processing, which will lead the poor anti-noise performance or large computation load. In this paper, a cognitive signals reconstruction algorithm based on compressed sensing is proposed. In the method, the noise variance can be estimated by subspace decomposition method, and then the estimated noise variance is used as priori information in reconstruction algorithms to improve the reconstruction accuracy or reduce the computation load. As a result, the reconstruction algorithm performance can be improved effectively.

In this paper, a novel technique is proposed via the combination of amplitude reversal and total variation (TV). Instead of SAR image processing, it uses SAR raw echo signal for sparse reconstruction. The technique mainly considers two scattering properties of building shadow: the zero scattering intensity and the extended block sparsity. Amplitude reversal is proposed to restrain the former, while TV is exploited to restrain the latter. Then the problem becomes a combined cost function minimization, and the gradient projection method is used for solution.

The simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of RPCA based method for GMTI in MIMO SAR system.","doi":"10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306331","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7293555/7306138/07306331.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSAR.2015.7306331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO SAR GMTI with RPCA based method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306331/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO SAR GMTI with RPCA based method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568768","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306331/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO SAR GMTI with RPCA based method","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP192083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056108S","chronDate":"1-4 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7293555","isNumber":"7306138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7293555","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306138","articleId":"7306331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306369,"authors":[{"name":"Jiann-Ching Guey","affiliation":["MEDIATEK INC"],"firstName":"Jiann-Ching","lastName":"Guey","id":"37354594700"},{"name":"Pei-Kai Liao","affiliation":["MEDIATEK INC"],"firstName":"Pei-Kai","lastName":"Liao","id":"37085620273"},{"name":"Yih-Shen Chen","affiliation":["MEDIATEK INC"],"firstName":"Yih-Shen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085629055"},{"name":"Alex Hsu","affiliation":["MEDIATEK INC"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37689266200"},{"name":"Chien-Hwa Hwang","affiliation":["MEDIATEK INC"],"firstName":"Chien-Hwa","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37085630297"},{"name":"Gabriel Lin","affiliation":["MEDIATEK INC"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085631022"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1284"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0687"}],"articleNumber":"7306369","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3145},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In early 2012, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under the United Nations initiated a program to develop an International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT) system for 2020 and beyond (IMT-2020), thereby officially kicking off the global race toward a yet to be defined fifth generation (5G) mobile network. Fast forward three years, the vision of this next-generation system is beginning to take shape. A recent ITU-Radiocommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-R) Draft Recommendation [1] on IMT-2020 identifies three key usage scenarios in 5G as enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable and low-latency communications. The same report also issues guidance on the requirements for these scenarios in terms of performance index such as spectrum efficiency, latency, connection density, and area traffic capacity, as shown in Fig. 1. In order to meet these requirements and bring this visionary system to reality, we believe that the future 5G network will be one that is built on a small cell backbone. As spectrum suitable for mobile communication becomes more and more scarce, densification is the only way to meet the area traffic capacity demand. Even for millimeter-wave band, where spectrum is abundant, the channel's propagation characteristics will likely limit its range for mobile access to that of a small cell, at least in the early phase of 5G before device technology matures. The small cell also brings the radio access point closer to the end device, thereby shortening the last and most challenging segment of an end-to-end communication link, consequently reducing latency and increasing reliability. Many of the massive number of machine-type communications can also benefit from the extended battery life resulting from shorter uplink distance. To facilitate the deployment of a future mobile network that has the small cell as its primary traffic bearing workhorse,the current radio access architecture needs to undergo some major revamping, and new technologies need to be introduced.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","5G mobile communication","Microprocessors","Interference","Uplink","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["International Telecommunication Union","International Mobile Telecommunication system","IMT system","IMT-2020","fifth generation mobile network","5G mobile network","ITU-Radiocommunication Standardization Sector Draft Recommendation","ITU-R Draft Recommendation","enhanced mobile broadband","massive machine-type communications","spectrum efficiency","latency","connection density","future 5G network","small cell backbone","densification","area traffic capacity demand","mobile access","radio access point","end-to-end communication link"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7306369","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7306366/07306369.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7306369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On 5G radio access architecture and technology [Industry Perspectives]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On 5G radio access architecture and technology [Industry Perspectives]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306369/","volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306369/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15558018","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On 5G radio access architecture and technology [Industry Perspectives]","sourcePdf":"003WCM_INDUSTRY_PERSPECTIVES-October.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038924S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306369","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7306533,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"bio":{"p":["Zhen Gao (gao-z11@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) is currently working toward his Ph.

To realize UDN, a reliable, gigahertz bandwidth, and cost-effective backhaul connecting ultradense small-cell BSs and macrocell BS are prerequisite. Millimeter-wave can provide the potential gigabit-per-second traffic for wireless backhaul. Moreover, mmWave can easily be integrated with massive MIMO for improved link reliability. In this article, we discuss the feasibility of mmWave massive-MIMO-based wireless backhaul for 5G UDN, and the benefits and challenges are also addressed. In particular, we propose a digitally controlled phase shifter network (DPSN)-based hybrid precoding/combining scheme for mmWave massive MIMO, whereby the low-rank property of the mmWave massive MIMO channel matrix is leveraged to reduce the required cost and complexity of a transceiver with a negligible performance loss. One key feature of the proposed scheme is that the macrocell BS can simultaneously support multiple small-cell BSs with multiple streams for each small-cell BS, which is essentially different from conventional hybrid precoding/combining schemes, typically limited to single-user MIMO with multiple streams or multi-user MIMO with single stream for each user. Based on the proposed scheme, we further explore the fundamental issues of developing mmWave massive MIMO for wireless backhaul, and the associated challenges, insight, and prospects to enable mmWave massive-MIMO-based wireless backhaul for 5G UDN are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","volume":"22","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568118","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306533/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MmWave massive-MIMO-based wireless backhaul for the 5G ultra-dense network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MmWave massive-MIMO-based wireless backhaul for the 5G ultra-dense network","sourcePdf":"007DAI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065203S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306533","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7306534,"authors":[{"name":"Uzma Siddique","affiliation":["University of Manitoba"],"bio":{"p":["Uzma Siddique (Uzma.siddique@umanitoba.ca) received her B.

In this context, this article provides an overview of the different backhaul solutions and highlights the perceived challenges in backhauling small cells. A qualitative overview of the existing research studies and their critical assumptions are then discussed. Next, for backhauling downlink traffic of a small cell user, we characterize the cellular region in which the downlink transmission capacity for a user served by a given half-duplex small cell becomes limited by the backhaul link capacity. We then illustrate solution techniques such as full-duplex backhauling to improve the performance of wireless backhauling for small cells.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7306534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7306366/07306534.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7306534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless backhauling of 5G small cells: challenges and solution approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","displayDocTitle":"Wireless backhauling of 5G small cells: challenges and solution approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306534/","publicationDate":"October 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15558021","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306534/","volume":"22","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless backhauling of 5G small cells: challenges and solution approaches","sourcePdf":"008HOSSAIN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115545S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306534","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7306535,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De La Oliva","affiliation":["University Carlos III of Madrid"],"bio":{"p":["Antonio De La Oliva (aoliva@it.uc3m.es) received his telecommunications engineering degree in 2004 and his Ph.D. in 2008 from UC3M, where he has been working as an associate professor since then.

This transport network shall flexibly interconnect distributed 5G radio access and core network functions, hosted on network centralized nodes, through the implementation of a control infrastructure using a unified, abstract network model for control plane integration (Xhaul Control Infrastructure, XCI); and a unified data plane encompassing innovative high-capacity transmission technologies and novel deterministic-latency switch architectures (Xhaul packet Forwarding Element, XFE).

In this article, we first review small cell evolutions and the consequent radio access network architecture evolution toward heterogeneity and centralized baseband processing. The backhaul solution, which is mainly determined by the availability of existing backhaul infrastructures and service demand, will lead to a heterogeneous backhaul network architecture. Radio resource management issues including cell association, and interference management and scheduling with inter-node coordination, as well as how they are related to backhaul solutions are discussed. Based on the existing RRM solutions and their limitations in multi-tier 5G systems with heterogeneous backhaul network architecture, backhaul- aware RRM strategies are envisioned. Results from a simple case study of joint cell association and bandwidth allocation with a massive MIMO-based in-band wireless backhauling framework are presented to demonstrate the performance gain with backhaul-aware RRM in a multi-tier cellular RAN. Several related open research issues are highlighted, and possible solution approaches are briefly discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","volume":"22","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568117","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306536/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Backhauling 5G small cells: A radio resource management perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backhauling 5G small cells: A radio resource management perspective","sourcePdf":"010WANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067175S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306536","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7306538,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology Beijing(USTB)"],"bio":{"p":["Zhongshan Zhang received B.E. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and received his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2004 from BUPT.

LS-MIMO technology as a \u201ccleanslate\u201d approach is shown to be capable of dramatically increasing the area spectral efficiency (SE, as measured in bits per second per Hertz per square kilometer) while simultaneously improving the energy efficiency as measured in bits per Joule. Furthermore, the concept of LS-MIMO has established itself as a beneficial transmission/detection paradigm, thus substantially reducing the impact of interference relying on some advanced transmit precoding/ beamforming/detection techniques. This article is intended to offer a state-of-the-art survey on LS-MIMO research, to promote the discussion of its beneficial application areas and the research challenges associated with BF aided wireless backhaul, LS-MIMO channel modeling, signal detection, and so on. Additionally, a joint group power allocation and pre-beamforming scheme called JGPAPBF is proposed to substantially improve the performance of LS-MIMO-based wireless backhaul in heterogeneous networks.

However, achieving connectivity by using wired-wireless media converters significantly increases system complexity, power consumption, and latency. A seamless combination of fiber and radio links in which photonics-based technologies are used to generate and transmit radiowave signals is more suitable. In this article, we present an overview of fiber-radio link combination for mobile signal transmission. We propose an efficient solution for future mobile fronthauling based on the analog transmission of mobile signals over a bidirectional seamless system. We discuss the potential as well as the challenges and perspectives of the systems applied for mobile fronthauling in small-cell- and moving-cell- based networks. We also present a proof-of-concept demonstration of the transmission of mobile signals over the system. Satisfactory performance is obtained for different high-speed advanced signals. The transmission range over fiber links and the estimated range of the radio links are sufficiently long to facilitate the practical implementation of the system. The system is scalable to include new deployments of small cells and wireless services using wavelength-division and subcarrier multiplexing techniques. It can provide a high-speed, low-latency, and flexible solution for fronthauling in new emerging wireless systems such as 5G networks.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7306539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7306366/07306539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7306539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306366","startPage":"67","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio-on-radio-over-fiber: efficient fronthauling for small cells and moving cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radio-on-radio-over-fiber: efficient fronthauling for small cells and moving cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2015","accessionNumber":"15568116","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306539/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio-on-radio-over-fiber: efficient fronthauling for small cells and moving cells","sourcePdf":"013DAT_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095723S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306539","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306541,"authors":[{"name":"Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval","affiliation":["Aalto University"],"bio":{"p":["Renaud-alexandre Pitaval (renaud.a lexand reopltaval@ alumni.aalto.fi) received an M.Sc. in 2008 from the Grenoble Institute of Technology, France, and an M.Sc. and a D.Sc. in 2009 and 2014 from Aalto University, Finland, all in electrical engineering.

Self-backhauling is particularly efficient when coupled with FD relaying.

The use of radio resources in the self-backhauling and access hops can be coordinated to maximize end-to-end performance.

However, the classical fronthauling method demands large bandwidth, low latency, and tight synchronization from the transport network, and only allows for point-to-point logical topology. This greatly limits the usage of fronthaul in many 5G scenarios. In this article, we introduce a new perspective to understand and design fronthaul for next-generation wireless access. We allow the renovated fronthaul to transport information other than time-domain I/Q samples and to support logical topologies beyond point-to-point links. In this way, different function splitting schemes can be incorporated into the radio access network to satisfy the bandwidth and latency requirements of ultradense networks, control/data decoupling architectures, and delay-sensitive communications. At the same time, massive cooperation and devicecentric networking could be effectively enabled with point-to-multipoint fronthaul transportation. We analyze three unique design requirements for the renovated fronthaul, including the ability to handle various payload traffic, support different logical topology, and provide differentiated latency guarantee. Following this analysis, we propose a reference architecture for designing the renovated fronthaul. The required functionalities are categorized into four logical layers and realized using novel technologies such as decoupled synchronization layer, packet switching, and session-based control. We also discuss some important future research issues.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7306542","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7306366/07306542.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7306542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","startPage":"90","endPage":"97","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redesigning fronthaul for next-generation networks: beyond baseband samples and point-to-point links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Redesigning fronthaul for next-generation networks: beyond baseband samples and point-to-point links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306542/","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7306542/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2015","accessionNumber":"15558023","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redesigning fronthaul for next-generation networks: beyond baseband samples and point-to-point links","sourcePdf":"016LIU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053844S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306542","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7306543,"authors":[{"name":"Hayssam Dahrouj","affiliation":["Effat University"],"bio":{"p":["Hayssam Dahrouj [5'02, M'11, Sm (hayssam.dahrouj@gmail.com) received his B.E. degree (with high distinction) in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, in 2005, and his Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto (UofT), Canada, in 2010.

This densification, made possible by small-cell deployment, also brings a novel set of challenges, specifically related to the cost of ownership, in which backhaul is of primary concern. This article proposes a cost-effective hybrid RF/free-space optical (FSO) solution to combine the advantages of RF backhauls (low cost, NLOS applications) and FSO backhauls (high-rate, low latency). To first illustrate the cost advantages of the RF backhaul solution, the first part of this article presents a business case of NLOS wireless RF backhaul, which has a low cost of ownership as compared to other backhaul candidates. RF backhaul, however, is limited by latency problems. On the other side, an FSO solution, which offers better latency and higher data rate than RF backhauls, remains sensitive to weather and nature conditions (e.g., rain, fog). To combine RF and FSO advantages, the second part of this article proposes a lowcost hybrid RF/FSO solution, wherein base stations are connected to each other using either optical fiber or hybrid RF/FSO links. This part addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of backhaul planning under reliability, connectivity, and data rate constraints, and proposes choosing the appropriate cost-effective backhaul connection between BSs (i.e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO) using graph theory techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","volume":"22","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568115","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306543/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cost-effective hybrid RF/FSO backhaul solution for next generation wireless systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-effective hybrid RF/FSO backhaul solution for next generation wireless systems","sourcePdf":"017DAHROUJ_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049012S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306543","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7306544,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Bartelt","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen, DE"],"bio":{"p":["Jens Bartelt (jens.bartelt@tu-dresden.de) received his Dipling.

While the frequency-division duplexing (FDD) and timedivision duplexing (TDD) are widely used in 4G mobile wireless networks, they have their inherent deficiencies of low spectrum efficiency because FDD and TDD are both based on the half-duplex transmission mode. To overcome these problems existing in 4G systems, in this article we propose novel wireless full-duplex transmission schemes in both the PHY and MAC layers for 5G mobile wireless networks to significantly increase the spectrum efficiency. In particular, we first develop the wireless fullduplex model for both bidirectional transmission and unidirectional transmission, respectively, taking into account self-interference mitigation. Then we analyze the traditional half-duplex FDD and TDD modes and show the superiority of the wireless full-duplex mode over the halfduplex FDD and TDD modes, respectively. Using our developed wireless full-duplex model, we develop and evaluate the efficient full-duplex power allocation scheme at the PHY layer. Corresponding to full-duplex transmission at the PHY layer, we also develop and analyze the fullduplex MAC protocol at the MAC layer to implement full-duplex transmission over the entire 5G mobile wireless network architecture. Through simulation experiments we show that our proposed schemes can significantly enhance spectrum efficiency for 5G mobile wireless networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","volume":"22","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"15558020","publicationDate":"October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306545/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Full-duplex transmission in phy and mac layers for 5G mobile wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-duplex transmission in phy and mac layers for 5G mobile wireless networks","sourcePdf":"019ZHANG2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061133S","chronDate":"October  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7306366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7306366","articleId":"7306545","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7306574,"authors":[{"name":"Pratik Satam","affiliation":["NSF Center for cloud and Autonomic Computing, The University of Arizona"],"firstName":"Pratik","lastName":"Satam","id":"37085449954"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8439-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306574","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Intrusion detection","Cross layer design","Conferences","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Databases","Open systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","protocols","security of data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system","computer networks","network capacity","mobile devices","tablet computers","smart phones","smart devices","wearable computing","communications protocols","OSI model","IDS","data mining","statistical techniques","partial attack model","anomaly behavior analysis modules","Wi-Fi protocols","DNS protocols","IP protocols","UDP protocols","TCP protocols","false alarms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system","machine learning","data mining","DNS","Wi-Fi"]}],"abstract":"Since the start of the 21st century, computer networks have been through an exponential growth in terms of the network capacity, the number of the users and the type of tasks that are performed over the network. With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms.","doi":"10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/7305895/7306518/07306574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306518","startPage":"157","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross Layer Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross Layer Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection System","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306574/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570866","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross Layer Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection System","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"8439a157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025348S","chronDate":"21-25 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7305895","isNumber":"7306518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7305895","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7306518","articleId":"7306574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306659,"authors":[{"name":"Libin K.

Among all the available spectrum sensing techniques, energy detection is simple, because of its incoherent nature. However, performance of conventional energy detection deteriorates in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regions. Performance of the detector also declines because of the inappropriate decision threshold. In this paper, an adaptive threshold based energy detection scheme is proposed in order to make the best trade off between probability of miss detection and false alarm. Numerical results shows that proposed scheme gives better performance than the conventional one.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCE.2015.47","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303283/7306547/07306659.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCE.2015.47","publicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","startPage":"104","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Algorithm for Energy Detection in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Algorithm for Energy Detection in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306659/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306659/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15557185","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Algorithm for Energy Detection in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Dehradun, India","sourcePdf":"1734a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050497S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303283","isNumber":"7306547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303283","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306547","articleId":"7306659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306662,"authors":[{"name":"Sahil Abrol","affiliation":["Department of ECE PEC, University of Technology, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Sahil","lastName":"Abrol","id":"37085614130"},{"name":"Rita Mahajan","affiliation":["PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, Punjab, IN"],"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Mahajan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1734-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1733-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306662","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"abstract":"In this paper, a hardware implementation of an artificial neural network on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) is done step by step. First single neurons are implemented using different activation function and then a XOR Gate is implemented. The concurrent structure of a neural network makes it very fast for the computation of certain tasks. This makes ANN well suited for implementation in VLSI technology. Hardware realization of a Neural Network depends on the efficient implementation of Artificial single neuron. FPGA-based reconfigurable computing architectures are suitable for hardware implementation of neural networks. FPGA realization of ANNs with a large number of neurons is still a challenging task. Here design and implementation of a Single neuron with various activation functions is done and then an XOR Gate is implemented using one of these designs. The design of XOR Gate is done by using gradient descent algorithm and taking 3-layers 5-neurons model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303283/7306547/07306662.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICACCE.2015.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCE.2015.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Single Artificial Neuron Using Various Activation Functions and XOR Gate on FPGA Chip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Hardware","Logic gates","Field programmable gate arrays","Artificial neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","gradient methods","logic gates","neural chips","reconfigurable architectures","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single artificial neuron","activation function","XOR gate","FPGA chip","artificial neural network","field programmable gate array","concurrent structure","ANN","VLSI technology","hardware realization","artificial single neuron","FPGA-based reconfigurable computing architecture","gradient descent algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","VHDL","Back propagation Algorithm","Xilinx FPGA","Sigmoid Activation Function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Single Artificial Neuron Using Various Activation Functions and XOR Gate on FPGA Chip","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306662/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15557125","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Single Artificial Neuron Using Various Activation Functions and XOR Gate on FPGA Chip","confLoc":"Dehradun, India","sourcePdf":"1734a118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03704S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303283","isNumber":"7306547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303283","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306547","articleId":"7306662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306670,"authors":[{"name":"Lokesh Nitin Patil","affiliation":["Dept.

There are various spectrum sensing techniques like matched filter detection, energy detection, cyclostationary detection, covariance detection and wavelet detection. Out of these techniques energy detection has got the most attention by the researchers due to its simplicity and low computational requirements. However, the performance of energy detection scheme degrades at low signal to noise ratio (SNR) region. To improve the performance of the energy detection scheme at low SNR conditions, we have proposed an adaptive threshold which is a function of the detection threshold (calculated under the fixed probability of false alarm) and SNR of the primary user (SNRp) received at the sensing node. The proposed adaptive threshold based energy detection scheme provides better performance at low SNR region than the fixed threshold based energy detection scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15557114","htmlLink":"/document/7306689/","conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Based on Adaptive Threshold","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Based on Adaptive Threshold","confLoc":"Dehradun, India","sourcePdf":"1734a253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069983S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303283","isNumber":"7306547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303283","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7306547","articleId":"7306689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7306693,"authors":[{"name":"Himani","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Global Institute of management & emerging Technologies, Amritsar, India"],"lastName":"Himani","id":"37085667066"},{"name":"Harmanbir Singh Sidhu","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Chandigarh Group of colleges, India"],"firstName":"Harmanbir Singh","lastName":"Sidhu","id":"37085668928"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1734-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1733-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306693","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nascent technology","Internet","cost-deadline-based task scheduling","CDB task scheduling algorithm","cost-deadline-based task scheduling algorithm","space-shared scheduling policy","virtual machine","cloud computing environment","resource utilization","response time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","task scheduling","scheduling algorithms","Virtual Machines","Space-shared policy","CDB task scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is a nascent technology which widely spreads among researchers.

Due to these dissimilar objectives, we need to design, develop a noble scheduling strategy to outperform proper division of tasks on virtual machines. Recently existing scheduling algorithm may work proficiently in some perspective. But they are unable to achieve deadline of task and attain maximum profit. In this paper, new mechanism is proposed which take care of deadline and cost, then scheduled the task according to need.

A standard IEEE 13 bus distribution network has been modified by adding wind and diesel generators for the case studies. The proposed test system is simulated in MATLAB/simulink environment. Voltage signals captured at nodes of the test system are used for power quality analysis. The harmonic detection has been carried out using Fast Fourier Transform and voltage sag, swell have been detected by voltage index calculated based on wavelet analysis. The unbalance in the system has been detected by the sequence components of voltage. The power quality disturbances associated with the events such as islanding, grid synchronization and outage of wind generators have been investigated. The detection of islanding, grid synchronization and outage has been proposed using sequence components of voltages measured.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCE.2015.52","publicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303283/7306547/07306703.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCE.2015.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Quality Detection in Distribution System with Wind Energy Penetration Using Discrete Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306703/","displayDocTitle":"Power Quality Detection in Distribution System with Wind Energy Penetration Using Discrete Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15557161","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306703/","conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Quality Detection in Distribution System with Wind Energy Penetration Using Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Dehradun, India","sourcePdf":"1734a328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082351S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303283","isNumber":"7306547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303283","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7306547","articleId":"7306703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306718,"authors":[{"name":"Sakshi Arya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Tula's Institute, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Sakshi","lastName":"Arya","id":"37085754969"},{"name":"Akansha Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Tula's Institute, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Akansha","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085764665"},{"name":"Nandani Ghildiyal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Tula's Institute, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Nandani","lastName":"Ghildiyal","id":"37085756410"},{"name":"Deepak Punetha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Tula's Institute, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Punetha","id":"37085534248"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1734-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1733-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306718","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306718","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Tuning","Bandwidth","RLC circuits","Couplings","Impedance","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","optimisation","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi stage tuned amplifier","resonant frequency","tuning circuits","cascade amplifier","Q factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["tuned amplifier","resonance","bandwidth","cascading","transformer coupling","selectivity"]}],"abstract":"This paper report describes the performance of a multi stage tuned amplifier. Tuning can be done to select only desired frequency and to get the required output. Single tuned amplifier selects the frequency equal to the resonant frequency. At resonant frequency it can provide higher impedance but it has few disadvantages like poor selectivity, poor bandwidth, and greater power loss in order to overcome these problems double tuned amplifier has been used. Double tuned amplifier has two tuning circuits and thus larger gain can be achieved by cascading double tuned amplifier. This cascade amplifier arrangement is beneficiary to improve the Q factor, selectivity, sensitivity, improved frequency response and less power loss.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCE.2015.97","publicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303283/7306547/07306718.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"403","doi":"10.1109/ICACCE.2015.97","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing and Optimization to the Performance of Multi Stage Tuned Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Designing and Optimization to the Performance of Multi Stage Tuned Amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15557089","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306718/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing and Optimization to the Performance of Multi Stage Tuned Amplifier","confLoc":"Dehradun, India","sourcePdf":"1734a400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046485S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303283","isNumber":"7306547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303283","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7306547","articleId":"7306718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7306721,"authors":[{"name":"Rojal Tusacno","affiliation":["Electron. & Tele Commun.

In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach towards credit card fraud detection in which the fraud detection is done in three phases. The first phase does the initial user authentication and verification of card details. If the check is successfully cleared, then the transaction is passed to the next phase where fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is applied to find out the normal usage patterns of credit card users based on their past activity. A suspicion score is calculated according to the extent of deviation from the normal patterns and thereby the transaction is classified as legitimate or suspicious or fraudulent. Once a transaction is found to be suspicious, neural network based learning mechanism is applied to determine whether it was actually a fraudulent activity or an occasional deviation by a genuine user. Extensive experimentation with stochastic models shows that the combined use of clustering technique along with learning helps in detecting fraudulent activities effectively while minimizing the generation of false alarms.","doi":"10.1109/ICACCE.2015.33","startPage":"494","endPage":"499","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7303283/7306547/07306735.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 Second International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communication Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACCE.2015.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Hybrid Approach Using Fuzzy Clustering & Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Credit cards","Neural networks","Authentication","Hidden Markov models","Clustering algorithms","Data mining","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","banking","electronic commerce","formal verification","fraud","fuzzy set theory","neural nets","pattern clustering","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["credit card fraud detection","fuzzy clustering","e-commerce","online banking","user authentication","verification","fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm","neural network based learning mechanism","stochastic models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fraud","credit card","suspicion score","fuzzy clustering","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Hybrid Approach Using Fuzzy Clustering & Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306735/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15557076","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Hybrid Approach Using Fuzzy Clustering & Neural Network","confLoc":"Dehradun, India","sourcePdf":"1734a494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086451S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7303283","isNumber":"7306547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7303283","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7306547","articleId":"7306735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7306766,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Kumar Jain","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Jaypee University of Engineering & Technology, Guna, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Vinay Kumar","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085649409"},{"name":"Shishir Kumar","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Jaypee University of Engineering & Technology, Guna, M.P, India"],"firstName":"Shishir","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37290706100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1734-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1733-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306766","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":834},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Cloud computing","Companies","Data analysis","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","data analysis","data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data analytic","cloud computing","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big data","cloud computing","data mining","distributed computing","cluster computing","trust"]}],"abstract":"Innovations in technology and greater affordability of digital devices with internet made a new global world of data called big data.

It is a fact that data that is too big to process is also too big to transfer anywhere, so it's just the analytical program which needs to be moved -- not the data. This is possible with cloud computing, as most of the public data sets such as Facebook, Twitter, financial markets data, weather data, genome datasets and aggregated industry-specific data live in the cloud and it becomes more cost-effective for the enterprise to analysis this data in the cloud itself.

Muclouds improves the simulation performance for these large systems, such that the simulation time can be minimized. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose a novel technique named stage and partition (SAP). SAP is based on the following observation: in an event-based simulation framework for cloud computing, the existence of the interaction and/or correlation of the events, which imposes simulation synchronization, is the major factor that prevents efficient parallelization. To achieve improved parallelization performance, SAP divides events into two main categories: non-interacting events and interacting events. Non-interacting events can be simulated simultaneously to achieve high simulation speed, whereas interacting events must be simulated sequentially to preserve accuracy. Using Muclouds, we constructed several scenarios to evaluate parallelization effectiveness and efficiency. We also conduct several experiments for performance comparisons with state-of-the-art schemes. Evaluation results show that Muclouds facilitates considerable performance improvements when compared with existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.104","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/7306109/7306779/07306937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306779","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Muclouds: Parallel Simulator for Large-Scale Cloud Computing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Muclouds: Parallel Simulator for Large-Scale Cloud Computing Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306937/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15557374","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7306937/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Muclouds: Parallel Simulator for Large-Scale Cloud Computing Systems","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"7646a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069964S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7306109","isNumber":"7306779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7306109","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7306779","articleId":"7306937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306943,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Min Chao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Min","lastName":"Chao","id":"37085622589"},{"name":"Hsiang-Yuan Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Yuan","lastName":"Fu","id":"37071710300"},{"name":"Li-Ren Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Ren","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085632354"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7646-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7645-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7306943","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Delays","Routing protocols","Ad hoc networks","Conferences","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","routing protocols","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic forwarder selection","PU occupancy problem","any path routing protocol","multichannel rendezvous protocol","CRAHN","network performance improvement","packet delivery transmission minimisation","multihop cognitive radio ad hoc network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","Dynamic Spectrum Access","Anypath Routing","Channel Hopping","Wireless Multi-hop Networks"]}],"abstract":"Compared with traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), designing a routing protocol in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRAHNs) is more difficult since issues such as the primary user (PU) occupancy problem and the multichannel rendezvous problem must be solved. Any path Routing, a kind of schemes that enables dynamic forwarder selection, seems to be a possible solution to the PU occupancy problem. An any path routing protocol must combine with a multi-channel rendezvous protocol to become a total solution. To the best of our knowledge, there is no any path routing protocol designed for CRAHNs. In this paper, we propose an any path routing scheme in CRAHNs that can be built on top of existing multichannel rendezvous solutions. The objective of the proposed routing solution is to minimize the number of transmissions to deliver a packet. Simulation results verify that the proposed protocol improves network performance when compared with existing CRAHN routing protocols.","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.109","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/7306109/7306779/07306943.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.109","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops","startPage":"127","endPage":"133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anypath Routing Protocol for Multi-hop Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7306943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Anypath Routing Protocol for Multi-hop Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306943/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7306943/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15557411","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anypath Routing Protocol for Multi-hop Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"7646a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083571S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7306109","isNumber":"7306779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7306109","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7306779","articleId":"7306943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7306950,"authors":[{"name":"Wenqian Nan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, P.R.

To encourage user participation in mobile crowd sensing, we propose a novel incentive mechanism called CSII -- a Cross-Space, multi-Interaction-based Incentive mechanism. CSII can estimate the value of a task based on the sensing context and historical data. It then has multiple interactions with both the task requester and the candidate contributors to provide a suggestion on budget and select suitable people to form the worker group. Finally, the requester pays the workers' reward that they deserved by reverse auction based on their reputation and bids. Both online and offline data are leveraged to estimate task value and user quality for a particular task. Experiments show that the incentive mechanism can achieve good performance in terms of acceptance ratio, overpayment ratio, user utility, and so on.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7306950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15557395","htmlLink":"/document/7306950/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Space, Multi-interaction-Based Dynamic Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Space, Multi-interaction-Based Dynamic Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"7646a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075526S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7306109","isNumber":"7306779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7306109","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7306779","articleId":"7306950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7307005,"authors":[{"name":"Mohssen M.Z.E.

In spite of the enthusiasm and great interest, Cloud computing has not yet earned full trust of the individual customers, banks, armed forces, governments, and companies who do sensitive computing tasks. While it is not the goal to persuade everyone to use the technology and some types of tasks are to be done with secrecy, for the general works done by the companies and customers, Cloud could be heavily used. However, it is very difficult to convince people that the Cloud Providers (CPs) would keep their data protected. To address this issue, what required is to employ some mechanism that can establish the trust of the users. With this motivation, in this paper, we present a novel concept for trust assurance in Cloud services with the proposal of implementing a Global Central Bank-like regulatory authority. Our initiative is termed International Center for Monitoring Cloud Computing Providers (ICMCCP). Various facets of ICMCCP model have been described alongside the policy making issues. Necessary backgrounds of Cloud are also presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"International Center for Monitoring Cloud Computing Providers (ICMCCP) for Ensuring Trusted Clouds","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops","doi":"10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.25","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing and 2014 IEEE 11th Intl Conf on Autonomic and Trusted Computing and 2014 IEEE 14th Intl Conf on Scalable Computing and Communications and Its Associated Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/7306109/7306779/07307005.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom.2014.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7306779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"International Center for Monitoring Cloud Computing Providers (ICMCCP) for Ensuring Trusted Clouds","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307005/","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15557332","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"International Center for Monitoring Cloud Computing Providers (ICMCCP) for Ensuring Trusted Clouds","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"7646a571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056264S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7306109","isNumber":"7306779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7306109","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7306779","articleId":"7307005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307048,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Canhao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Thomas Canhao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37546829800"},{"name":"Jussi Toivonen","affiliation":["Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Toivonen","id":"37085654212"},{"name":"Tapio Pahikkala","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Tapio","lastName":"Pahikkala","id":"37856613500"},{"name":"Ville Lepp\u00e4nen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Lepp\u00e4nen","id":"37345469800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7646-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7645-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307048","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Instruction sets","Algorithm design and analysis","Multicore processing","System-on-chip","Measurement","Yttrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BDMap","heuristic application mapping algorithm","Big Data era","multicore processors","inter-process communication","adjacent-contiguous-nearest expanding strategy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we explore and analyse a heuristic mapping algorithm optimized for big data applications.

It is expected that tens of even hundreds of cores will be integrated on a single processor. However, traditional mapping algorithm has not been well designed for big data applications. We investigate the behaviour of these applications. The on-chip traffic of an application is analysed in terms of cache and memory latencies. We propose a mapping algorithm for big data applications. The algorithm is optimized to reduce latencies to shared cache and memory controller, while inter-process communication is considered as well. To reduce search space, we propose calculating the mapping region with the congregate degree of nodes, together with an adjacent-contiguous-nearest expanding strategy. The mapping algorithm is compared with two other algorithms with several big data workloads.

Current neural computers are primarily developed to mimic biology. They use neural networks, which can be trained to perform specific tasks to mainly solve pattern recognition problems. These machines can do more than simulate biology; they allow us to rethink our current paradigm of computation. The ultimate goal is to develop brain-inspired general purpose computation architectures that can breach the current bottleneck introduced by the von Neumann architecture. This work proposes a new framework for such a machine. We show that the use of neuron-like units with precise timing representation, synaptic diversity, and temporal delays allows us to set a complete, scalable compact computation framework.

We focus on higher order modulation of each of the three degrees of freedom allowed in Stokes-vector detection. 2 bits are encoded on each intensity of the two orthogonal polarizations, and 2 bits are encoded in the phase difference between the two polarizations, giving a 6 bits per symbol format. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage DSP algorithm and we compare this new algorithm with our earlier two-stage algorithm using the following metrics: the computational complexity and the bit error rate (BER) performance. Using the three stage approach, waveform filtering and derotation are applied in series rather than in parallel as was done in the two stage algorithm. We show that the three-stage approach exhibits equal BER performance, while significantly reducing the total required number of real additions and real multiplications. Moreover, tracking the state of polarization using the proposed method is m -times more efficient, where m is the number of taps in the first filtering stage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Signal Processing for Dual-Polarization Intensity and Interpolarization Phase Modulation Formats Using Stokes Detection","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2494078","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7404304/07307086.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2494078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404304","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Digital Signal Processing for Dual-Polarization Intensity and Interpolarization Phase Modulation Formats Using Stokes Detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7307086/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15786184","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Signal Processing for Dual-Polarization Intensity and Interpolarization Phase Modulation Formats Using Stokes Detection","sourcePdf":"jlt-chagnon-2494078-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072757S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7404304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7404304","articleId":"7307086","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307090,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Taha Hussein","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Ahmed Taha Hussein received the B.Sc. degree (First Class Hons.) in\n electronic and electrical engineering and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communication systems both from the\n University of Mosul, Mosul, Iraq, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

However, higher data rates, beyond 10 Gb/s, are challenging due to the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and inter symbol interference (ISI). In this paper, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we propose, design, and evaluate a VLC system that employs beam steering (of part of the VLC beam) using adaptive finite vocabulary of holograms in conjunction with an imaging receiver and a DAT to enhance SNR and to mitigate the impact of ISI at high data rates (20 Gb/s). An algorithm was used to estimate the receiver location, so that part of the white light can be directed towards a desired target (receiver) using beam steering to improve SNR. Simulation results of our location estimation algorithm (LEA) indicated that the required time to estimate the position of the VLC receiver is typically within 224 ms in our system and environment. A finite vocabulary of stored holograms is introduced to reduce the computation time required by LEA to identify the best location to steer the beam to the receiver location. The beam steering approach improved the SNR of the fully adaptive VLC system by 15 dB at high data rates (20 Gb/s) over the DAT imaging LDs-VLC system in the worst-case scenario. In addition, we examined our new proposed system in a very harsh environment with mobility. The results showed that our proposed VLC system has strong robustness against shadowing, signal blockage, and mobility.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2495165","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7332227/07307090.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7332227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2495165","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"5242","endPage":"5260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"20 Gb/s Mobile Indoor Visible Light Communication System Employing Beam Steering and Computer Generated Holograms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"20 Gb/s Mobile Indoor Visible Light Communication System Employing Beam Steering and Computer Generated Holograms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307090/","volume":"33","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/7307090/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Dec.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15645973","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"20 Gb/s Mobile Indoor Visible Light Communication System Employing Beam Steering and Computer Generated Holograms","sourcePdf":"jlt-hussein-2495165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132601S","chronDate":"Dec.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7332227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"7332227","articleId":"7307090","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7307097,"authors":[{"name":"Masayuki Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Opto-Mechatronics, Faculty of Systems Engineering, Wakayama University, Wakayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37074044800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7307097","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Experimental setup of opto-electronic DQPSK signal regenerator.","type":"graphic","fileSize":"56KB","file":"/ielx7/4563994/7305892/7307097/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2495117.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/7305892/7307097/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-2495117.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Repeaters","Optical noise","Optical fiber amplifiers","Signal to noise ratio","Optical amplifiers","Limiting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical modulation","integrated optics","integrated optoelectronics","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","optical fibre communication","optical limiters","optical noise","optical receivers","optical repeaters","quadrature phase shift keying","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DQPSK signal regenerator","differential quadrature phase-shift keying","electrical limiting amplifiers","optoelectronic regenerator","parallel delay interferometers","balanced detectors","driving amplifiers","dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator","noise-suppressed optical QPSK signals","receiver sensitivity","optical signal-to-noise ratio","OSNR","electrical circuits","electrical power consumption","semiconductor optical amplifiers","nonlinear element"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical communications","Coherent communication","Electro-optical systems","Fiber optics systems"]},{"kwd":["Optical communications","coherent communication","electrooptical systems","fiber optics systems"]}],"abstract":"A simple optoelectronic regenerator for differential quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) signals is demonstrated.

We experimentally show that the regenerator improves the receiver sensitivity by about 8 dB at an input optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) of 19 dB at a signal speed of 10 Gbaud. Numerical simulation is conducted for higher speed operation at 56 Gbaud to study the impact of the bandwidth of electrical circuits inside the regenerator on the regenerator performance.

A feasible solution for the problem is incorporating various priors into restoration procedure as constrained conditions. Recently, the patch-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) priors became popular. However, the learning of patch-based GMM priors usually assumes the components of the GMM are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The assumption means that two components could model the same training samples, and thus a possible decrease in model's description ability. This work presents a new learning method to diversify the patch-based GMM priors through modeling the GMM's parameters as a determinantal point process (DPP). The introduction of DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in patch-based GMM using a positive definite kernel function and thus to increase the model's description ability for a given model complexity. Furthermore, under the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL) restoration framework, we further introduce the diversified patch-based GMM priors into remote sensing literature and develop new remote sensing image restoration algorithms. The extensive experiments for denoising and deblurring of remote sensing images demonstrated that the proposed algorithms produced better restoration results than other methods that already proven to perform well in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2488583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2488583","startPage":"5225","endPage":"5245","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7384408/07307106.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Diversify Patch-Based Priors for Remote Sensing Image Restoration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Diversify Patch-Based Priors for Remote Sensing Image Restoration","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"8","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307106/","accessionNumber":"15704945","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307106/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271439"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003181","fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China (FANEDD)","grantNumber":"201243"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NECT-13-0164"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Diversify Patch-Based Priors for Remote Sensing Image Restoration","sourcePdf":"jstars-zhong-2488583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138004S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7384408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7384408","articleId":"7307106","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7307108,"authors":[{"name":"He Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085478774"},{"name":"Wen Yueh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yueh","id":"38232101200"},{"name":"Saibal Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Saibal","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37278557500"},{"name":"Sudhakar Yalamanchili","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Sudhakar","lastName":"Yalamanchili","id":"37265490400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6056"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6064"},{"format":"CD","value":"2473-2575"}],"articleNumber":"7307108","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Cache memory","Random access memory","Adaptation models","Computer architecture","Microarchitecture","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","integrated circuit design","memory architecture","multiprocessing systems","performance evaluation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermally adaptive cache access mechanisms","3D many-core architectures","microarchitectures","thermal coupling challenging current thermal solutions","system level performance","microarchitecture adaptation","device-level temperature-dependent delay variations","last level cache","processor DVFS state","LLC temperature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D IC, SRAM cache, adaptive architecture, performance gain, energy efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307108","abstract":"A compelling confluence of technology and application trends in which the cost, execution time, and energy of applications are being dominated by the memory system is driving the industry to 3D packages for future microarchitectures. However, these packages result in high heat fluxes and increased thermal coupling challenging current thermal solutions. Conventional design approaches utilize design margins that correspond to worst case temperatures and process corners leading to a significant impact on system level performance. This paper advocates a design approach based on microarchitecture adaptation to device-level temperature-dependent delay variations to realize average case performance that is superior to which can be achieved by using worst case design margins. We demonstrate this approach with adaptation principles for the last level cache (LLC) in a 3D many-core architecture. We propose and evaluate two adaptation mechanisms. In the first case, the access time to the LLC from the L1 tracks the LLC's temperature-delay variations. In the second case, the processor DVFS state tracks the LLC temperature as a negative feedback. Compared to a worst case design baseline, the full system simulation results show that both approaches increase the IPC by over 20 percent, and improve the energy efficiency by up to 3 percent.","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2015.2495125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/7797573/07307108.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7797573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2015.2495125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermally Adaptive Cache Access Mechanisms for 3D Many-Core Architectures","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10208/7797573/7307108-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Thermally Adaptive Cache Access Mechanisms for 3D Many-Core Architectures","htmlLink":"/document/7307108/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16560859","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"SRC","grantNumber":"2318.001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0855110"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Thermally Adaptive Cache Access Mechanisms for 3D Many-Core Architectures","sourcePdf":"lca-xiao-2495125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055068S","chronDate":"July-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"7797573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7797573","articleId":"7307108","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307109,"authors":[{"name":"Shancheng Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shancheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38241136100"},{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7307109","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":662},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307109","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Cascading style sheets","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory","Decoding","Silicon","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","parity check codes","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance array-based nonbinary LDPC codes","low-density parity-check codes","nonbinary LDPC codes","NBLDPC codes","masking matrix M","asymptotic thresholds","error-prone substructures","column selection sets","Golomb rulers","parity-check matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array-based non-binary LDPC codes","inevitable cycles","masking","moderate rates","short-to-moderate lengths"]},{"kwd":["Array-based non-binary LDPC codes","inevitable cycles","masking","moderate rates","short-to-moderate lengths"]}],"abstract":"Based on arrays, excellent low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with high rates have been constructed.

Conventional data security techniques, such as access control and encryption, must be augmented with techniques to detect anomalies in data access that may indicate exfiltration attempts. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of DBSAFE, a system to detect, alert on, and respond to anomalies in database access designed specifically for relational database management systems (DBMS). The system automatically builds and maintains profiles of normal user and application behavior, based on their interaction with the monitored database during a training phase. The system then uses these profiles to detect anomalous behavior that deviates from normality. Once an anomaly is detected, the system uses predetermined policies guiding automated and/or human response to the anomaly. The DBSAFE architecture does not impose any restrictions on the type of the monitored DBMS. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed techniques are indeed effective in detecting anomalies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DBSAFE\u2014An Anomaly Detection System to Protect Databases From Exfiltration Attempts","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2487221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7959216/07307113.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2487221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7959216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"DBSAFE\u2014An Anomaly Detection System to Protect Databases From Exfiltration Attempts","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7307113/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16992975","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000180","fundingName":"Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate"},{"fundingName":"Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency"},{"fundingName":"Cyber Security Division"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DBSAFE\u2014An Anomaly Detection System to Protect Databases From Exfiltration Attempts","sourcePdf":"jsyst-bertino-2487221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071202S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7959216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7959216","articleId":"7307113","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307119,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Jae Lee","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Myung-Jae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37598674000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7307119","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1143},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS technology","Frequency measurement","Silicon","Photodetectors","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","CMOS integrated circuits","photodetectors","p-n junctions","silicon","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["responsivities","photodetection frequency responses","photodetection bandwidth","current-voltage characteristics","bandwidth limiting factor","CMOS silicon avalanche photodetectors","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Avalanche photodetector (APD),","avalanche photodiode","bandwidth","optical interconnect","photodetection bandwidth","photodiode","silicon photodiode","silicon photonics","spatially-modulated avalanche photodetector","standard CMOS"]},{"kwd":["Avalanche photodetector (APD)","avalanche photodiode","bandwidth","optical interconnect","photodetection bandwidth","photodiode","silicon photodiode","silicon photonics","spatially-modulated avalanche photodetector","standard CMOS"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First CMOS Silicon Avalanche Photodetectors With Over 10-GHz Bandwidth","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2015.2494847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360965","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/7360965/07307119.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2015.2494847","startPage":"276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307119","abstract":"This letter reports on the first silicon avalanche photodetectors (APDs) with over 10-GHz bandwidth.

The hypothesis that simultaneous multiscale views can improve composition-based inference of classes containing size-varying objects compared to single-scale multiview is investigated. The end-to-end learning system learns a hierarchical feature representation with the aid of convolutional layers to shift the burden of feature determination from hand-engineering to a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). This allows the classifier to obtain problem-specific features that are optimal for minimizing the multinomial logistic regression objective, as opposed to user-defined features which trade optimality for generality. A heuristic approach to the optimization of the DCNN hyperparameters is used, based on empirical performance evidence. It is shown that a single DCNN can be trained simultaneously with multiscale views to improve prediction accuracy over multiple single-scale views. Competitive performance is achieved for the UC Merced data set, where the 93.48% accuracy of multiview deep learning outperforms the 85.37% accuracy of SIFT-based methods and the 90.26% accuracy of unsupervised feature learning.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2015.2483680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2015.2483680","startPage":"2448","endPage":"2452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7327291/07307121.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiview Deep Learning for Land-Use Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multiview Deep Learning for Land-Use Classification","volume":"12","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15587724","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307121/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of South Africa"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiview Deep Learning for Land-Use Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-luus-2483680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076362S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7327291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"7327291","articleId":"7307121","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307123,"authors":[{"name":"Parnia Naghavi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Parnia","lastName":"Naghavi","id":"37085717789"},{"name":"Seyed Hamed Rastegar","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed","lastName":"Hamed Rastegar","id":"38521911000"},{"name":"Vahid Shah-Mansouri","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Shah-Mansouri","id":"38275680000"},{"name":"Hamed Kebriaei","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Kebriaei","id":"38275854600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7307123","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1390},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Nash equilibrium","Throughput","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Convergence","Rats","Heterogeneous networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","game theory","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAT selection game","5G heterogeneous networks","heterogeneous cellular network","multiple access technologies","RAT selection strategy","Q-learning-based algorithm","Nash equilibrium"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307123","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2495123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","abstract":"In this letter, we consider the problem of RAT selection in a heterogeneous cellular network where each user chooses among multiple access technologies.

For this case, we propose a Q-learning-based algorithm, which converges to the Nash equilibrium of the first problem.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2495123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412801","startPage":"52","endPage":"55","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7412801/07307123.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning RAT Selection Game in 5G Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307123/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning RAT Selection Game in 5G Heterogeneous Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15802496","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006115","fundingName":"Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences","grantNumber":"CS1393-4-41"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning RAT Selection Game in 5G Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"lwc-kebriaei-2495123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066111S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7412801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7412801","articleId":"7307123","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7307133,"authors":[{"name":"Munawar M.

Mining sequential generators as well as mining closed sequential patterns can contribute to a more concise result set than mining all sequential patterns, especially in the analysis of big data in bioinformatics. Previous studies have also presented convincing arguments that the generator is preferable to the closed pattern in inductive inference and classification. However, classic sequential generator mining algorithms, due to the lack of consideration on the contiguous constraint along with the lower-closed one, still pose a great challenge at spawning a large number of inefficient and redundant patterns, which is too huge for effective usage. Driven by some extensive applications of patterns with contiguous feature, we propose ConSgen, an efficient algorithm for discovering contiguous sequential generators. It adopts the n-gram model, called shingles, to generate potential frequent subsequences and leverages several pruning techniques to prune the unpromising parts of search space. And then, the contiguous sequential generators are identified by using the equivalence class-based lower-closure checking scheme. Our experiments on both DNA and protein data sets demonstrate the compactness, efficiency, and scalability of ConSgen.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/7585042/07307151.pdf","startPage":"855","endPage":"867","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2015.2495132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2015.2495132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7585042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining Contiguous Sequential Generators in Biological Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Databases","Data mining","Bioinformatics","Biology","Computational biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","biological techniques","data mining","DNA","molecular biophysics","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological sequence","big data analysis","bioinformatics","sequential generator mining algorithm","contiguous sequential generator mining","DNA dataset","protein dataset","ConSgen efficiency","ConSgen scalability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequential pattern mining","closed sequential pattern","sequential generator","contiguous sequential generator","DNA sequence","protein sequence","motif finding"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Conserved Sequence","Data Mining","Databases, Genetic","Machine Learning","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Sequence Alignment","Sequence Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mining Contiguous Sequential Generators in Biological Sequences","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7307151/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.-Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16356653","pubMedId":"26529774","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61375053"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2009AA04Z106"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining Contiguous Sequential Generators in Biological Sequences","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zhang-2495132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122704S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"7585042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7585042","articleId":"7307151","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307153,"authors":[{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7406788/7307153/zhao-2488680-small.gif","p":["Dongbin Zhao (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201910) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in materials processing engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1994, 1996, and 2000, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow of Humanoid Robot with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, from 2000 to 2002.

First, a model identifier based on a three-layer neural network (NN) is established to reconstruct the unknown NZS games systems. Moreover, the identifier weight vector is updated based on experience replay technique which can relax the traditional persistence of excitation condition to a simplified condition on recorded data. Then, the single-network adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with experience replay algorithm is proposed for each player to solve the coupled nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations, where only the critic NN weight vectors are required to tune for each player. The feedback Nash equilibrium is provided by the solution of the coupled HJ equations. Based on the experience replay technique, a novel critic NN weights tuning law is proposed to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and the convergence of the value functions. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is achieved. Finally, two simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2488680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7406788/07307153.pdf","startPage":"854","endPage":"865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2488680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7406788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experience Replay for Optimal Control of Nonzero-Sum Game Systems With Unknown Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307153/","displayDocTitle":"Experience Replay for Optimal Control of Nonzero-Sum Game Systems With Unknown Dynamics","volume":"46","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786258","pubMedId":"26529794","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307153/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273136, 61573353, 61533017 and 61304086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experience Replay for Optimal Control of Nonzero-Sum Game Systems With Unknown Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhao-2488680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092978S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7406788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"7406788","articleId":"7307153","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307154,"authors":[{"name":"Georg B\u00f6cherer","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM), M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7307154/boche-2494016-small.gif","p":["Georg B\u00f6cherer (S\u201905\u2013M\u201913) was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.

As the volume of sensor data and complexity of algorithms keep increasing, the bottleneck of FDP is mainly the limited computational resources, which is particularly true for distributed applications where FDP functions are deployed on microcontrollers and embedded systems with limited computation resources. This paper introduces the concept of Lebesgue sampling (LS) in FDP and proposes a LS-based FDP (LS-FDP) framework. In the proposed LS-FDP, a novel diagnostic philosophy of \u201cexecution only when necessary\u201d is developed in computation cost reduction. For prognosis, different from traditional approaches in which the prognostic horizon is on the time axis, the proposed approach defines the prognostic horizon on the fault state axis. With a reduced prognostic horizon, the LS-FDP naturally benefits the uncertainty management. The goal of this paper is to create the fundamental knowledge for LS-FDP solutions that are cost efficient, capable for the deployment on systems with limited computation sources, and supportive to the trend of distributed FDP schemes in complex systems. The design and implementation of particle-filter-based LS-FDP are presented with experimental results on lithium-ion batteries to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307155/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15775318","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lebesgue-Sampling-Based Diagnosis and Prognosis for Lithium-Ion Batteries","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ASPIRE Grant program at the University of South Carolina"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1329870"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61533013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National 973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB035406"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lebesgue-Sampling-Based Diagnosis and Prognosis for Lithium-Ion Batteries","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2494529-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09083S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7307155","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7307162,"authors":[{"name":"Jiwhan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7331739/7307162/kim-2495122-small.gif","p":["Jiwhan Kim (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Our approach consists of global and local features, which complement each other to compute a saliency map. The first key idea of our work is to create a saliency map of an image by using a linear combination of colors in a high-dimensional color space. This is based on an observation that salient regions often have distinctive colors compared with backgrounds in human perception, however, human perception is complicated and highly nonlinear. By mapping the low-dimensional red, green, and blue color to a feature vector in a high-dimensional color space, we show that we can composite an accurate saliency map by finding the optimal linear combination of color coefficients in the high-dimensional color space. To further improve the performance of our saliency estimation, our second key idea is to utilize relative location and color contrast between superpixels as features and to resolve the saliency estimation from a trimap via a learning-based algorithm. The additional local features and learning-based algorithm complement the global estimation from the high-dimensional color transform-based algorithm.

For the uplink, by assuming that the base station (BS) deploys maximum ratio combining (MRC) or zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, we present tight closed-form lower bounds on the achievable sum-rate for both receivers with aged channel state information (CSI). In addition, the benefit of implementing channel prediction methods on the sum-rate is examined, and closed-form sum-rate lower bounds are derived. Moreover, the impact of channel aging and channel prediction on the power scaling law is characterized. Extension to the downlink scenario and multicell scenario is also considered. It is found that, for a system with/without channel prediction, the transmit power of each user can be scaled down at most by 1/\u221aM (where M is the number of BS antennas), which indicates that aged CSI does not degrade the power scaling law, and channel prediction does not enhance the power scaling law; instead, these phenomena affect the achievable sum-rate by degrading or enhancing the effective signal to interference and noise ratio, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2493998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2493998","startPage":"4879","endPage":"4893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7358193/07307172.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate and Power Scaling of Massive MIMO Systems With Channel Aging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate and Power Scaling of Massive MIMO Systems With Channel Aging","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677212","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307172/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316104"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech.

The process starts at retrieving current signals at the relaying point and preprocessing through wavelet transform to derive effective features such as change in energy, entropy, and standard deviation using wavelet coefficients. Once the features are extracted against faulted and unfaulted situations for each-phase, the data set is built to train the decision tree (DT), which is validated on the unseen data set for fault detection in the microgrid. Further, the fault classification task is carried out by including the wavelet based features derived from sequence components along with the features derived from the current signals. The new data set is used to build the DT for fault detection and classification. Both the DTs are extensively tested on a large data set of 3860 samples and the test results indicate that the proposed relaying scheme can effectively protect the microgrid against faulty situations, including wide variations in operating conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Combined Wavelet and Data-Mining Based Intelligent Protection Scheme for Microgrid","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2487501","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7548088/07307183.pdf","startPage":"2295","endPage":"2304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2487501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7548088","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Combined Wavelet and Data-Mining Based Intelligent Protection Scheme for Microgrid","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7307183/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16249134","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Combined Wavelet and Data-Mining Based Intelligent Protection Scheme for Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tsg-mishra-2487501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075126S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7548088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"7548088","articleId":"7307183","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307186,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Nelson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/7352396/7307186/nelso-2495100-small.gif","p":["Alexander Nelson (S'13) received the BS degree in 2012 and the\n MS degree in 2013 in computer engineering from the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (U of A), AR.

Existing assistive technology solutions that provide access as user input devices are intrusive and expensive, and require physical contact that can have deleterious effects such as skin friction injury for paralyzed users who have reduced skin sensitivity. To address this problem, in this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a non-contact proximity gesture recognition system using fabric capacitive sensor arrays. The fabric sensors are lightweight, flexible, and can be easily integrated into items of quotidian use such as clothing, bed sheets, and pillow covers. Our gesture recognition algorithm builds on two known classification techniques, Hidden Markov Model and Dynamic Time Warping to convert raw capacitance values to alphanumeric gestures. Our system is personalized to the user, allowing personalized selection of gesture sets and definition of gesture patterns in accordance with their capabilities. Our system adapts to changes in sensor configuration and orientation with minimal user training and intervention. We have evaluated our system in the context of a gesture-driven home automation system on six subjects that includes an individual who has a C6 Spinal Cord injury. We show that our system can recognize gestures of varying complexity with an average accuracy of 99 percent with minimal training.","doi":"10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2495100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMSCS.2015.2495100","startPage":"62","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multi-Scale Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687315/7352396/07307186.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive and Personalized Gesture Recognition Using Textile Capacitive Sensor Arrays","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6687315/7352396/7307186-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive and Personalized Gesture Recognition Using Textile Capacitive Sensor Arrays","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15869809","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307186/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1406626"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Adaptive and Personalized Gesture Recognition Using Textile Capacitive Sensor Arrays","sourcePdf":"tmscs-banerjee-2495100-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088988S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687315","isNumber":"7352396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687315","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7352396","articleId":"7307186","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307188,"authors":[{"name":"Ren Zheng","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7384789/7307188/zheng-2488903-small.gif","p":["Ren Zheng received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2012.

These event-trigger rules can efficiently reduces loads of computation and information transmission at synapses of the neurons. The synaptic feedback of each neuron keeps a constant value based on the outputs of the other neurons at its latest triggering time but changes at its next triggering time, which is determined by a certain criterion. It is proved that every trajectory of the analytic neural network converges to certain equilibrium under this event-triggered rule for all the initial values except a set of zero measure. The main technique of the proof is the \u0141ojasiewicz inequality to prove the finiteness of trajectory length. The realization of this event-triggered rule is verified by the exclusion of Zeno behaviors.

Suitably located transmitters are designed to release a continuous flow of drug molecules in the surrounding environment, where they diffuse and reach the target. These molecules are received when they chemically react with compliant receptors deployed on the receiver surface. In these conditions, if the release rate is relatively high and the drug absorption time is significant, congestion may happen, essentially at the receiver site. This phenomenon limits the drug absorption rate and makes the signal transmission ineffective, with an undesired diffusion of drug molecules elsewhere in the body. The original contribution of this paper consists of a theoretical analysis of the causes of congestion in diffusion-based molecular communications. For this purpose, it is proposed a reception model consisting of a set of pure loss queuing systems. The proposed model exhibits an excellent agreement with the results of a simulation campaign made by using the Biological and Nano-Scale communication simulator version 2 (BiNS2), a well-known simulator for molecular communications, whose reliability has been assessed through in vitro experiments. The obtained results can be used in rate control algorithms to optimally determine the optimal release rate of molecules in drug delivery applications.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2015.2489565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7374759/07307189.pdf","startPage":"935","endPage":"945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2015.2489565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Molecular Communications Model for Drug Delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Molecular Communications Model for Drug Delivery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307189/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697464","pubMedId":"26529770","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307189/","volume":"14","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Molecular Communications Model for Drug Delivery","sourcePdf":"tnb-vasilakos-2489565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121584S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7374759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7374759","articleId":"7307189","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307193,"authors":[{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, and National Supercomputing Center in Changsha, Hunan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7511818/7307193/li-2495120-small.gif","p":["Kenli Li received the PhD degree in computer science from the\n Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2003.

We consider the problem from a game theoretic perspective and formulate it into a non-cooperative game among the multiple cloud users, in which each cloud user is informed with incomplete information of other users. For each user, we design a utility function which combines the net profit with time efficiency and try to maximize its value. We design a mechanism for the multiple users to evaluate their utilities and decide whether to use the cloud service. Furthermore, we propose a framework for each cloud user to compute an appropriate bidding price. At the beginning, by relaxing the condition that the allocated number of servers can be fractional, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium solution set for the formulated game. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm (\n<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {IA}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n), which is designed to compute a Nash equilibrium solution. The convergency of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed and we find that it converges to a Nash equilibrium if several conditions are satisfied. Finally, we revise the obtained solution and propose a near-equilibrium price bidding algorithm ( \n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {NPBA}$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n) to characterize the whole process of our proposed framework. The experimental results show that the obtained near-equilibrium solution is close to the equilibrium one.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2495120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7511818/07307193.pdf","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2495120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7511818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework of Price Bidding Configurations for Resource Usage in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307193/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework of Price Bidding Configurations for Resource Usage in Cloud Computing","volume":"27","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307193/","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61133005 and 61432005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370095, 61472124 and 61402400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001744","fundingName":"International Science & Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2015DFA11240"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework of Price Bidding Configurations for Resource Usage in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tpds-liu-2495120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133952S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7511818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7511818","articleId":"7307193","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307195,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Li","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7511818/7307195/dan-2489646-small.gif","p":["Dan Li received the PhD degree in computer science from Tsinghua\n University in 2007.

Though many recent proposals focus on guaranteeing job performance (with a particular note on network bandwidth) in the cloud, they usually lack efficient utilization of cloud resource, or vice versa. In this paper we present DCloud, which leverages the (soft) deadlines of cloud computing jobs to enable flexible and efficient resource utilization in data centers. With the deadline requirement of a job guaranteed, DCloud employs both time sliding (postponing the launching time of a job) and bandwidth scaling (adjusting the bandwidth associated with VMs) in resource allocation, so as to better match the resource allocated to the job with the cloud's residual resource. Extensive simulations and testbed experiments show that DCloud can accept much more jobs than existing solutions, and significantly increase the cloud provider's revenue with less cost for individual tenants.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2489646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2489646","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7511818/07307195.pdf","startPage":"2248","endPage":"2260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7511818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307195/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"DCloud: Deadline-Aware Resource Allocation for Cloud Computing Jobs","volume":"27","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16139255","htmlLink":"/document/7307195/","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2016","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB347800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61522205, 61170291 and 61432002"},{"fundingName":"National High-tech R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2013AA013303"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCloud: Deadline-Aware Resource Allocation for Cloud Computing Jobs","sourcePdf":"tpds-li-2489646-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148133S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7511818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7511818","articleId":"7307195","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7307197,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Ali Khan","affiliation":["School of Energy Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7307197/khan-small.gif","p":["Ashraf Ali Khan (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree in electronics\n engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2012.

More precisely, we predict both image-level labels (category labels) and object-level labels (locations) for objects within a target image in a unified framework. Traditional learning-based image annotation approaches are cumbersome, because they need to establish complex mathematical models and be frequently updated as the scale of training data varies considerably. Thus, we advocate the nonparametric method, which has shown potential in numerous applications and turned out to be attractive thanks to its advantages, i.e., lightweight training load and scalability. In particular, we exploit the salient object windows to describe images, which is beneficial to image retrieval and, thus, the subsequent image-level annotation and localization tasks. Our method, namely, saliency-aware nonparametric foreground annotation, is practical to alleviate the full label requirement of training data, and effectively addresses the problem of foreground annotation. The proposed method only relies on retrieval results from the image database, while pretrained object detectors are no longer necessary. Experimental results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2008 demonstrate the advance of our method.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2488637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7470313/07307208.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2488637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7470313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency-Aware Nonparametric Foreground Annotation Based on Weakly Labeled Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307208/","displayDocTitle":"Saliency-Aware Nonparametric Foreground Annotation Based on Weakly Labeled Data","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16002815","pubMedId":"26529788","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307208/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program, China","grantNumber":"2014BAK11B03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422213 and 61332012"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329305"},{"fundingName":"100 Talents Programme through the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program through the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDA06010701"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency-Aware Nonparametric Foreground Annotation Based on Weakly Labeled Data","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhang-2488637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148719S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7470313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7470313","articleId":"7307208","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307210,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Demirkan","affiliation":["\u0130stanbul \u015eehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Demirkan","orcid":"0000-0002-9140-0012","id":"37283196200"},{"name":"Gregory Silvus","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Longmont, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Silvus","id":"37355916700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7307210","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Encoding","Reliability","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Magnetic recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","interleaved codes","perpendicular magnetic recording","Reed-Solomon codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel Reed-Solomon codes","perpendicular magnetic recording channels","PMR channels","magnetic recording systems","soft-output Viterbi algorithm","SOVA","soft information","error correcting decoders","interleaved RS coding scheme","error event detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interleaved coding","multilevel coding","SOVA","RS codes","perpendicular magnetic recording","GMD decoding","Chase decoding","error-correction coding","ECC"]},{"kwd":["Chase decoding","error-correction coding","generalized minimum distance (GMD) decoding","interleaved coding","multilevel coding","perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR)","Reed\u2013Solomon (RS) codes","soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307210","abstract":"Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are commonly utilized in magnetic recording systems to correct error bursts.

The swarm of bioinspired nanomachines utilizes the blood distribution network and chemotaxis to carry drug through the vascular system to the cancer site, recognized by a high concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our approach is multi-scale and includes processes that occur both within cells and with their neighbors. The proposed bionanonetwork takes advantage of several organic processes, some of which already occur within the human body, such as a plate-like structure similar to those of red blood cells for more environmental contact; a berry fruit architecture for its internal multi-foams architecture; the penetrable structure of cancer cells, tissue, as well as the porous structure of the capillaries for drug penetration; state of glycocalyx for ligand-receptor adhesion; as well as changes in pH state of blood and O 2 release for nanomachine communication. For a more appropriate evaluation, we compare our work with a conventional chemotherapy approach using a mathematical model of cancer under actual experimental parameter settings. Simulation results show the merits of the proposed method in targeted cancer therapy by improving the densities of the relevant cancer cell types and VEGF concentration, while following more organic and natural processes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7374759/07307211.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2015.2489761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2015.2489761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bioinspired Nanonetworks for Targeted Cancer Drug Delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cancer","Drugs","Cells (biology)","Sensors","Mathematical model","Blood"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","blood","cancer","cellular biophysics","drug delivery systems","drugs","nanomedicine","pH"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer therapy","mathematical model","chemotherapy approach","nanomachine communication","pH state","ligand-receptor adhesion","glycocalyx","drug penetration","capillaries","porous structure","cancer cells","berry fruit architecture","red blood cells","human body","bionanonetwork","vascular endothelial growth factor","cancer site","vascular system","chemotaxis","blood distribution network","bioinspired nanomachines","targeted cancer drug delivery","biomimicry approach","bioinspired nanonetworks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bioinspired","biomimicry","chemotaxis","glycocalyx","nanonetworks","targeted cancer therapy"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Antineoplastic Agents","Cell Line, Tumor","Computer Simulation","Drug Delivery Systems","Humans","Models, Biological","Nanomedicine","Neoplastic Processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bioinspired Nanonetworks for Targeted Cancer Drug Delivery","volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7307211/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15717034","pubMedId":"26529771","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bioinspired Nanonetworks for Targeted Cancer Drug Delivery","sourcePdf":"tnb-akbarzadeht-2489761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112019S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7374759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7374759","articleId":"7307211","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307215,"authors":[{"name":"Marjan Zandi","affiliation":["School of Engineering Technology and Applied Science, Centennial College, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7307215/zandi-2495154-small.gif","p":["Marjan Zandi (S\u201913\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the Master\u2019s degree in information technology security from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Oshawa, ON, Canada, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, in 1994, 2007, and 2014, respectively.

Our goal is to design channel selection and access that can effectively adapt to a wide range of traffic load patterns in the primary network. We propose a distributed adaptive learning and access policy by applying stochastic learning automata (SLA), where each secondary user (SU) probabilistically chooses one of the most available channels to access, with the channel selection probabilities being updated based on the collision events. Our design includes two underlying distributed learning algorithms: learning of primary channel availabilities from each SU's own sensing history, and SLA-based learning of channel selection from each SU's own collision history for collision avoidance. We show that some existing distributed access policies can be viewed as special cases of our proposed adaptive policy, with a set of fixed channel selection probabilities. Next, we formulate the distributed channel selection and access problem as a noncooperative game. We show that it is an exact potential game with at least one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE). We prove that, under our proposed adaptive policy, the channel selection probabilities converge toward a pure strategy NE of the game. Simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive policy in a wide range of distributions of mean channel availabilities, as compared with other existing policies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837530","htmlLink":"/document/7307215/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Stochastic Learning and Adaptation to Primary Traffic for Dynamic Spectrum Access","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada"},{"fundingName":"NSERC Collaborative Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Stochastic Learning and Adaptation to Primary Traffic for Dynamic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"twc-dong-2495154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130861S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7307215","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7307218,"authors":[{"name":"Qingjiang Shi","affiliation":["Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, School of Info.

Assuming that the most common zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming scheme is employed by the base station, we aim to maximize the system energy efficiency in bits per Joule by joint beamforming and power splitting under both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints and energy harvesting constraints. The energy efficiency optimization (EEO) problem is nonconvex and very hard to solve. In this paper, by exploiting the problem structure, we first simplify the EEO problem to a joint transmit power allocation and receive power splitting problem. Then, with a tactful reformulation, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method coupled with Dinkelbach method to address the simplified EEO problem, whilst devising a nearly closed-form solution for the subproblems involved in the Dinkelbach method. It is proven that the proposed LR method is optimum under some condition and can guarantee at least a feasible solution, which is a notable advantage over the existing methods. Besides, we develop a low complexity EEO algorithm by proportionally distributing the total power to users. Finally, numerical results validate the excellent efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2489603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2489603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07307218.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization for MISO SWIPT Systems With Zero-Forcing Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Optimization for MISO SWIPT Systems With Zero-Forcing Beamforming","volume":"64","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307218/","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15719671","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307218/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Optimization for MISO SWIPT Systems With Zero-Forcing Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tsp-shi-2489603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136386S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7307218","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307219,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangdong Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7394983/7307219/7307219-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiangdong Huang (M\u201908) was born in 1979.

This design is derived from conventional frequency sampling method through replacing its frequency-domain interpolation function with the Fourier spectrum of a convolution window.

The above synthesizing process is equivalent to three simple steps, from which a closed-form formula of tap coefficients can be summarized. We further prove the proposed filter's five properties, from which a modified closed-form design without any redundant parameters is also derived. Numerical results show that, the transfer performance of the proposed design is comparable to the mainstream designs (such as WLS method, Parks- McClellan method).

Besides the important implications for the energy consumption, the trend towards densification requires the development of decentralized and sustainable radio resource management techniques. It is critically important to understand how the distribution of signal processing operations affects the energy efficiency of wireless networks. In this paper, we provide a cross-layer framework to evaluate and compare the energy efficiency of wireless networks under different levels of distribution of the signal processing load: 1) hybrid, where the signal processing operations are shared between nodes and APs; 2) centralized, where signal processing is entirely implemented at the APs; and 3) fully distributed, where all operations are performed by the nodes. We find that in practical wireless networks, hybrid signal processing exhibits a significant energy efficiency gain over both centralized and fully distributed approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Distributed Signal Processing in Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2494865","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07307220.pdf","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2494865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency of Distributed Signal Processing in Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7307220/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2016","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15719688","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency of Distributed Signal Processing in Wireless Networks: A Cross-Layer Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-geraci-2494865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139789S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7307220","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307221,"authors":[{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7307221/anliu-2494579-small.gif","p":["An Liu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201909) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2011 and 2004, respectively.

We assume complete perfect channel state information (CSI) at the SUs while only local instantaneous CSI is assumed at the PU. The PU is assumed to adopt an ON/OFF power allocation based on truncated channel inversion and convey this one-bit side information to all SUs. Based on these assumptions, we investigate the optimal probabilistic power allocation that seeks to maximize the system utilities for SUs subject to the primary interference power constraint, and the secondary rate outage constraints and the peak power constraints. The probabilistic power allocation problem was first reformulated as a non-convex deterministic power allocation problem. To handle the non-convex constraints, we proposed a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate solutions. Convergence analysis on the algorithm was also provided. To further reduce complexity, a decentralized version of the SCA algorithm was proposed. Extensive simulations validated our analyses and demonstrated that superior performance is indeed achieved by our proposed algorithms where the achieved utilities are close to the optimal values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307223/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","volume":"64","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15719676","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307223/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Networks With Outage Constraints and One-Bit Side Information","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002855","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of the Peoples Republic of China","grantNumber":"MOST103-2221-E-007-028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Networks With Outage Constraints and One-Bit Side Information","sourcePdf":"tsp-lin-2494852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086437S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7307223","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7307224,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Elghariani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7428982/7307224/elgha-2495163-small.gif","p":["Ali Elghariani (S\u201912\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Tripoli, Tripoli, Libya, and the Ph.D. degree in communications, networking, and signal processing from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University of West Lafayette, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 1999, 2008, and 2014, respectively.

The proposed techniques are developed from the conventional quadratic programming (QP) detector. The first one is based on performing two stages of a QP detector with a novel combination of both interference cancellation and shadow area constraints of the constellation. The second one is based on the branch and bound search tree algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is investigated at various QAM modulations. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithms outperform LAS and RTS algorithms in both uncoded and turbo coded BER performance, especially at higher QAM levels, with no significant change in complexity as the modulation level increases. Also, an extension of the QP detector for iterative detection and decoding is developed for the case of QPSK using a low complexity approach.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2495163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7428982/07307224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2495163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7428982","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Detection Algorithms in Large-Scale MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Detection Algorithms in Large-Scale MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307224/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15837504","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7307224/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE WCNC 2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Detection Algorithms in Large-Scale MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-elghariani-2495163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111069S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7307224","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307225,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An affine generation dispatch strategy is adopted to balance the system power uncertainty by several conventional generators, and thus the linear approximation of the cost function with respect to the power uncertainty is proposed to compute the quantile (which is also recognized as the value-at-risk) corresponding to a given probability value. The proposed model applies this quantile as the objective function and minimizes it to meet distinct probabilistic cost regulation purposes via properly selecting the given probability. In particular, the hedging effect due to the used affine generation dispatch is also thoroughly investigated. In addition, an analytical method to calculate probabilistic load flow (PLF) is developed with the probability density function of WPG, which is proposed to be approximated by a customized Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are easily obtained.

To deal with the potentially excessive interference originating from a plethora of geographically distributed transmission sources, a pair of transmission protocols based on interference alignment (IA) are conceived. The first, termed the full-IA, avoids all intra-cell interference (ICI) and other-cell interference by finding the perfect interference-nulling receive beamforming matrices (RxBFMs). The second protocol, termed partial-IA, only attempts to null the ICI. Employing the RxBFMs computed by either of these protocols mathematically decomposes the channel into a multiplicity of non-interfering multiple-input-single-output channels, which we term as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). The problem of finding the optimal SMCs as well as their power control variables for the ESEM problem considered is formally defined and converted into a convex optimization form with carefully selected variable relaxations and transformations. Thus, the optimal SMCs and power control variables can be distributively computed using both the classic dual decomposition and subgradient methods. Our results indicate that indeed, the ESEM algorithm performs better than the baseline equal power allocation algorithm in terms of its ESE. Furthermore, surprisingly the partial-IA outperforms the full-IA in all cases considered, which is because the partial-IA is less restrictive in terms of the number of available transmit dimensions at the transmitters. Given the typical cell sizes considered in this paper, the path-loss sufficiently attenuates the majority of the interference, and thus the full-IA over-compensates, when trying to avoid all possible sources of interference.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2488579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7381741/07307229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2488579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7381741","startPage":"882","endPage":"896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Energy Spectral Efficiency Optimization for Partial/Full Interference Alignment in Multi-user Multi-relay Multi-cell MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Energy Spectral Efficiency Optimization for Partial/Full Interference Alignment in Multi-user Multi-relay Multi-cell MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15719673","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7307229/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000690","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Energy Spectral Efficiency Optimization for Partial/Full Interference Alignment in Multi-user Multi-relay Multi-cell MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-hanzo-2488579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11745S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7381741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7381741","articleId":"7307229","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307230,"authors":[{"name":"Masood Parvania","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT"],"firstName":"Masood","lastName":"Parvania","orcid":"0000-0002-8891-7010","id":"38274397400"},{"name":"Anna Scaglione","affiliation":["Arizona State University, School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Tempe, AZ"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Scaglione","id":"37285169200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"7307230","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":851},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"abstract":"There is increasing evidence of shortage of ramping resources in the real-time operation of power systems. To explain and remedy this problem systematically, in this paper we take a novel look at the way the day-ahead unit commitment (UC) problem represents the information about load, generation and ramping constraints. We specifically investigate the approximation error made in mapping of the original problem, that would decide the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories of the committed generating units, onto the discrete-time problem that is solved in practice. We first show that current practice amounts to approximating the trajectories with linear splines. We then offer a different representation through cubic splines that provides physically feasible schedules and increases the accuracy of the continuous-time generation and ramping trajectories by capturing sub-hourly variations and ramping of load in the day-ahead power system operation. The corresponding day-ahead UC model is formulated as an instance of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), with the same number of binary variables as the traditional UC formulation. Numerical simulation over real load data from the California ISO demonstrate that the proposed UC model reduces the total day-ahead and real-time operation cost, and the number of events of ramping scarcity in the real-time operations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Polynomials","Splines (mathematics)","Load modeling","Schedules","Approximation methods","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","discrete time systems","integer programming","linear programming","power generation dispatch","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous-time generation","ramping trajectory models","day-ahead unit commitment problem","UC problem","ramping constraints","approximation error","discrete-time problem","linear splines","cubic splines","day-ahead power system operation","mixed-integer linear programming","MILP","real-time operation cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous-time function space","generation trajectory","mixed-integer linear programming","ramping trajectory","unit commitment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2479644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7463573/07307230.pdf","startPage":"3169","endPage":"3178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2479644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unit Commitment With Continuous-Time Generation and Ramping Trajectory Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unit Commitment With Continuous-Time Generation and Ramping Trajectory Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307230/","volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15985781","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unit Commitment With Continuous-Time Generation and Ramping Trajectory Models","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-parvania-2479644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041591S","chronDate":"July  2016","isNumber":"7463573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"40","articleId":"7307230","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":7307231,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xia","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xin Xia (M\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2014.","He is currently a Research Assistant Professor with the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

Bugs are reported, recorded, and managed in bug tracking systems such as Bugzilla. In general, a bug report contains many fields, such as product, component, severity, priority, fixer, operating system (OS), and platform, which provide important information for the bug triaging and fixing process. Our previous study finds that approximately 80% of bug reports have their fields reassigned and refined at least once, and bugs with reassigned and refined fields take more time to fix than bugs with no reassigned and refined fields. Thus, automatically predicting which bug report fields get reassigned and refined could help developers to save bug fixing time. Considering that a bug report could have multiple field reassignments and refinements (e.g., the product, component, fixer, and other fields of a bug report can get reassigned and refined), in this paper, we propose a multi-label learning algorithm to predict which bug report fields might be reassigned and refined. We note that the number of bug reports with some types of reassignment and refinement (e.g., bugs whose severity fields gets reassigned and refined) is a small proportion of the whole bug report collection, indicating the class imbalance problem. Thus, we propose imbalanced ML.KNN (Im-ML.KNN), which extends ML.KNN, one of the state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms, to achieve better performance. Im-ML.KNN is a composite model that combines 3 multi-label classifiers built using different types of features (i.e., meta, textual, and mixed features). We evaluate our solution on 4 large bug report datasets including OpenOffice, Netbeans, Eclipse, and Mozilla containing a total of 190,558 bug reports. We show that Im-ML.KNN can achieve an average F-measure score of 0.56-0.62. We also compare Im-ML.KNN with other state-of-art methods, such as the method proposed by Lamkanfi , ML.KNN, and HOMER-NB. The results show that Im-ML.KNN, on average, improves the average F-measure scores of Lamkanfi 's method, ML.KNN, and HOMER-NB by 119.69%, 9.11%, and 161.08%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2015.2484074","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/7556436/07307231.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2015.2484074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7556436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Bug Report Field Reassignment and Refinement Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Automated Bug Report Field Reassignment and Refinement Prediction","volume":"65","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16264989","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7307231/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Bug Report Field Reassignment and Refinement Prediction","sourcePdf":"tr-xia-2484074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151366S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7556436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7556436","articleId":"7307231","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7307232,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Xue","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Ying Xue received the B.Eng. degree in electronic electrical and systems engineering from the University of Birmingham in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering.

Dynamic series insertion of capacitors during commutation is utilized to increase the effective commutation voltage. The operating principles are presented followed by detailed mathematical analysis for both zero impedance single-phase and three-phase faults in order to select the required capacitor size and its voltage level. The performance of the proposed method is validated by simulation results in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the results show that the proposed converter configuration is able to eliminate commutation failures under both fault cases. Consequently partial power transferring capability during single-phase fault and fast fault recovery from three-phase fault can be achieved. Further simulation results show that the harmonic content of inverter AC voltage and current are not significantly increased and the voltage stress of the thyristor valve is comparable to that of the original benchmark system.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2491784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7463573/07307232.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2491784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463573","startPage":"3289","endPage":"3299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of Commutation Failures of LCC HVDC System with Controllable Capacitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of Commutation Failures of LCC HVDC System with Controllable Capacitors","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15985748","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7307232/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Elimination of Commutation Failures of LCC HVDC System with Controllable Capacitors","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2491784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059061S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7463573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7463573","articleId":"7307232","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307233,"authors":[{"name":"Morteza Rahimiyan","affiliation":["University of Shahrood, Shahrood, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7463573/7307233/7307233-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Morteza Rahimiyan (M'12) was born in Shahrood, Iran, in 1981.

Besides these demands, it also manages a wind-power plant and an energy storage facility. Demands, wind-power plant, and energy storage facility are interconnected within a small size electric energy system equipped with smart grid technology and constitute a virtual power plant that can strategically buy and sell energy in both the day-ahead and the real-time markets. To this end, we propose a two-stage procedure based on robust optimization. In the first stage, the bidding strategy in the day-ahead market is decided. In the second stage, and once the actual scheduling in the day-ahead market is known, we decide the bidding strategy in the real-time market for each hour of the day. We consider that the virtual power plant behaves as a price taker in these markets. Robust optimization is used to deal with uncertainties in wind-power production and market prices, which are represented through confidence bounds. Results of a realistic case study are provided to show the applicability of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategic Bidding for a Virtual Power Plant in the Day-Ahead and Real-Time Markets: A Price-Taker Robust Optimization Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2483781","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7463573/07307233.pdf","startPage":"2676","endPage":"2687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2483781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7463573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"Strategic Bidding for a Virtual Power Plant in the Day-Ahead and Real-Time Markets: A Price-Taker Robust Optimization Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7307233/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"15985807","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategic Bidding for a Virtual Power Plant in the Day-Ahead and Real-Time Markets: A Price-Taker Robust Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-rahimiyan-2483781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060295S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7463573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"7463573","articleId":"7307233","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7307234,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Chen","affiliation":["University of G\u00f6ttingen, Institute of Computer Science, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7590206/7307234/7307234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu Chen received the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China) in 2012, and worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Arizona State University, Tempe, USA from 2012 to 2014.

In this paper, we first study the multi-user computation offloading problem for mobile-edge cloud computing in a multi-channel wireless interference environment. We show that it is NP-hard to compute a centralized optimal solution, and hence adopt a game theoretic approach for achieving efficient computation offloading in a distributed manner. We formulate the distributed computation offloading decision making problem among mobile device users as a multi-user computation offloading game. We analyze the structural property of the game and show that the game admits a Nash equilibrium and possesses the finite improvement property. We then design a distributed computation offloading algorithm that can achieve a Nash equilibrium, derive the upper bound of the convergence time, and quantify its efficiency ratio over the centralized optimal solutions in terms of two important performance metrics. We further extend our study to the scenario of multi-user computation offloading in the multi-channel wireless contention environment. Numerical results corroborate that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior computation offloading performance and scale well as the user size increases.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2487344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2487344","startPage":"2795","endPage":"2808","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7590206/07307234.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Multi-User Computation Offloading for Mobile-Edge Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Multi-User Computation Offloading for Mobile-Edge Cloud Computing","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16378938","publicationDate":"October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7307234/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU FP7 IRSES MobileCloud Project Grant No","grantNumber":"612212"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61373128 and 61321491"},{"fundingName":"Sino-German Institutes of Social Computing"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Multi-User Computation Offloading for Mobile-Edge Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tnet-chen-2487344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075126S","chronDate":"October  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7590206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"1272","xplore-issue":"7590206","articleId":"7307234","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7307237,"authors":[{"name":"Zisheng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7426429/7307237/7307237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zisheng Zhang (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2010.","Currently, he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

This paper presents a novel patient-specific algorithm for prediction of seizures in epileptic patients from either one or two single-channel or bipolar channel intra-cranial or scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with low hardware complexity. Spectral power features are extracted and their ratios are computed. For each channel, a total of 44 features including 8 absolute spectral powers, 8 relative spectral powers and 28 spectral power ratios are extracted every two seconds using a 4-second window with a 50% overlap. These features are then ranked and selected in a patient-specific manner using a two-step feature selection. Selected features are further processed by a second-order Kalman filter and then input to a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The algorithm is tested on the intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) from the Freiburg database and scalp EEG (sEEG) from the MIT Physionet database. The Freiburg database contains 80 seizures among 18 patients in 427 hours of recordings. The MIT EEG database contains 78 seizures from 17 children in 647 hours of recordings. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve a sensitivity of 100% and an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.0324 per hour for the iEEG (Freiburg) database and a sensitivity of 98.68% and an average FPR of 0.0465 per hour for the sEEG (MIT) database. These results are obtained with leave-one-out cross-validation where the seizure being tested is always left out from the training set. The proposed algorithm also has a low complexity as the spectral powers can be computed using FFT. The area and power consumption of the proposed linear SVM are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less than a radial basis function kernel SVM (RBF-SVM) classifier. Furthermore, the total energy consumption of a system using linear SVM is reduced by 8% to 23% compared to system using RBF-SVM.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2477264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7426429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2477264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7426429/07307237.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Seizure Prediction From iEEG/sEEG Using Spectral Power and Ratios of Spectral Power","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Seizure Prediction From iEEG/sEEG Using Spectral Power and Ratios of Spectral Power","volume":"10","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307237/","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15835769","pubMedId":"26529783","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Seizure Prediction From iEEG/sEEG Using Spectral Power and Ratios of Spectral Power","sourcePdf":"tbcas-parhi-2477264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140246S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7426429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7426429","articleId":"7307237","onlineDate":"26 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307252,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoharu Nagashima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7307240/7307252/7307252-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tomoharu Nagashima (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from Chiba University, Chiba, Japan, in 2011, 2012, and 2015, respectively.","Since April 2015, he has been a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University, Japan.

In this paper, we contrast signal acquisition systems for low-rate applications based on analog CS encoding with systems based on digital CS encoding. We consider the complete signal chain from acquisition to reconstruction, with particular attention to the effects of quantization, and show that the two schemes differ significantly in encoder precision, measurement resolution, compression ratio, and reconstruction quality. Further, we develop first-order power estimation models to asses the relative energy-efficiency of different CS and conventional signal acquisition systems. Our numerical evaluations suggest that when the power consumption of data storage/communication outweighs the power consumption of data acquisition and processing, analog CS systems can outperform their digital counterparts, despite their higher hardware complexity. Moreover, we provide evidence that the common special case of analog and digital encoding, known as non-uniform sampler, performs best under all conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2015.2477579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7307240/07307256.pdf","startPage":"2718","endPage":"2729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2015.2477579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Analysis of Analog and Digital Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Analysis of Analog and Digital Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307256/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15568139","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307256/","volume":"62","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficiency Analysis of Analog and Digital Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensors","sourcePdf":"tcsi-bellasi-2477579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093316S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7307240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7307240","articleId":"7307256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307261,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7307240/7307261/7307261-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Cao (S\u201909) received his B.S. degree from Nanjing University, China, in 2008 and the M.E. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2010.

This paper presents a new low-cost CMOS image sensor based physical unclonable function (PUF) targeting a variety of security, privacy and trusted protocols that involves image sensor as a trusted entity. The proposed PUF exploits the intrinsic imperfection during the image sensor manufacturing process to generate unique and reliable digital signatures. The proposed differential readout stabilizes the response bits extracted from the random fixed pattern noises of selected pixel pairs determined by the applied challenge against supply voltage and temperature variations. The threshold of difference can be tightened to winnow out more unstable response bits from the challenge-response space offered by modern image sensors to enhance the reliability under harsher operating conditions and loosened to improve its resiliency against masquerade attacks in routine operating environment. The proposed design can be classified as a weak PUF which is resilient to modeling attacks, with direct access to its challenge-response pair restricted by the linear feedback shift register. Our experiments on the reset voltages extracted from a 64 \u00d7 64 image sensor fabricated in 180 nm 3.3 V CMOS technology demonstrated that robust and reliable challenge-response pairs can be generated with a uniqueness of 49.37% and a reliability of 99.80% under temperature variations of 15 ~ 115 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\nC and supply voltage variations of 3 ~ 3.6 V.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568152","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307261/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Image Sensor Based Physical Unclonable Function for Coherent Sensor-Level Authentication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS Image Sensor Based Physical Unclonable Function for Coherent Sensor-Level Authentication","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chang-2476318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129832S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7307240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7307240","articleId":"7307261","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307264,"authors":[{"name":"Schekeb Fateh","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET), ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7307240/7307264/7307264-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Schekeb Fateh (S\u201903) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich, Switzerland, in 2009.

This procedure is acceptable for a power system like that in Bangladesh where bona fide particulars is absent.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307365","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307365.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A numerical approach to estimate the actual demand of utility power in case of systematic data scarcity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A numerical approach to estimate the actual demand of utility power in case of systematic data scarcity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307365/","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15570426","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307365/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A numerical approach to estimate the actual demand of utility power in case of systematic data scarcity","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118151S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7307371,"authors":[{"name":"Tasnuva Hassan","affiliation":["United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Tasnuva","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37085713496"},{"name":"Haider Adnan Khan","affiliation":["United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Haider Adnan","lastName":"Khan","id":"37072471900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6676-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6675-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307371","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical computing","Optical imaging","Standards","Annealing","Face","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","handwritten character recognition","natural language processing","optical character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten Bangla numeral recognition","local binary pattern","computer vision applications","face recognition","k nearest neighbors classifier","LBP histograms","OCR system","CMATERdb 3.1.1"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Local Binary Pattern","Bangla Optical Character Recognition","Handwritten Character Recognition","Digit Recognition"]}],"abstract":"Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet robust texture descriptor that has been widely used in many computer vision applications including face recognition.

Data communication in VANETs is challenging due to its high mobility, short link lifetime, and frequent network fragmentation.

The use of Cognitive Radio (CR) can facilitate efficient spectrum utilization by Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). Besides, it allows the vehicles to use an existing road-side network infrastructure without interfering its users. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of designing efficient DSA techniques for CR-VANETs. We provide numerical simulation results to delineate the possible challenges of DSA in CR-VANETs. In addition, we highlight the features that a DSA algorithm must have to achieve good network performance. Finally, we point out the detailed procedure of evaluating the performance of DSA algorithms in CR-VANETs using discrete-event simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307399/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15570529","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307399/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigating the challenges of Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (CR-VANETs)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating the challenges of Dynamic Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radio-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (CR-VANETs)","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06427S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307409,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This paper presents our study about the effect of visibility on atmospheric attenuation in different weather conditions. Moreover, it also discusses the methodology to find out the optimum link distance for point-to-point FSO link which will be operated in different weather conditions.

Though the computational complexity of 2D convolution is comparatively high as it demands high level parallelism both for product and addition operations, it can be implemented on real time embedded system applications such as Application-Specific Integrated circuit (ASIC) or Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). As the convolved image directly depends on the kernel, proposed architecture is suitable for any kernel of 3\u00d73 size. The objective of this study is to implement and synthesize a FPGA base image processing system based on 2D convolution on the basis of microprocessor architecture Simple-as-Possible. This system was designed and simulated in Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL) and synthesized on Virtex-5 FPGA. The result shows that, the proposed design has lesser number of blocks (look up tables & registers) than other architecture and low time delay.

The Electromyography signal generates from the movement of brachioradialis muscle and antebrachial vein of lower portion of forearm as well as flexor carpi radialis tendon and flexor digitorum superficialis tendon of upper portion of wrist connected to forearm. In this study, various time and frequency domain features are extracted for analyzing motor unit recruitment with increased power of skeletal muscle and force produced by clenching muscles with maximum isometric contraction of the dominant forearm. The extracted time and time-frequency based features are used as the input vector for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based classification to classify different aged subjects according to their age group from teenager to old. A backpropagation algorithm with three feed forward neural network is used for training and testing the classification. The results show that the accuracy of classifying different aged people according to corresponding age group is perfect and significant.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307427","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307427.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age classification based on EMG signal using Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307427/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Age classification based on EMG signal using Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307427/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15570596","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age classification based on EMG signal using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082125S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7307428,"authors":[{"name":"Shanjida Khatun","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shanjida","lastName":"Khatun","id":"37085696816"},{"name":"Hasib Ul Alam","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Hasib","lastName":"Ul Alam","id":"37085697201"},{"name":"Swakkhar Shatabda","affiliation":["Department of CSE, United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Swakkhar","lastName":"Shatabda","id":"37085354176"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6676-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6675-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307428","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indium tin oxide","Phasor measurement units","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relative encoding scheme","heuristic search algorithm","pattern set mining","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pattern set mining","concept learning","genetic algorithm","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307428","abstract":"Working with exhaustive search on large dataset is infeasible for several reasons.

In order to accomplish these tasks, an OFDM system model has been considered where a random bit sequence is generated and subsequently converted into decimal value depending on the word size of the system. In order to simulate the system, the power delay profile of different wireless channels, numbers of carriers, window type, and symbol duration have been chosen as simulation parameters. The whole system has been analyzed by modeling a transmission-reception OFDM wireless system using MATLAB code for four different channels i.e. urban, rural, terrain and rician channel. Factors that affect the performance of an OFDM system such as multipath delay spread, channel noise, distortion of the signal (clipping), and timing requirements have also been measured. Our study reveals that, for each channel the system must satisfied the conditions of flat fading. It has been realized that for total symbol duration of 80 microseconds to 148 microseconds, the whole system gives a satisfactory result for terrain channel. In these range of symbol duration, the performance seems to be at least 120 microseconds of length.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307432","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307432.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Justifications of link adaptability of OFDM modulation scheme for different channel environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Justifications of link adaptability of OFDM modulation scheme for different channel environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307432/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15570565","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307432/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Justifications of link adaptability of OFDM modulation scheme for different channel environment","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060293S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307451,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.M.

Although Bangla is a major language in Indian subcontinent and is the first language of Bangladesh study regarding Bangla handwritten numeral recognition (BHNR) is very few with respect to other major languages such Roman. The existing BHNR methods uses distinct feature extraction techniques and various classification tools in their recognition schemes. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is found efficient for image classification with its distinct features. It also automatically provides some degree of translation invariance. In this paper, a CNN based BHNR is investigated. The proposed BHNR-CNN normalizes the written numeral images and then employ CNN to classify individual numerals. It does not employ any feature extraction method like other related works. 17000 hand written numerals with different shapes, sizes and variations are used in this study. The proposed method is shown satisfactory recognition accuracy and outperformed other prominent exiting methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307467","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307467.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bangla handwritten numeral recognition using convolutional neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Spatial databases","Character recognition","Image recognition","Accuracy","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","handwritten character recognition","image classification","natural language processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bangla handwritten numeral recognition","convolutional neural network","BHNR methods","feature extraction techniques","image classification tools","CNN","translation invariance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bangla Numeral","Convolutional Neural Network Handwritten Numeral Recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Bangla handwritten numeral recognition using convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307467/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15570499","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bangla handwritten numeral recognition using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072659S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7307470,"authors":[{"name":"Moyen-ul-Ahsan","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic & Communication Engineering, Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"lastName":"Moyen-ul-Ahsan","id":"37085706309"},{"name":"Manazir Ahasan Rifat","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic & Communication Engineering, Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Manazir Ahasan","lastName":"Rifat","id":"37085718159"},{"name":"Forhan-Bin-Emdad","affiliation":["Electrical, Electronic & Communication Engineering, Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"lastName":"Forhan-Bin-Emdad","id":"37085701852"},{"name":"S.

However the FSO links are severely degraded by the presence of smoke, fog, snow, cloud etc. which attenuates the optical signal and causes dispersion of the optical pulses. In this paper an analytical approach is presented to evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance of a FSO link in the presence of fog. Analysis is carried out to find the received optical power with field of view (FOV) of the transmitter to receiver as a parameter and other system parameters like transmitter power, wavelength, density of air etc. at a given bit rate considering on-off keying (OOK) modulation and direct detection receiver. The results are evaluated numerically in terms of SNR, BER and power penalty due to fog. Optimum FOV angle is determined corresponding to minimum BER at a given wavelength. It is noticed that FSO system suffer significant power penalty due to fog which is dependent on wavelength of optical carrier.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307470","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307470.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a Free Space Optical (FSO) communication system impaired by atmospheric effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307470","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a Free Space Optical (FSO) communication system impaired by atmospheric effects","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307470/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15570535","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307470/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a Free Space Optical (FSO) communication system impaired by atmospheric effects","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048617S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307475,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The cloud users hive away their valuable data in the cloud and perform their activity with the data. The security of these valuable data should be ensured. The side channel attack is one of the common attacks in cloud computing. Attackers use a malicious virtual machine to retrieve data from the cloud. In this paper, implements a randomly encrypted key generation algorithm against side channel attack in cloud computing. As anyone can use the cloud, it makes easy for the attackers to attack the desired users data. Also, a process has been developed that generates random keys to encrypt data of the cloud users at the time of storage and transmission. The attackers may find the encrypted data when they grab the users data that may no further value for them.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307475","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307475.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomly encrypted key generation algorithm against side channel attack in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307475/","displayDocTitle":"Randomly encrypted key generation algorithm against side channel attack in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15570601","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307475/","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomly encrypted key generation algorithm against side channel attack in cloud computing","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063526S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307489,"authors":[{"name":"Fariha Afsana","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology Jahangimagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Fariha","lastName":"Afsana","id":"37085359712"},{"name":"Nusrat Jahan","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology Jahangimagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Nusrat","lastName":"Jahan","id":"38203078100"},{"name":"Farhana A.

A set of cognitive radio nodes form a cluster based on minimum normalized distance and sensed common free channels. Cluster Head Election Cost (CHEC) is used to determine Cluster Head and Secondary Cluster Head. It also reduces delay for different network sizes compared to random handoff process.

In image compression we use JPEG where huge number of zero is generated in medium and high frequency region of transformed image using the combination of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) and quantization. This is done to take the advantage of `run-length coding' to reduce the size of an image. The process is lossy compression but provide good illusion at a glance. In this paper we use Haar wavelet matrix instead of DCT to transform the image into frequency domain. Again instead of weighting matrix of quantization, we use mask of very few 1s in DC and low frequency region to get huge number of 0 in each block of transformed image. The image is recovered using of IDWT (Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform) and the MSE (mean square error) and SNR (signal to noise ratio) are measured varying the percentage of zero per block or mask.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology

Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) domain. The total experiment is carried out with the publicly available benchmark BCI-competition 2003 Graz motor imagery dataset. First, the EEG signals are decomposed into several bands of real and imaginary coefficients, and then, some statistical features like norm entropy and standard deviation have been calculated. From the one way ANOVA analysis, these features have been shown to be promising to distinguish various kinds of EEG signals. Various types of classifiers have been developed to realize the discrimination among the EEG signals. Among various types of classifiers, K-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based classifiers have been shown to provide a good accuracy of 90.36% which is shown to be better than several existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307506","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307506.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motor imagery movements detection of EEG signals using statistical features in the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307506/","displayDocTitle":"Motor imagery movements detection of EEG signals using statistical features in the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform domain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15570515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307506/","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motor imagery movements detection of EEG signals using statistical features in the Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform domain","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106301S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307511,"authors":[{"name":"Sidratul Moontaha","affiliation":["Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Sidratul","lastName":"Moontaha","id":"37085738272"},{"name":"Farhana Akter","affiliation":["Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Farhana","lastName":"Akter","id":"37085723178"},{"name":"Farhana Rahman","affiliation":["Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Farhana","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085730690"},{"name":"A.

In this work, an algorithm that uses single lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect OSA events is propounded. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, it proposes an automatic OSA detection algorithm using Empirical Mode Decomposition, higher order statistical features and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Second, ELM is introduced in this work and this is the first time ELM has been applied to OSA detection. Experimental outcomes backed by statistical validation evinces that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing ones in accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7299991/7307334/07307522.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Communication Technology (ICEEICT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT.2015.7307522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea from single-lead Electrocardiogram","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Neurons","Yttrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical disorders","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","portable instruments","sleep"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic screening","obstructive sleep apnea","single-lead electrocardiogram","multiple channel physiological signal","apnea event detection","OSA diagnosis","automatic OSA screening system","portable home sleep monitoring system","empirical mode decomposition","statistical features","extreme learning machine","statistical validation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea from single-lead Electrocardiogram","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307522/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15570549","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea from single-lead Electrocardiogram","confLoc":"Savar, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"Paper658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116499S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7299991","isNumber":"7307334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7299991","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7307334","articleId":"7307522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307530,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The OpenCL specification tightly binds its workflow abstraction, or \"command queue,\" to a specific device for the entire program. For best performance, the user has to find the ideal queue -- device mapping at command queue creation time, an effort that requires a thorough understanding of the match between the characteristics of all the underlying device architectures and the kernels in the program. In this paper, we propose to add scheduling attributes to the OpenCL context and command queue objects that can be leveraged by an intelligent runtime scheduler to automatically perform ideal queue - device mapping. Our proposed extensions enable the average OpenCL programmer to focus on the algorithm design rather than scheduling and automatically gain performance without sacrificing programmability. As an example, we design and implement an OpenCL runtime for task-parallel workloads, called MultiCL, which efficiently schedules command queues across devices. Within MultiCL, we implement several key optimizations to reduce runtime overhead. Our case studies include the SNU-NPB OpenCL benchmark suite and a real-world seismology simulation. We show that, on average, users have to apply our proposed scheduler extensions to only four source lines of code in existing OpenCL applications in order to automatically benefit from our runtime optimizations. We also show that MultiCL always maps command queues to the optimal device set with negligible runtime overhead.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Runtime","Performance evaluation","Processor scheduling","Context","Schedules","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer interfaces","multiprocessing systems","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic command queue scheduling","task-parallel workloads","heterogeneous compute devices","portable interface","cluster nodes","workflow abstraction","queue-device mapping","command queue creation time","device architectures","intelligent runtime scheduler","MultiCL","SNU-NPB OpenCL benchmark suite","real-world seismology simulation","source lines","runtime optimizations","optimal device set","runtime overhead","open computing language","high-performance computing clusters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenCL","Runtime Systems","Scheduling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307562","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2015.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307300/7307539/07307562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2015.15","startPage":"42","endPage":"51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307539","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Command Queue Scheduling for Task-Parallel Workloads in OpenCL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Command Queue Scheduling for Task-Parallel Workloads in OpenCL","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307562/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307562/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15570893","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Command Queue Scheduling for Task-Parallel Workloads in OpenCL","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"6598a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068618S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307300","isNumber":"7307539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307300","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7307539","articleId":"7307562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7307584,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Behzad","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Behzad","id":"38233874100"},{"name":"Surendra Byna","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA"],"firstName":"Surendra","lastName":"Byna","id":"37085862825"},{"name":"Stefan M.

The most common layers include high-level I/O libraries, MPI-IO middleware, and parallel file system. Each of these layers offers various tunable parameters to control intermediary data transfer points and the final data layout. Due to the interdependencies and the number of combinations of parameters, finding a good set of parameter values for a specific application's I/O pattern is challenging. Recent efforts, such as autotuning with genetic algorithms (GAs) and analytical models, have several limitations. For instance, analytical models fail to capture the dynamic nature of shared supercomputing systems and are application-specific. GA-based tuning requires running many time-consuming experiments for each input size. In this paper, we present a strategy to generate automatically an empirical model for a given application pattern. Using a set of real measurements from running an I/O kernel as training set, we generate a nonlinear regression model. We use this model to predict the top-20 tunable parameter values that give efficient I/O performance and rerun the I/O kernel to select the best set of parameter under the current conditions as tunable parameters for future runs of the same I/O kernel. Using this approach, we demonstrate 6X - 94X speedup over default I/O time for different I/O kernels running on multiple HPC systems. We also evaluate performance by identifying interdependencies among different sets of tunable parameters.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2015.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2015.37","startPage":"184","endPage":"193","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307300/7307539/07307584.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Model-Driven Parallel I/O Performance Tuning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Model-Driven Parallel I/O Performance Tuning","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307584/","accessionNumber":"15570902","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307584/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Model-Driven Parallel I/O Performance Tuning","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"6598a184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097275S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307300","isNumber":"7307539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307300","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7307539","articleId":"7307584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7307626,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ma","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085697564"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085437216"},{"name":"Qi Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085698846"},{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37406918700"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406428200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6598-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-5244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-9253"}],"articleNumber":"7307626","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Collaboration","Filtering","Buffer storage","Acceleration","Graphics processing units","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","collaborative filtering","field programmable gate arrays","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based accelerator","neighborhood-based collaborative filtering","recommendation algorithms","CF","personalized recommender systems","big data","cloud computing","graphic processing unit","GPU","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["accelerator","FPGA","recommendation algorithm","neighborhood-based collaborative filtering","heterogeneous"]}],"abstract":"Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a kind of techniques in the field of recommendation algorithms and has been widely used in lots of personalized recommender systems.

HRSC methods form a key scientific kernel for compressible inviscid solvers that appear in astrophysics and engineering applications and tend to require enormous memory and computing resources.

A problem when analyzing hyperspectral images is that their spatial resolution is generally not enough to separate different spectrally pure constituents (endmembers); as a result, several of them can be found in the same pixel. Spectral unmixing is an important technique for hyperspectral data exploitation, aimed at finding the spectral signatures of the endmembers and their associated abundance fractions. The development of techniques able to provide unmixing results in real-time is a long desired goal in the hyperspectral imaging community. In this paper, we describe a real-time hyperspectral unmixing chain based on three main steps: 1) estimation of the number of endmembers using the hyperspectral subspace identification with minimum error (HySime); 2) estimation of the spectral signatures of the endmembers using the vertex component analysis (VCA); and 3) unconstrained abundance estimation. We have developed new parallel implementations of the aforementioned algorithms and assembled them in a fully operative real-time unmixing chain using graphics processing units (GPUs), exploiting NVIDIA's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) and its basic linear algebra subroutines (CuBLAS) library, as well as OpenMP and BLAS for multicore parallelization. As a result, our real-time chain exploits both CPU (multicore) and GPU paradigms in the optimization. Our experiments reveal that this hybrid GPU-CPU parallel implementation fully meets real-time constraints in hyperspectral imaging applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2485399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7404297/07307749.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2485399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid CPU\u2013GPU Real-Time Hyperspectral Unmixing Chain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307749/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid CPU\u2013GPU Real-Time Hyperspectral Unmixing Chain","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15775346","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307749/","dateOfInsertion":"11 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid CPU\u2013GPU Real-Time Hyperspectral Unmixing Chain","sourcePdf":"jstars-leporati-2485399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083716S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7404297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7404297","articleId":"7307749","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307799,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["InIT - Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085630230"},{"name":"Jens Eickmeyer","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IOSB-INA, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Eickmeyer","id":"37085631261"},{"name":"Oliver Niggemann","affiliation":["InIT - Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany","Fraunhofer IOSB-INA, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Niggemann","id":"37541180300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9200-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9199-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307799","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Data models","Wind power generation","Clustering algorithms","Principal component analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","cost reduction","maintenance engineering","pattern clustering","power engineering computing","power generation economics","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven condition monitoring","wind power plants","WPP","cluster analysis","wind energy sector","wind energy cost reduction","anomaly detection","maintenance plan optimization","downtime reduction","system level condition monitoring","clustering algorithms","normal behavior model"]}],"abstract":"Along with the rapid growth of the wind energy sector, reducing the wind energy costs caused by unplanned downtimes and maintenances has aroused great concern of researchers. Condition monitoring system (CMS) is widely used for detecting anomalies of wind power plants (WPPs) so as to reduce the downtimes and optimize the maintenance plan. However, current solutions to condition monitoring of WPPs focus mostly on detecting a particular anomaly on a single component or a subsystem. Optimizing the maintenance plan of whole wind power plant requires a solution to system level condition monitoring of WPPs. This paper gives an approach for system level condition monitoring of WPPs using data driven method, that provides an overall picture of the system statuses. Firstly, cluster analysis is utilized to automatically learn the normal behavior model of WPPs from the observations. Two clustering algorithms are explored to choose a suitable one for modeling the WPPs. The presented anomaly detection algorithm uses the learned model as reference to detect the system anomalies. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated with real world data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.16","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307799.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"136","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Driven Condition Monitoring of Wind Power Plants Using Cluster Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Data Driven Condition Monitoring of Wind Power Plants Using Cluster Analysis","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571089","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Driven Condition Monitoring of Wind Power Plants Using Cluster Analysis","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"9200a131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074249S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307709","isNumber":"7307766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307709","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7307766","articleId":"7307799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7307802,"authors":[{"name":"Buhua Chen","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Buhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085608800"},{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37065178000"},{"name":"Hongwei Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292094700"},{"name":"Xuefeng Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuefeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38024881800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9200-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9199-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307802","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307802","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Color","Graphics processing units","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","graph colouring","mathematics computing","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel genetic algorithm","graph coloring problem","CUDA","GCP","NP-hard problem","polynomial time","compute unified device architecture","initialization operator","crossover operator","mutation operator","selection operator","parallel threads","benchmark graphs","convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["graph coloring problem","best individual preservation method","parallel genetic algorithm","CUDA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.33","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307802.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Graph Coloring Problem Based on CUDA","abstract":"Graph coloring problem (GCP) has proven to be an NP hard problem, until now there is no way to solve it in polynomial time.

In this model, task-technology fit and technology-organization compatibility are considered as two key factors for the alignment between cloud computing and enterprise business. Further the alignment is evaluated from two aspects: the depth of alignment and the breadth of alignment. Analyzing data collected via questionnaires with Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) and Partial Least Squares (PLS), this paper shows that the technology-organization compatibility has significant positive effects on both depth and breadth of cloud computing alignment. On the other hand, the task-technology fit has significant positive effects on breadth of cloud computing alignment, and it has no significant effects on depth of cloud computing alignment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307825.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"272","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical Study on Alignment of Cloud Computing in Enterprises","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Reliability","Companies","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","data analysis","least mean squares methods","organisational aspects","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["organizational fit","information technology","IT","task-technology fit","technology-organization compatibility","enterprise business","data analysis","statistical product and service solutions","SPSS","partial least squares","PLS","cloud computing alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Alignment","Enterprise User"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Study on Alignment of Cloud Computing in Enterprises","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307825/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571114","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Study on Alignment of Cloud Computing in Enterprises","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"9200a268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069485S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307709","isNumber":"7307766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307709","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7307766","articleId":"7307825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307846,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Peng Tao","affiliation":["School of Integrated Circuits, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Peng","lastName":"Tao","id":"37085760472"},{"name":"Wei-Ping Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, Shenzhen State Micro Electronics Co., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Ping","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085765635"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9200-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9199-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307846","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1765},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307846","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Power demand","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Inverters","Semiconductor device modeling","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","logic design","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sense amplifier design","latch-type SRAM sense amplifier","static random access memory","high speed SRAM","low voltage low power SRAM application","CMOS technology","complimentary metal oxide semiconductors","voltage 1.0 V","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","sense amplifier","low power","high speed","simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.32","endPage":"387","startPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Sense Amplifier in the High Speed SRAM","abstract":"Basic structure of latch-type SRAM sense amplifier is analyzed and advantages and disadvantages are compared in this paper, then an improved latch-type SRAM sense amplifier is presented.

To obtain good trade-off between the system throughput and transmission performance, we investigate joint user grouping and resource allocation under the consideration of system throughput and average MSE performance in uplink SC-FDMA systems. Based on linear MIMO detection, we first develop MSE-oriented user grouping criterion for evaluation of transmission performance, then propose a dynamic user grouping and optimal resource allocation algorithm with elastic average MSE constraint.

Experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve better performance.","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.91","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307863.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","startPage":"477","endPage":"480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Off-Line Implementation of OFDM in a Visible Light Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Off-Line Implementation of OFDM in a Visible Light Communication System","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307863/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571117","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7307863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Off-Line Implementation of OFDM in a Visible Light Communication System","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"9200a477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040636S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307709","isNumber":"7307766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307709","xplore-issue":"7307766","articleId":"7307863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307869,"authors":[{"name":"Junbo Hua","affiliation":["ISN Lab, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Junbo","lastName":"Hua","id":"37085404687"},{"name":"Ningning Jiang","affiliation":["ISN Lab, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Ningning","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085400764"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9200-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9199-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307869","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Quality of service","Estimation","Cognitive radio","Licenses","Queueing analysis","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","quality of service","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS performance analysis","secondary user","overlay cognitive radio networks","spectrum allocation","quality of service","spectrum occupancy","multiple primary user","average queue length"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","Markov model","Average queue length","Multi-users","Multi-channels"]}],"abstract":"In the cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the reliability, the efficiency and the fairness of the spectrum allocation is highly related to the quality of service (QoS) performance for the users. But in the overlay CRNs the QoS performance for the SUs is difficult to obtain due to the inherent opportunistic property of the spectrum resources for the SU's data transmission. Since the spectrum occupancy states by the PUs are often characterized by Markov models, Markov-chain based analysis is commonly performed to analyze the QoS performance for the SUs. In this paper we consider an overlay CRN with multi-PUs where each PU's data transmission follows M/M/c model and the SU has little limitation on the choice of the channels. An approximate estimation method of the average queue length for the SU is proposed here. Numerical simulations show that this method can achieve pretty accurate estimation in some scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.55","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307869.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.55","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","startPage":"513","endPage":"516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS Performance Analysis for the Second User in the Overlay Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"QoS Performance Analysis for the Second User in the Overlay Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307869/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7307869/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15571093","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS Performance Analysis for the Second User in the Overlay Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"9200a513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081647S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307709","isNumber":"7307766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307709","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7307766","articleId":"7307869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307872,"authors":[{"name":"Long Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085416033"},{"name":"Liusheng Huang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Liusheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37280053300"},{"name":"Hongli Xu","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Hongli","lastName":"Xu","id":"37291048300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9200-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-9199-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7307872","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Interference","Cognitive radio","Dynamic spectrum access","Queueing analysis","Process control","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","multi-access systems","queueing theory","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["queuing-theoretical multi-user spectrum sensing and access","multi-channel cognitive radio networks","wireless communications","spectrum resource","spectrum efficiency","cognitive networks","secondary users","primary users","quality of service","spectrum detection","spectrum sharing","multiuser spectrum sensing","multichannel spectrum access mechanism","queuing theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","Spectrum access","Spectrum sensing","Spectrum sharing","Queuing theory"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queuing-Theoretical Multi-user Spectrum Sensing and Access in Multi-channel Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2015.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307766","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307709/7307766/07307872.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2015.78","startPage":"529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307872","abstract":"The rapid growth of wireless communications has made the spectrum resource becoming more and more scarcity. The concept of cognitive radio was proposed to address the issue of spectrum efficiency and had been receiving an increasing attention in recent years. In the cognitive networks, the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to sense, detect and access the frequency bands that are not currently being in use by primary users (PUs). SUs must equip with the spectrum sensing and access technology to utilize the spectrum resource and guarantee PUs' communication quality of service. Most former works study spectrum sensing or spectrum access respectively. And, when there are multiple SUs and multiple channels, the spectrum detection and spectrum sharing must be considered. In this paper, we propose a framework of multi-user spectrum sensing and multichannel spectrum access mechanism for the SUs confronting with unknown primary behavior. We also study the interference to PUs caused by the dynamic access and the inaccurate spectrum sensing. We analysis the interference caused by SUs through utilizing renewal process theory and derive the corresponding closed-form expressions. Under the constraints of the interference to PUs and the secondary network's stability, the queuing theory is utilized to obtain the maximum ave.rage data rate of SUs under the inaccurate spectrum sensing. Through lots of simulations, we verify the effectiveness of our analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571094","htmlLink":"/document/7307872/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Queuing-Theoretical Multi-user Spectrum Sensing and Access in Multi-channel Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queuing-Theoretical Multi-user Spectrum Sensing and Access in Multi-channel Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"9200a529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084802S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307709","isNumber":"7307766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307709","xplore-issue":"7307766","articleId":"7307872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7307939,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Ranjbar Zefreh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Mahdi Ranjbar Zefreh (S\u201913) was born in Isfahan, Iran, on\n October 1, 1981.

The first three moments of the random decision variable Y are obtained in the context of the above OCDMA system and subsequently used in an appropriate Log-Pearson type 3 (LP3) distribution to represent the random decision variable Y. Multiple access interference (MAI) and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noises are taken into account to obtain the bit error rate of the system.

In this context, performance comparison of the system based on power-cubic preprocessor and systems employing power-quadratic nonlinear optical thresholders, such as second harmonic generation crystals, are discussed.

This scheme enables high-speed OFDM to Nyquist-WDM conversion without complex optical/electrical/optical conversion. The all-optical OFDM transmitter is based on the generation of OFDM symbols with a low duty cycle by rectangular temporal gating, which in combination with optical time-division multiplexing yields a higher symbol-rate OFDM signal. In the receiver, the converted Nyquist-WDM super-channel is WDM demultiplexed into individual Nyquist-WDM channels using a rectangular optical bandpass filter, followed by optical sampling at the intersymbol-interference free point. In the experimental demonstration, a single-polarization 8-subcarrier 640 Gb/s differential phase-shift keying OFDM super-channel with a spectral efficiency (SE) of 0.8 symbol/s/Hz is generated. The OFDM super-channel is then converted to eight 80-Gb/s Nyquist-WDM channels by complete OFT. The complete OFT is based on two quadratic phase-modulation stages using four-wave mixing, separated by a dispersive medium.

To meet the MTC security requirements, the access authentication processing of MTC devices needs to follow the evolved packet system-authentication and key agreement (EPS-AKA), a protocol defined in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) standard. However, in the emergence of group-based communication scenarios, an independent authentication processing for each MTC device will cause signal congestion in the networks. In addition, the access-policy updating has always been an issue when constructing authentication schemes. In this paper, we propose a group-based AKA (GR-AKA) protocol with dynamic policy updating. Specifically, we choose an asynchronous secret share scheme combining with Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme to implement distributed authentication and session key establishment in the LTE-A networks, and to achieve dynamic MTC-device access authority updating. Compared with other authentication protocols in the LTE-A networks, our method could not only authenticate several MTC devices simultaneously but also dynamically update the access-policy to control the access authority of MTC devices. Extensive analysis and experiment results have shown the efficiency and efficacy of proposed protocol.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7467596/07307948.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2495321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2495321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7467596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-Based Authentication and Key Agreement With Dynamic Policy Updating for MTC in LTE-A Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Protocols","Yttrium","Resists","Servers","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication standards","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authentication protocol","dynamic MTC-device access authority updating","session key establishment","distributed authentication","Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme","asynchronous secret share scheme","GR-AKA protocol","group-based AKA","access-policy","signal congestion","independent authentication processing","group-based communication","3GPP standard","third generation partnership project","EPS-AKA","evolved packet system-authentication and key agreement","access authentication processing","MTC security","Long-Term Evaluation advanced network","mobile communication approach","machine type communication","LTE-A network","dynamic policy updating","group-based authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Group authentication","Key agreement","Access control,","MTC","LTE-A"]},{"kwd":["Access control","group authentication","key agreement","long-term evaluation-advanced (LTE-A)","machine type communication (MTC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Group-Based Authentication and Key Agreement With Dynamic Policy Updating for MTC in LTE-A Networks","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7307948/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15985617","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572310"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003395","fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"14YZ129"},{"fundingName":"Start-up Fund for Talent Introduction of Shanghai University of Electric Power","grantNumber":"K2015-008"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars","grantNumber":"[2014]1685"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-Based Authentication and Key Agreement With Dynamic Policy Updating for MTC in LTE-A Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-li-2495321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067611S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7467596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7467596","articleId":"7307948","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7307953,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The problem is tackled under the integral quadratic constraint (IQC) framework, where the \u201caperiodic sampling operation\u201d is modelled by an \u201cdelay-integration\u201d operator. Characterization based on integral quadratic constrains (IQC) is identified for this operator and the IQC theory is applied to derive convex stability criteria. Compared to the dominating Lyapunov approach where the candidate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals or looped functionals need to be tailored for the systems under consideration and therefore the stability conditions need to be re-derived whenever additional uncertainties are considered, the proposed approach has the advantage of avoiding such endeavor. Numerical examples are given to illustrate this main point and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16180635","volume":"61","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7307957/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An IQC Approach to Robust Stability of Aperiodic Sampled-Data Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-110-044"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IQC Approach to Robust Stability of Aperiodic Sampled-Data Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-kao-2495559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085574S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7523352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7523352","articleId":"7307957","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":7307960,"authors":[{"name":"Yueling Che","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yueling","lastName":"Che","id":"37719526100"},{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37077980100"},{"name":"Lingjie Duan","affiliation":["Engineering Systems and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lingjie","lastName":"Duan","id":"37404722200"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["A*STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274563900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7307960","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":880},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7307960","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Array signal processing","Interference","Communication system security","Energy harvesting","Throughput","Energy exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cochannel interference","radiofrequency power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","optimal energy beamforming","information receiver","energy transmitter","WET","wireless energy transfer","wireless device","information transfer","cochannel energy transfer","WPC system","multiantenna wireless powered communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless powered communication (WPC)","cochannel energy and information","multi-antenna","cochannel interference"]},{"kwd":["Wireless powered communication (WPC)","co-channel energy and information transfer","multi-antenna","co-channel interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2495187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07307960.pdf","startPage":"2266","endPage":"2269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2495187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiantenna Wireless Powered Communication With Cochannel Energy and Information Transfer","abstract":"This letter studies a multiantenna wireless powered communication (WPC) system with cochannel energy and information transfer, where a wireless device (WD), powered up by wireless energy transfer (WET) from an energy transmitter (ET), communicates to an information receiver (IR) over the same frequency band.

Large (e.g., 1 GB) pages or direct segments can alleviate this penalty due to page table walks, but at the same time such a strategy exposes the organizational and operational details of modern DRAM-based memory systems to applications. Row-buffer conflicts caused by accesses heading to the same DRAM bank but different rows from multiple threads are regarded as the main culprits behind the very large gaps between peak and achieved main memory throughput, but hardware-based approaches in memory controllers have achieved only limited success whereas existing proposals that change memory allocators cannot be applied to large pages or direct segments. In this paper, we propose a set of application-level techniques to improve the effective main memory bandwidth. The techniques stem from the two key observations that 1) each thread of an application exclusively accesses certain datasets for a short or long period of time, and 2) superfluous memory reads originating from a cache's write allocation policy can be avoided if scatters during the data shuffling pass through intermediate cache-friendly buffers. Experiments with a contemporary x86 server show that combining large pages with the proposed address linearization, bank coloring, and write streaming techniques improves the performance of the three big memory applications of high-throughput key-value store, fast-Fourier transform, and radix sort by 37.6, 22.9, and 68.1 percent, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec. 1 2016","volume":"15","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16560853","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7307975/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large Pages on Steroids: Small Ideas to Accelerate Big Memory Applications","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingName":"Korea government","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A1A11052936 and NRF-2012M3A9D1054622"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Pages on Steroids: Small Ideas to Accelerate Big Memory Applications","sourcePdf":"lca-ahn-2495103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072184S","chronDate":"July-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"7797573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7797573","articleId":"7307975","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7307976,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The scheduler aims at maximizing the throughput while maintaining access proportional fairness (APF) among users as well as MNOs. Normalized signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) selection criterion is used to impose APF between the users of each MNO, while APF between MNOs is maintained by assigning different weights to the normalized SNRs. The optimal weights for all MNOs are computed offline using iterative search method. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can maintain APF at the user and MNO levels. Moreover, the throughput of the proposed scheduler is consistently higher than in the static sharing scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7307976/","volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7307976/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15802508","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Low-Complexity Scheduler for Wireless Resource Virtualization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Low-Complexity Scheduler for Wireless Resource Virtualization","sourcePdf":"lwc-kalil-2495206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073419S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7412801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7412801","articleId":"7307976","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7307987,"authors":[{"name":"Zong-Hao Ye","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zong-Hao","lastName":"Ye","id":"38339378900"},{"name":"Kuei-Shu Chang-Liao","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuei-Shu","lastName":"Chang-Liao","id":"38272104100"},{"name":"Li-Jung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Jung","lastName":"Liu","id":"38277680600"},{"name":"Jen-Wei Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Wei","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38469048400"},{"name":"Hsin-Kai Fang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and System Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Kai","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085666032"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"7307987","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aluminum oxide","Tunneling","Germanium","High K dielectric materials","Flash memories","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclotron resonance","electron traps","flash memories","germanium compounds","hole traps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electron cyclotron resonance","interface layer","endurance characteristics","charge trapping flash memory","erasing speed","programming speed","GeO2","GeON","AlON"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charge-trapping flash device","Ge-channel","interfacial layer","stacked high-k"]},{"kwd":["Charge-trapping flash device","Ge-channel","interfacial layer","stacked high-k"]}],"abstract":"Charge-trapping (CT) flash memory devices with Ge channel are studied for the first time.

These applications exercise the hardware differently depending on the computation task, generating varying workloads with time. Energy minimization with such workload and performance variations within (intra) and across (inter) applications is particularly challenging. To address this challenge, we propose an online approach, capable of minimizing energy through adaptation to these variations. At the core of this approach is a reinforcement learning algorithm that suitably selects the appropriate voltage/frequency scaling (VFS) based on workload predictions to meet the applications' performance requirements. The adaptation is then facilitated and expedited through learning transfer, which uses the interaction between the application, runtime, and hardware layers to adjust the VFS. The proposed approach is implemented as a power governor in Linux and extensively validated on an ARM Cortex-A8 running different benchmark applications. We show that with intra- and inter-application variations, our proposed approach can effectively minimize energy consumption by up to 33% compared to the existing approaches. Scaling the approach to multicore systems, we also demonstrate that it can minimize energy by up to 18% with 2\u00d7 reduction in the learning time when compared with an existing approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2481867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7471560/07308001.pdf","startPage":"877","endPage":"890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7471560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2481867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Transfer-Based Adaptive Energy Minimization in Embedded Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Learning Transfer-Based Adaptive Energy Minimization in Embedded Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308001/","publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16002762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308001/","volume":"35","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, U.K. (PRiME Project)","grantNumber":"EP/K034448/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Transfer-Based Adaptive Energy Minimization in Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"tcad-shafik-2481867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120734S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7471560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7471560","articleId":"7308001","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7308004,"authors":[{"name":"David Buckley","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/7879187/7308004/7308004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Buckley received the B.Sc. degree (with first-class honors) in 2011 from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., where he is a currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science.","His research mainly concerns adapting games to match player skill, with a focus on first-person shooters.

Yet, while game difficulty and player learning have been explored in the context of games, there has been little work analyzing skill per se, and how this is related to the interaction of a player with the controls of the game - the player's input. To this end, we present a data set of 476 game logs from over 40 players of a first-person shooter game (Red Eclipse) as a basis of a case study. We then extract features from the keyboard and mouse input and provide an analysis in relation to skill. Finally, we show that a player's skill can be predicted using less than a minute of their keyboard presses. We suggest that the techniques used here are useful for adapting games to match players' skill levels rapidly, arguably more rapidly than solutions based on performance averaging such as TrueSkill.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel7/4804728/7879187/07308004.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2494849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2494849","startPage":"63","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid Skill Capture in a First-Person Shooter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308004/","displayDocTitle":"Rapid Skill Capture in a First-Person Shooter","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308004/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16759835","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Rapid Skill Capture in a First-Person Shooter","sourcePdf":"tciaig-buckley-2494849-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101706S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"7879187","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7879187","articleId":"7308004","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7308006,"authors":[{"name":"Yongping Pan","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yongping","lastName":"Pan","id":"38063351100"},{"name":"Haoyong Yu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Haoyong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37711526800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7308006","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1615},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Asymptotic stability","Uncertainty","Control theory","Stability","Closed loop systems","Observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","asymptotic stability","feedback","nonlinear control systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite learning","adaptive dynamic surface control","persistent excitation","PE","strict-feedback nonlinear systems","parametric uncertainties","parameter convergence","online recorded data","instantaneous data","prediction error generation","tracking errors","prediction errors","output-feedback case","nonlinear separation principle","interval-excitation condition","asymptotic stability","exponential stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","composite learning","interval excitation","mismatched uncertainty","parameter convergence"]}],"abstract":"In the conventional adaptive control, a stringent condition named persistent excitation (PE) must be satisfied to guarantee parameter convergence. This technical note focuses on adaptive dynamic surface control for a class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties, where a novel technique coined composite learning is developed to guarantee parameter convergence without the PE condition. In the composite learning, online recorded data together with instantaneous data are applied to generate prediction errors, and both tracking errors and prediction errors are utilized to update parametric estimates. The proposed approach is also extended to an output-feedback case by using a nonlinear separation principle. The distinctive feature of the composite learning is that parameter convergence can be guaranteed by an interval-excitation condition which is much weaker than the PE condition such that the control performance can be improved from practical asymptotic stability to practical exponential stability. An illustrative example is used for verifying effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2015.2495232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7553586/07308006.pdf","startPage":"2603","endPage":"2609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2015.2495232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7553586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite Learning From Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308006/","displayDocTitle":"Composite Learning From Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control","volume":"61","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16253305","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308006/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Defense Innovative Research Programme, MINDEF of Singapore","grantNumber":"MINDEF-NUSDIRP/2012/02"},{"fundingName":"Biomedical Engineering Programme, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore","grantNumber":"1421480015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Learning From Adaptive Dynamic Surface Control","sourcePdf":"tac-yu-2495232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078808S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7553586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"7553586","articleId":"7308006","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7308008,"authors":[{"name":"Tadilo Endeshaw Bogale","affiliation":["Institute National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7308008/bogal-2495191-small.gif","p":["Tadilo Endeshaw Bogale (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Jimma University, Jimma, Ethiopia, and the M.Sc. degree from Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden, and Ph.D. degree from the University Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain la neuve, Belgium, both in electrical engineering, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

For these systems, first, we design novel minimum-mean-squared error (MMSE) hybrid analog-digital channel estimator by considering both cases with perfect and imperfect channel covariance matrix knowledge. Then, we utilize the estimated channels to enable beamforming for data transmission. When the channel covariance matrices of all user equipments (UEs) are known perfectly, we show that there is a tradeoff between the training duration and throughput. Specifically, we exploit the fact that the optimal training duration that maximizes the throughput depends on the covariance matrices of all UEs, number of RF chains, and channel coherence time (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n). We also show that the training time optimization problem can be formulated as a concave maximization problem where its global optimal solution can be obtained efficiently using existing tools. The analytical expressions are validated by performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"63","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15677228","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7308008/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Analog-Digital Channel Estimation and Beamforming: Training-Throughput Tradeoff","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Analog-Digital Channel Estimation and Beamforming: Training-Throughput Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"tcomm-bogale-2495191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124416S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7308008","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7308010,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","National Mobile Communication Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7308010/lyang-2495278-small.gif","p":["Liang Yang was born in Hunan, China.

By applying the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol at the terrestrial relay, both the relay and the destination are corrupted by cochannel interference from the terrestrial network. Based on this setup, we first derive the approximate statistical distributions signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) and then analyze the system performance. To obtain more insights into the system performance, some asymptotical bit-error rate (BER) results are provided. Moreover, we extend our analysis to a multiple-relay network and analyze the asymptotic performance.

The key idea is that each BS cluster is formed by using the second-order Voronoi region, and the BS clusters are assigned to a specific cluster pattern by using edge-coloring for a graph drawn by Delaunay triangulation. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the BS selection conflict problem is prevented, while users are guaranteed to communicate with their two closest BSs in any irregular BS topology. With the proposed coordination method, analytical expressions for the rate distribution and the ergodic spectral efficiency are derived as a function of relevant system parameters in a fixed irregular network model. In a random network model with a homogeneous Poisson point process, a lower bound on the ergodic spectral efficiency is characterized. Through system level simulations, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of conventional coordination methods: dynamic clustering and static clustering. Our major finding is that, when users are dense enough in a network, the proposed method provides the same level of coordination benefit with dynamic clustering to edge users.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07308016.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2495355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2495355","startPage":"402","endPage":"415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Base Station Coloring for Pair-Wise Multi-Cell Coordination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308016/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Base Station Coloring for Pair-Wise Multi-Cell Coordination","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308016/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15704912","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Co.

Since FD nodes are inherently constrained by the loopback interference (LI), we study precoding schemes for the AP based on maximum ratio combining (MRC)/maximal ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing, and the optimal scheme for UL and DL sum rate maximization using tools from stochastic geometry. In order to shed insights into the systems performance, simple expressions for single antenna/perfect LI cancellation/negligible internode interference cases are also presented. We show that FD precoding at AP improves the UL/DL sum rate and hence a doubling of the performance of the HD mode is achievable. In particular, our results show that these impressive performance gains remain substantially intact even if the LI cancellation is imperfect. Furthermore, relative performance gap between FD and HD modes increases as the number of transmit/receive antennas becomes large, while with the MRC/MRT scheme, increasing the receive antenna number at FD AP, is more beneficial in terms of sum rate than increasing the transmit antenna number.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308017/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"63","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15677233","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7308017/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Full-Duplex Radio for Uplink/Downlink Wireless Access With Spatially Random Nodes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Communications"},{"fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus","grantNumber":"CY-IL/0114/02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Duplex Radio for Uplink/Downlink Wireless Access With Spatially Random Nodes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-mohammadi-2495353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110515S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7308017","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7308020,"authors":[{"name":"Linbo Long","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7471560/7308020/long-2495264-small.gif","p":["Linbo Long received the B.S. degree in computer science from the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include compiler optimization, emerging memory techniques, and embedded systems."]},"firstName":"Linbo","lastName":"Long","id":"37085338739"},{"name":"Duo Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7471560/7308020/liu-2495264-small.gif","p":["Duo Liu received the B.E. degree in computer science from the Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang, China, in 2003, the M.E. degree from the Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2012.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.

However, the limited amount of memory and virtualization's memory-demanding nature make it challenging to virtualize mobile systems efficiently. In this paper, we utilize morphable resistive memories to design a high-performance mobile system with an extensible memory space. With morphable resistive memories, a simple and effective page management technique, Balloonfish, is proposed to convert the memory cell state between multilevel and single-level for achieving a balance between performance and memory space. First, an application-specific page allocation is proposed for managing morphable resistive memories in virtualized mobile systems. Besides, we use a balloon-style algorithm to balance memory allocation among multiple virtual machines. Our evaluation based on the Samsung Exynos 5250 system-on-chip with various real Android applications shows that our system achieves 28.63% performance improvement compared with the baseline scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308020/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308020/","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2016","accessionNumber":"16002765","volume":"35","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Morphable Resistive Memory Optimization for Mobile Virtualization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61309004, 61173014, 61472052, 61272103 and 61373049"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of the Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130191120030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002865","fundingName":"Chongqing High-Tech Research Program","grantNumber":"cstc2013jcyjA40025 and 2014yykfB40007"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"CDJZR14185501 and 0214005207005"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Program","grantNumber":"2015AA015304"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"GRF 152138/14E and GRF 15222315/15E"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"4-ZZD7, G-YK24, GYM10 and G-YN36"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphable Resistive Memory Optimization for Mobile Virtualization","sourcePdf":"tcad-liu-2495264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100902S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7471560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7471560","articleId":"7308020","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7308022,"authors":[{"name":"Wentao Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7308022/wzhao-2495217-small.gif","p":["Wentao Zhao (S\u201913) received the M.S. degree from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2013.

In this paper, we study a resource sharing scheme for the D2D communication underlaying cellular networks, where multiple D2D pairs can share subchannels with multiple cellular users (CUs). Our optimization task is to maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs while satisfying the rate requirements of all CUs. The formulated problem falls naturally into a mixed integer programming form that is intractable. We first develop a subchannel sharing protocol, by which we can determine whether or not a subchannel can be reused by two D2D pairs. Then, we prove that the problem can be well approximated by ignoring the mutual interference among the D2D pairs that share the same subchannels without deteriorating the performance of both the CUs and the D2D pairs. Based on the analysis results, we propose an efficient subchannel allocation scheme by employing a simple greedy strategy, as well as a power distribution algorithm that can work out almost the optimal solution to the original problem. Numerical results show that our proposal can significantly increase spectrum efficiency of the cellular system. Furthermore, our proposed subchannel sharing protocol is effective and efficient for practical communication scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677238","htmlLink":"/document/7308022/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Sharing Scheme for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JiangsuSF","grantNumber":"BK20151389"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"021014380013"},{"fundingName":"open research fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"2016D08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Sharing Scheme for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2495217-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091524S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7308022","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7308023,"authors":[{"name":"Slim Zaidi","affiliation":["EMT Center, INRS, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7358193/7308023/zaidi-2495286-small.gif","p":["Slim Zaidi received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunications from the National Engineering School of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia, and the M.Sc. degree (with highest Hons.) from INRS, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In the first time slot, all sources send their signals to the network, whereas in the second time slot, the terminals multiply the received signal by their respective beamforming weights and forward the resulting signals to the receiver. We design these weights so as to minimize the interferences plus noises' powers while maintaining the received power from the source to a constant level. We show, however, that they are intractable in closed form due to the complexity of the polychromatic channels arising from the presence of scattering. By resorting to a two-ray channel approximation proved valid at relatively low angular spread (AS) values, we are able to derive the new optimum weights and prove that they could be locally computed at each terminal, thereby complying with the distributed feature of the network of interest. The so-obtained bichromatic distributed collaborative beamforming (B-DCB) is then analyzed and compared in performance to the monochromatic CB (MCB), whose design does not account for scattering, and the optimal CSI-based CB (OCB). Comparisons are made under both ideal and real-world conditions where we account for implementation errors and the overhead incurred by each CB solution. They reveal that the proposed B-DCB always outperforms MCB in practice; and that it approaches OCB in lightly to moderately scattered environments under ideal conditions and outperforms it under real-world conditions even in highly scattered environments. In such conditions, indeed, the B-DCB operational regions in terms of AS values over, which it is favored against OCB could reach until 50\u00b0 and hence cover about the entire span of AS values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","accessionNumber":"15677208","htmlLink":"/document/7308023/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Collaborative Beamforming Design for Maximized Throughput in Interfered and Scattered Environments","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CRD, DG"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"CREATE PERSWADE Programs of NSERC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Discovery Accelerator Supplement Award from NSERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Collaborative Beamforming Design for Maximized Throughput in Interfered and Scattered Environments","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zaidi-2495286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112387S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7358193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7358193","articleId":"7308023","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7308027,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas P.

Motivated by this consideration in this paper, a unified communication-theoretic framework for the analysis of the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity, the secrecy outage probability, and the secrecy capacity of multiple-antenna systems over fading channels is proposed. Specifically, a powerful frequency-domain approach is first developed in which the integrals involved in the evaluation of the probability of nonzero secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability are transformed into the frequency domain, by employing Parseval's theorem. A generic approach for the evaluation of the asymptotic secrecy outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region is also introduced, thus providing useful insight as to the parameters affecting the secrecy performance. Finally, a unified numerical approach for computing the average secrecy capacity of multiple-antenna systems under arbitrary fading environments is developed. The proposed framework is general enough to accommodate any well-known multiantenna transmission technique and fading model. Finally, the secrecy performance of several multiple-antenna system setups is assessed, in the presence of generalized fading conditions and arbitrary antenna correlation, while various numerical and computer simulation results are shown and compared to substantiate the proposed mathematical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2495293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7383348/07308027.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7383348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2495293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Security for Multiple-Antenna Systems: A Unified Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Security for Multiple-Antenna Systems: A Unified Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308027/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15704906","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308027/","volume":"64","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Security for Multiple-Antenna Systems: A Unified Approach","sourcePdf":"tcomm-peppas-2495293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13518S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7383348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7383348","articleId":"7308027","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7308038,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengmin Kong","affiliation":["Automation Department, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7365556/7308038/kong-2493888-small.gif","p":["Zhengmin Kong received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electronic Information and Communications, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003 and 2011, respectively.

Explicitly, we jointly design the TPC and receive filter matrices based on the minimum total mean-squared error (MSE) criterion under a given and feasible information-theoretic degrees of freedom. More specifically, we formulate this problem by minimizing the total MSEs of the signals communicated between the legitimate transmitter-receiver pairs, while ensuring that the MSE of the signals decoded by the eavesdropper remains higher than a certain threshold. We demonstrate that the joint design of the TPC and receive filter matrices subject to both secrecy and transmit power constraints can be accomplished by an efficient iterative distributed algorithm. The convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm is characterized as well. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm, including both its secrecy rate and MSE, is characterized with the aid of numerical results. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional interference alignment algorithm in terms of both the achievable secrecy rate and the MSE. As a benefit, secure communications can be guaranteed by the proposed algorithm for the MIMO interference channel even in the presence of a sophisticated/strong eavesdropper, whose number of antennas is much higher than that of each legitimate transmitter and receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Distributed Minimum Total MSE Approach for Secure Communications in MIMO Interference Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493888","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7365556/07308038.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2493888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7365556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Distributed Minimum Total MSE Approach for Secure Communications in MIMO Interference Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7308038/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15716128","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201168"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Distributed Minimum Total MSE Approach for Secure Communications in MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tifs-hanzo-2493888-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115258S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7365556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7365556","articleId":"7308038","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7308044,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Busquets-Monge","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7401175/7308044/busqu-2495295-small.gif","p":["\n\nSergio Busquets-Monge (SM'11) was born in Barcelona, Spain.

This method performs very well in a variety of applications, but results in a representation that is multi-valued and not optimized with respect to the entire image. An alternative representation structure is provided by a convolutional sparse representation, in which a sparse representation of an entire image is computed by replacing the linear combination of a set of dictionary vectors by the sum of a set of convolutions with dictionary filters. The resulting representation is both single-valued and jointly optimized over the entire image. While this form of a sparse representation has been applied to a variety of problems in signal and image processing and computer vision, the computational expense of the corresponding optimization problems has restricted application to relatively small signals and images. This paper presents new, efficient algorithms that substantially improve on the performance of other recent methods, contributing to the development of this type of representation as a practical tool for a wider range of problems.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2495260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7331739/07308045.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2495260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for Convolutional Sparse Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308045/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Algorithms for Convolutional Sparse Representations","volume":"25","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15645947","pubMedId":"26529765","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308045/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy through the LANL/LDRD Program"},{"fundingName":"UC Lab Fees Research","grantNumber":"12-LR-236660"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Algorithms for Convolutional Sparse Representations","sourcePdf":"tip-wohlberg-2495260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126303S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7331739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"7331739","articleId":"7308045","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7308049,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Each user wants to exchange messages with all the other users through the relay. A transmission strategy is proposed for this channel. The proposed strategy is based on two steps: 1) channel diagonalization and 2) cyclic communication. The channel diagonalization is applied by using zero-forcing beam-forming. After the channel diagonalization, the channel is decomposed into parallel sub-channels. Cyclic communication is then applied, where signal-space alignment for network-coding is used over each sub-channel.

This paper presents a new gradient-domain approach, called depth analogy, that makes use of analogy as a means for synthesizing a target depth field, when a collection of RGB-D image pairs is given as training data. Specifically, the proposed method employs a non-parametric learning process that creates an analogous depth field by sampling reliable depth gradients using visual correspondence established on training image pairs. Unlike existing data-driven approaches that directly select depth values from training data, our framework transfers depth gradients as reconstruction cues, which are then integrated by the Poisson reconstruction. The performance of most conventional approaches relies heavily on the training RGB-D data used in the process, and such a dependency severely degenerates the quality of reconstructed depth maps when the desired depth distribution of an input image is quite different from that of the training data, e.g., outdoor versus indoor scenes. Our key observation is that using depth gradients in the reconstruction is less sensitive to scene characteristics, providing better cues for depth recovery. Thus, our gradient-domain approach can support a great variety of training range datasets that involve substantial appearance and geometric variations. The experimental results demonstrate that our (depth) gradient-domain approach outperforms existing data-driven approaches directly working on depth domain, even when only uncorrelated training datasets are available.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2495261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2495261","startPage":"5953","endPage":"5966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07308054.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth Analogy: Data-Driven Approach for Single Image Depth Estimation Using Gradient Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Depth Analogy: Data-Driven Approach for Single Image Depth Estimation Using Gradient Samples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308054/","accessionNumber":"15565761","pubMedId":"26529766","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308054/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea within Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning through the Korean Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A2A2A01068338"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council, VideoWorld"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth Analogy: Data-Driven Approach for Single Image Depth Estimation Using Gradient Samples","sourcePdf":"tip-sohn-2495261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162674S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7308054","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7308057,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Tebaldini","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7419294/7308057/tebal-2488358-small.gif","p":["\n\nStefano Tebaldini received the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","Since 2005, he has been with the Digital Signal Processing Research Group, Politecnico di Milano, where he has been a Permanent Researcher since 2011.

A fundamental requirement for TomoSAR processing is to have precise knowledge of the platform position along the 2-D synthetic aperture. This requirement is not easily met in the case where the 2-D aperture is formed by collecting different flight lines (i.e., 1-D apertures) in a repeat-pass fashion, which is the typical case of airborne and spaceborne TomoSAR. Subwavelength platform position errors give rise to residual phase screens among different passes, which hinder coherent focusing in the 3-D space. In this paper, we propose a strategy for calibrating repeat-pass tomographic SAR data that allows us to accurately estimate and remove such residual phase screens in the absence of reference targets and prior information about terrain topography and even in the absence of any point- or surface-like target within the illuminated scene. The problem is tackled by observing that multiple flight lines provide enough information to jointly estimate platform and target positions, up to a roto-translation of the coordinate system used for representing the imaged scene. The employment of volumetric scatterers in the calibration process is enabled by the phase linking algorithm, which allows us to represent them as equivalent phase centers. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations, in order to validate the results based on the exact knowledge of the simulated scatterers, and using real data from the ESA campaigns AlpTomoSAR, BioSAR 2008, and TropiSAR. A cross-check of the results from simultaneous P- and L-band acquisitions from the TropiSAR data set indicates that the dispersion of the retrieved flight trajectories is limited to a few millimeters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7419294/07308057.pdf","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1792","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2488358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Calibration of Airborne Tomographic SAR Data via Phase Center Double Localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Phase Calibration of Airborne Tomographic SAR Data via Phase Center Double Localization","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7308057/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823038","dateOfInsertion":"29 February 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Calibration of Airborne Tomographic SAR Data via Phase Center Double Localization","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tebaldini-2488358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184708S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7419294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7419294","articleId":"7308057","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":7308063,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Hinkkanen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7435355/7308063/hinkk-2495288-small.gif","p":["\n\nMarko Hinkkanen (M'06\u2013SM'13) received the M.Sc.(Eng.) and \nD.Sc.(Tech.) degrees from Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with Aalto the School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo.

The dynamic performance of current controllers based on the continuous-time motor model is limited, particularly if the ratio of the sampling frequency to the fundamental frequency is low. An exact closed-form hold-equivalent discrete motor model is derived. The zero-order hold of the stator-voltage input is modeled in stationary coordinates, where it physically is. An analytical discrete-time pole-placement design method for two-degrees-of-freedom proportional-integral current control is proposed. The proposed method is easy to apply: only the desired closed-loop bandwidth and the three motor parameters (Rs, Ld, Lq) are required. The robustness of the proposed current control design against parameter errors is analyzed. The controller is experimentally verified using a 6.7-kW SyRM drive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2016","publicationDate":"March-April 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308063/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15869929","volume":"52","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current Control for Synchronous Motor Drives: Direct Discrete-Time Pole-Placement Design","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ABB Oy"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Current Control for Synchronous Motor Drives: Direct Discrete-Time Pole-Placement Design","sourcePdf":"tia-hinkkanen-2495288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138407S","chronDate":"March-April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7435355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7435355","articleId":"7308063","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7308064,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This paper proposes a simple method to obtain pulsewidth modulation (PWM) timings for a dodecagonal voltage SV structure using only sampled reference voltages. In addition to this, a carrier-based method for obtaining the PWM timings for a general N-level dodecagonal structure is proposed in this paper for the first time. The algorithm outputs the triangle information and the PWM timing values which can be set as the compare values for any carrier-based hardware PWM module to obtain SV PWM like switching sequences. The proposed method eliminates the need for angle estimation, computation of modulation indices, and iterative search algorithms that are typical in multilevel dodecagonal SV systems. The proposed PWM scheme was implemented on a five-level dodecagonal SV structure. Exhaustive simulation and experimental results for steady-state and transient conditions are presented to validate the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2495283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2495283","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1403","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7401175/07308064.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Calculations for a General N-Level Dodecagonal Space Vector Structure Using Only Reference Phase Voltages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Timing Calculations for a General N-Level Dodecagonal Space Vector Structure Using Only Reference Phase Voltages","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","volume":"63","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308064/","accessionNumber":"15775305","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308064/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Calculations for a General N-Level Dodecagonal Space Vector Structure Using Only Reference Phase Voltages","sourcePdf":"tie-gopakumar-2495283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090318S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7401175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7401175","articleId":"7308064","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7308070,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Woo Ryu","affiliation":["Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., Hwaseong, Korea","College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jang-Woo","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37085725114"},{"name":"Kee-Won Kwon","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kee-Won","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37067922800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7308070","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":864},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308070","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Sensors","Nonvolatile memory","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Monte Carlo methods","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable 2T2MTJ nonvolatile static gain cell STT-MRAM","self-referencing sensing circuits","embedded memory application","magneto-tunneling junctions","cache memory application","wide distribution","threshold voltage","gain cells","enhanced sensing margin","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emerging memories","STT-MRAM","spin torque transfer (STT)","Sense-amplifier","Self-referencing"]},{"kwd":["Emerging memories","self-referencing","sense amplifier","spin-torque transfer (STT)","STT-magnetic RAM (MRAM)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a reliable nonvolatile static gain cell made of two transistors and two magneto-tunneling junctions (MTJs) for cache memory application.

Most of the existing SCA approaches for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) adopt optimization-based methods and rely on the prior knowledge of the secondary user (SU) activities. To relax this constraint, learning-based methods have been recently developed; however, there is still insufficient theoretical understanding within the learning framework for SCA. In this paper, we aim to maximize the total amount of the captured SU traffic, and we formulate the SCA problem as a nonstochastic/adversarial multiarmed bandit problem. Moreover, the inherent error in wireless capturing, i.e., imperfect monitoring, is considered in our model. We propose two online learning algorithms for the SCA scenarios with and without channel switching costs, respectively, and their regret performances are proved uniformly sublinear in time and polynomial in the number of channels. The numerical evaluation shows, in addition to their robust regret performances, the proposed algorithms greatly outperform the existing SCA approaches in the amount of effectively captured SU traffic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","volume":"15","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"15837534","publicationDate":"March 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308072/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sniffer Channel Assignment With Imperfect Monitoring for Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301127 and 61371080"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Chinese Central Universities","grantNumber":"HUST: 2015QN085 and HUST:2015QN076"},{"fundingName":"US NSF","grantNumber":"CIF-0910765 and CNS-1217689"},{"fundingName":"US NSF CAREER","grantNumber":"CNS-1502584"},{"fundingName":"US NSF EARS","grantNumber":"CNS-1464487"},{"fundingName":"IEEE MILCOM"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sniffer Channel Assignment With Imperfect Monitoring for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2495259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085699S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7428982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7428982","articleId":"7308072","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7308074,"authors":[{"name":"Francis Mwasilu","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7423826/7308074/mwasi-small.gif","p":["Francis Mwasilu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering\n from the University of Dar es salaam, Dar es salaam, Tanzania, in 2008.

For a safe and continuous operation of the modern EV, the drive has to acquire robustness features for position sensor failures. Hence, the proposed FTC is based on an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), which continuously estimates both the states and covariance matrices that describe the statistic characters of the system. Under a position sensor failure, the proposed FTC scheme instantly detects sensor fault and reconfigures the traction system with a virtual sensor to provide an EV with a necessary limp home capability. Unlike the conventional EKF with fixed covariance matrices, the proposed AEKF exhibits the robustness to the system stochastic noises and the transient operating conditions. Simulation on MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results on the IPMSM test bed with a TMS320F28335 DSP under various transient operating conditions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed FTC scheme in comparison to the FTC with the conventional EKF. The comparative results indicate that the proposed AEKF more precisely estimates the rotor position with features robust to the position sensor failures than the conventional EKF.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2495240","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7423826/07308074.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2495240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7423826","startPage":"5746","endPage":"5758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Fault-Tolerant Control of Interior PMSMs Based on an Adaptive EKF for EV Traction Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Fault-Tolerant Control of Interior PMSMs Based on an Adaptive EKF for EV Traction Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"15823195","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7308074/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A2A01003513"},{"fundingName":"Korea government"},{"fundingName":"MSIP"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"ICT and Future Planning"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Fault-Tolerant Control of Interior PMSMs Based on an Adaptive EKF for EV Traction Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-jung-2495240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081227S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7423826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7423826","articleId":"7308074","onlineDate":"27 October 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7308434,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas C.

The time-varying availability of energy at the sender limits the rate of update packet transmissions. At any time, the age of information is defined as the amount of time since the most recent update was successfully received. An offline solution that minimizes not only the time average age, but also the peak age for an arbitrary energy replenishment profile is derived. The related decision problem under stochastic energy arrivals at the sender is studied through a discrete time dynamic programming formulation, and the structure of the optimal policy that minimizes the expected age is shown. It is found that tracking the expected value of the current age (which is a linear operation), together with the knowledge of the current energy level at the sender side is sufficient for generating an optimal threshold policy. An effective online heuristic, Balance Updating (BU), that achieves performance close to an omniscient (offline) policy is proposed. Simulations of the policies indicate that they can significantly improve the age over greedy approaches. An extension of the formulation to stochastically formed updates is considered.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308962","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308962.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age of information under energy replenishment constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Age of information under energy replenishment constraints","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308962/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568699","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308962/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age of information under energy replenishment constraints","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"04AgeofInformationunderEnergyReplenishmen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059317S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7308963,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Rioul","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Rioul","id":"37078832100"},{"name":"Max H.

It is shown that, from a graph-theoretic point of view, an algebraic LDPC code whose parity-check matrix is an array of submatrices of the same size over a finite field is a protograph LDPC code. Conversely, from a matrix-theoretic point of view, since the parity-check matrix of a protograph code can be arranged as an array of submatrices of the same size over a finite field and its base graph (or base matrix) can be constructed algebraically, a protograph LDPC code is an algebraic LDPC code. These two major approaches have their advantages and disadvantages in code construction. Unification of these two approaches may lead to better designs and constructions of LDPC codes to achieve good overall performance in terms of error performance in waterfall region, error-floor location and rate of decoding convergence. This paper is the first part of a series of two parts, Part-I and Part-II. Part-I investigates only the binary LDPC codes constructed by the superposition and the protograph-based methods. Part-II explores nonbinary LDPC codes from both superposition and protograph points of view. Also included in Part II are specific superposition constructions of both binary and nonbinary quasi-cyclic LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308964","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308964.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unnoticed strong connection between algebraic-based and protograph-based LDPC codes, Part I: Binary case and interpretation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"An unnoticed strong connection between algebraic-based and protograph-based LDPC codes, Part I: Binary case and interpretation","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308964/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15558231","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308964/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unnoticed strong connection between algebraic-based and protograph-based LDPC codes, Part I: Binary case and interpretation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"06AnUnnoticedStrongConnectionBetweenAlgeb.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169083S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7308965,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Dupraz","affiliation":["ETIS - ENSEA / Univ.

Compared to [1], [2] which analyze only the faulty one-step majority logic decoder, we analyze here the reliability of the whole memory construction. We introduce a sequence of output errors probabilities at successive time instants and determine the properties and the fixed points of the sequence.

We finally represent the reliability regions of the Taylor-Kuznetsov memory with respect to the decoder noise parameters and validate the theoretical results with Monte-Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Taylor-Kuznetsov memory using one-step majority logic decoder","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308965","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308965.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Taylor-Kuznetsov memory using one-step majority logic decoder","conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308965/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15558225","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Taylor-Kuznetsov memory using one-step majority logic decoder","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"07AnalysisofTaylorKuznetsovMemoryusingOne.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053802S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7308969,"authors":[{"name":"Avik Sengupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hume Center for National Security and Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Avik","lastName":"Sengupta","id":"38236125500"},{"name":"Ravi Tandon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Discovery Analytics Center, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Tandon","id":"38556954900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7195-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7308969","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308969","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical network units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","mobile communication","mobile computing","multicast communication","multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cut-set bounds","device-to-device communication","D2D communication","self-sustaining D2D network","content-centric wireless networks","backhaul-free communication","interdevice multicast transmissions","D2D multicast rate","device storage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308969","endPage":"83","startPage":"78","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond cut-set bounds - the approximate capacity of D2D networks","abstract":"Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is emerging as a viable solution for alleviating the severe capacity crunch in content-centric wireless networks.

In traditional MIMO systems, precoding/combining is usually done digitally at baseband with one radio frequency (RF) chain and one analog-to-digital converter (ADC) per antenna. The high cost and power consumption of RF chains and ADCs at mmWave frequencies make an all-digital processing approach prohibitive. When only a limited number of RF chains is available, hybrid architectures that split the precoding/combining processing into the analog and digital domains are attractive. A previously proposed hybrid solution employs phase shifters and mixers in the RF precoding/combining stage. It obtains near optimal spectral efficiencies with a reduced number of RF channels. In this paper we propose a different hybrid architecture, which simplifies the hardware at the receiver by replacing the phase shifters with switches. We present a new approach for compressed sensing based channel estimation for the hybrid architectures. Given the channel estimate, we propose a novel algorithm that jointly designs the antenna subsets selected and the baseband combining. Using power consumption calculations and achievable rates, we compare the performance of hybrid combining with antenna switching and phase shifting, showing that antenna selection is preferred in a range of operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308971","startPage":"90","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308971.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation and hybrid combining for mmWave: Phase shifters or switches?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308971/","conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation and hybrid combining for mmWave: Phase shifters or switches?","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15558215","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7308971/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation and hybrid combining for mmWave: Phase shifters or switches?","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"13Channelestimationandhybridcombiningform.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082914S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7308972,"authors":[{"name":"Jinbei Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Jinbei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37859994600"},{"name":"Xiaojun Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37274731700"},{"name":"Xinbing Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China"],"firstName":"Xinbing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7195-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7308972","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":540},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Additives","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","multicast communication","multimedia communication","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded caching","arbitrary popularity distributions","backbone traffic","high-volume multimedia content","coded multicast opportunities","deterministic worst-case analysis","heterogeneous file popularity","information-theoretical lower bound"]}],"abstract":"Caching plays an important role in reducing the backbone traffic when serving high-volume multimedia content. Recently, a new class of coded caching schemes have received significant interest because they can exploit coded multi-cast opportunities to further reduce backbone traffic. Without considering file popularity, prior works have characterized the fundamental performance limits of coded caching through a deterministic worst-case analysis. However, when heterogeneous file popularity is taken into account, there remain open questions regarding the fundamental limits of coded caching performance. In this work, for an arbitrary popularity distribution, we first derive a new information-theoretical lower bound on the expected transmission rate of any coded caching schemes. We then show that a simple coded-caching scheme attains an expected transmission rate that is at most a constant factor away from the lower bound (except a small additive term). Unlike other existing studies, the constant factor that we derived is independent of the popularity distribution.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308972","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308972.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded caching under arbitrary popularity distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coded caching under arbitrary popularity distributions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308972/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15558239","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308972/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded caching under arbitrary popularity distributions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"14CodedCachingunderArbitraryPopularityDis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094899S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7308974,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Won Choi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Hanyang University"],"firstName":"Jun Won","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405961800"},{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37277951300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7195-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7308974","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Q measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","MIMO communication","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive multi-input multi-output technique","massive MIMO technique","transmit antennas","base-station","channel state information","downlink pilot signals","downlink pilot allocation strategy","compressed sensing principle","channel impulse response","CIR","OFDM symbol rate","Oracle-based Kalman smoother"]}],"abstract":"Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique deploys a number of transmit antennas in base-station (BS) to support large number of users and high data throughput.

Iterative decoding can be viewed as a recursive procedure for Bethe free energy function minimization, and the randomness in a message update may help the decoder to escape from local minima. The decoder operates in a stochastic fashion, but the random perturbations do not require any additional hardware as they are built-in the faulty hardware itself.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15558226","htmlLink":"/document/7308978/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault-resilient decoders and memories made of unreliable components","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-resilient decoders and memories made of unreliable components","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"20FaultResilientDecodersandMemoriesmadeof.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088444S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7308979,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Han Nam","affiliation":["Samsung Research America, Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Young-Han","lastName":"Nam","id":"37394869700"},{"name":"Md Saifur Rahman","affiliation":["Samsung Research America, Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Md Saifur","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085352123"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Samsung Research America, Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085523934"},{"name":"Gang Xu","affiliation":["Samsung Research America, Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085632530"},{"name":"Eko Onggosanusi","affiliation":["Samsung Research America, Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Eko","lastName":"Onggosanusi","id":"37329512300"},{"name":"Jianzhong Zhang","affiliation":["Samsung Research America, Dallas Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jianzhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407616500"},{"name":"Ji-Yun Seol","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Yun","lastName":"Seol","id":"37085459631"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7195-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7308979","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1603},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7308979","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Antenna arrays","Arrays","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","array signal processing","cellular radio","channel capacity","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G","elevation beamforming","full dimension MIMO","FD-MIMO","3GPP LTE-Advanced","base station","2-dimensional active array","3D beamfoming","cell capacity","antenna","radio frequency transceiver","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"Elevation beamforming and Full Dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) has been an active area of research and standardization in 3GPP LTE-Advanced. In an FD-MIMO system, a base station with 2-dimensional (2D) active array supports multi-user joint elevation and azimuth beamforming (a.k.a. 3D beamfoming), which results in much higher cell capacity compared to conventional systems. Recent study has shown that with these new FD-MIMO technologies, we can achieve promising 3-5\u00d7 gain in both cell capacity as well as cell-edge throughput. In this paper, we will provide a brief summary of recent 3GPP activities, including the recently completed 3D channel model, ongoing study on FD-MIMO scenarios, antenna/RF (radio frequency) transceiver architectures, as well as potential network performance benefits. In addition, we also discuss some methods for reducing CSI (channel state information) feedback overhead and ensuring efficient operation of large size FD-MIMO for both TDD and FDD systems.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7308979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7308979","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07308979.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full dimension MIMO for LTE-Advanced and 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7308979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Full dimension MIMO for LTE-Advanced and 5G","conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15558245","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7308979/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full dimension MIMO for LTE-Advanced and 5G","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"21FullDimensionMIMOforLTEAdvancedand5G.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061004S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7308979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7308984,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Venugopal","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Venugopal"},{"name":"Matthew C.

Previous work that models interference in wireless networks has leveraged stochastic geometry and often assumes an infinite number of interferers. In the indoor wearables setting, a finite network may be a more realistic assumption. This paper analyzes mmWave networks with a finite number of interferers that are located in fixed positions. The paper considers the effect of blockages, which are primarily caused by the human bodies present in the operating environment.

SC-LDPC codes can provide scalable code-length, high granularity, convolutional-gain, low-complexity decoding, and high parallel processing. To overcome the limitations of the current SC-LDPC decoders which have essentially hindered the widespread adoption of SC-LDPC, we propose a new decoder which we call the Zigzag Decoder, that essentially leverages the convolutional-gain of the sliding window decoder. We show that the zigzag-window decoder reduces the average number of iterations and improves the performance relative to the conventional sliding-window decoder. Furthermore, for facilitating the use of SC-LDPC codes in practice, we have explored how to generate SC-LDPC code families and compare the performance and complexity between shortening-based and puncturing-based SC-LDPC code families supporting different code rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07309001.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"281","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7309001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7309001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially-coupled low-density parity check codes: Zigzag-window decoding and code-family design considerations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Bit error rate","Convolutional codes","Zirconium","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially-coupled low-density parity check codes","zigzag-window decoding","code-family design considerations","SC-LDPC codes","convolutional-turbo codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","spatially-coupled","iterative decoder","sliding window","zigzag window","shortening","puncturing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spatially-coupled low-density parity check codes: Zigzag-window decoding and code-family design considerations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"15558232","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially-coupled low-density parity check codes: Zigzag-window decoding and code-family design considerations","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"43Spatiallycoupledlowdensityparitycheckco.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053141S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7309001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309002,"authors":[{"name":"Henry D.

Recently, a number of generalized product codes have been proposed for forward error-correction in high-speed optical communication. In practice, these codes are decoded by iteratively decoding each of the component codes. Symmetric product codes are a subclass of generalized product codes that use symmetry to reduce the block length of a product code while using the same component code. One example of this subclass, dubbed half-product codes, was introduced by Tanner in 1981 and then generalized by Justesen in 2011. In this paper, we discuss some initial results on symmetric product codes. Our results show that: (i) these codes have a larger normalized minimum distance than the product code from which they are derived, (ii) some small constructions achieve the largest minimum distance possible for a linear code, and (iii) they can have better performance in both the waterfall region and the error floor when compared to a product code of similar length and rate.","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2015.7309002","publicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Information Theory and Applications Workshop (ITA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7152136/7308952/07309002.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2015.7309002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric product codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric product codes","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309002/","accessionNumber":"15558242","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric product codes","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"44SymmetricProductCodes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06607S","chronDate":"1-6 Feb. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7152136","isNumber":"7308952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7152136","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7308952","articleId":"7309002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7309075,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405133200"},{"name":"Qiongxuan Ge","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiongxuan","lastName":"Ge","id":"37278902600"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406354500"},{"name":"Xiaoxin Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Electric Drive, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281389200"},{"name":"Yang Yu","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085541823"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1522-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1523-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7309075","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel PWM strategy for three-level active neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter, this strategy can balance the power losses of all semiconductors and eliminate the fluctuation in the neutral point voltage over full range of converter output voltage and for all load power factors of ANPC converter.

building large HVDC networks. The world first Zhoushan five-terminal HVDC project constructed in China has been put into operation. To increase the operation reliability, a HVDC circuit breaker will be required. However the existing HVDC breaker developed in recent years still can't deal with severe fault current of a high rise of rate in this project. Considering the availability in a real HVDC network, this paper proposed a new full-bridge based hybrid HVDC breaker. The hybrid HVDC breaker has significant technical advantage compared with other options especially in terms of current breaking ability, and the compact modular integration of the prototype greatly reduce the demand of the space. Safely test procedures is developed to verify the performance of the hybrid HVDC breaker.

SiC devices have been shown to have superior electro-thermal ruggedness during unclamped inductive switching (UIS) compared with similarly rated silicon IGBTs [1]. Failure during UIS normally results from parasitic BJT latch-up which is exacerbated at higher temperatures [2, 3]. Measurements show that the total avalanche energy conducted by the device improves when the UIS occurs over longer avalanche duration with a smaller peak avalanche current as opposed to a higher peak avalanche current over a shorter duration. This is due to the fact that cell-to-cell (or die-to-die) variations in electrical parameters are more critical during peak avalanche current conduction. Power MOSFETs are comprised to numerous FET cells internally connected to common source, drain and gate terminals and the density of which is determined by the cell pitch and die area. These FET cells are normally assumed to be uniform in electro-thermal properties, however, there are variations in parameters like thermal resistance, gate resistance, oxide thickness, body doping, etc. Finite element models of 2 FET cells within a MOSFET show how variations in gate resistance and thermal resistance (initial junction temperature) degrade the devices reliability under UIS and that this is more critical for higher avalanche currents. The finite element models are supported by experimental measurements designed to emulate the effect of inter-cell variation.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309180","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309180.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element modelling and experimental characterisation of paralleled SiC MOSFET failure under avalanche mode conduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Finite element modelling and experimental characterisation of paralleled SiC MOSFET failure under avalanche mode conduction","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309180/","accessionNumber":"15569172","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309180/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element modelling and experimental characterisation of paralleled SiC MOSFET failure under avalanche mode conduction","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0194epe2015full23501255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05274S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7309180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7309182,"authors":[{"name":"Shady S.

The variation of stator resistance, due to stator winding turn fault, creates an error in the estimated stator flux position that may subsequently cause a failure of the complete drive system. This paper proposes the possibility of developing a remedial operating strategy using artificial neural network (ANN), which ensures a fault tolerance of inter-turn stator winding fault in the direct torque control (DTC) for induction motor drives. The proposed fault tolerant approach is achieved using a strategy that detects inter-turn stator winding fault, identifies fault severity and improves the DTC performance in the presence of incipient stator winding turn fault. The fault tolerant system is obtained by tuning the stator resistance to make the DTC strategy more robust and precise. This allows continuous disturbance-free operation of the induction motor drives even with existing inter-turn stator winding faults. This strategy is simple to implement, does not require new sensors or changes in the standard drive system. Experimental implementation is demonstrated for the validity of the proposed idea.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANN-based system for inter-turn stator winding fault tolerant DTC for induction motor drives","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309182","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309182.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"ANN-based system for inter-turn stator winding fault tolerant DTC for induction motor drives","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309182/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15568927","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN-based system for inter-turn stator winding fault tolerant DTC for induction motor drives","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0197epe2015full17445213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053704S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7309182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309193,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Simulation and experimental results have validated the topology, modulation and control strategy for the four-level \u03c0-type converter.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309210","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309210.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A four-level \u03c0-type converter for low-voltage applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"A four-level \u03c0-type converter for low-voltage applications","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309210/","accessionNumber":"15569210","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309210/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A four-level \u03c0-type converter for low-voltage applications","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0237epe2015full11161618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074148S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7309210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7309243,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Song","affiliation":["FREEDM Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Song","id":"37085435897"},{"name":"Alex Q.

However, the large switching losses of the Si IGBT limit its switching frequency to only 100Hz to 1kHz. On the other hand, wide bandgap (WBG)power devices such as Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET or JFET have demonstrated their superior advantages over Si IGBT, especially in terms of significantly reduced switching losses. A major issue facing large scale adoption of SiC power devices is still the much higher cost. This paper proposes that the FREEDM-Pair, a Si/SiC hybrid switch, should be an ideal and cost effective switch for high power applications. In the proposed FREEDM-Pair, a SiC MOSFET is connected in parallel with Si IGBT to combine the advantages of IGBT and MOSFET. A 6.5kV FREEDM-Pair is developed as an example to demonstrate its superior cost/performance. Experimental results demonstrated 70% switching loss reduction and the FREEDM-Pair cost is estimated to be only 50% higher than 6.5kV Si IGBT.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309243","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309243.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"6.5kV FREEDM-Pair: Ideal high power switch capitalizing on Si and SiC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309243/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"6.5kV FREEDM-Pair: Ideal high power switch capitalizing on Si and SiC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309243/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15568853","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"6.5kV FREEDM-Pair: Ideal high power switch capitalizing on Si and SiC","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0299epe2015full01103294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062108S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7309243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7309244,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["OPAL-RT TECHNOLOGIES, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37633334900"},{"name":"Jean Belanger","affiliation":["OPAL-RT TECHNOLOGIES, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Belanger","id":"37274557800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1522-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1523-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7309244","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Valves","Automatic voltage control","Capacitors","Real-time systems","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power convertors","static VAr compensators","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel converter STATCOM","MMC STATCOM","submodules","capacitor voltages","protection system","hardware-in-the-loop tests","HIL tests","real time test bench","field programmable gate array boards","FPGA boards","high speed protocols","MMC manufacturers","high voltage direct current systems","HVDC systems","central processing unit cores","CPU cores","MMC controller","time 250 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FACTS","Field programmable gate array (FPGA)","Multilevel converters","Real time simulation","Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM)"]}],"abstract":"The modular multilevel converter (MMC) STATCOM removes the need for AC filter and transformer, has no DC bus fault hazard, and thus becomes a better option than a 2-level voltage source converter (VSC) STATCOM. An MMC can have hundreds of submodules (SM). The switches in the SM are controlled individually and the capacitor voltages have to be balanced. Therefore, the control and protection system is sophisticated and has to be validated for different scenarios preferably by hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) tests. Modeling MMC in detail and simulating it in real time has two main challenges: solving the large circuit containing numerous switches and handling numerous inputs and outputs (IO) in very small time steps. This paper presents a real time test bench, which implements the detailed MMC valve models in field programmable gate array (FPGA) boards and enables connecting to external controllers through high speed protocols used by MMC manufacturers. It can simulate very large systems, e.g. multiple MMC STATCOM and high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems with up to 1000 SM per valve, at multiple sampling rates in real time: the MMC valve is simulated in FPGA with a time step of 250 ns and the rest of the power system is simulated in central processing unit (CPU) cores with a time step of tens of microseconds. The detailed MMC model in the test bench is able to accurately reproduce system behaviors in steady state, transients and faults, which facilitate HIL tests of actual MMC controller for all scenarios in a close-to-reality environment.","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309244","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309244.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based real-time HIL test bench for full-bridge modular multilevel STATCOM controller","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-based real-time HIL test bench for full-bridge modular multilevel STATCOM controller","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309244/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569148","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-based real-time HIL test bench for full-bridge modular multilevel STATCOM controller","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0300epe2015full20392539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064836S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7309244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309270,"authors":[{"name":"Ataollah Mokhberdoran","affiliation":["EFACEC Energia M\u00e1quinas e Equipamentos El\u00e9ctricos, Porto, S.A, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ataollah","lastName":"Mokhberdoran","id":"37085749880"},{"name":"Adriano Carvalho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Adriano","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"37284756000"},{"name":"Nuno Silva","affiliation":["EFACEC Energia M\u00e1quinas e Equipamentos El\u00e9ctricos, Porto, S.A, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Silva","id":"37354396500"},{"name":"Helder Leite","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Helder","lastName":"Leite","id":"37394221800"},{"name":"Antonio Carrapatoso","affiliation":["EFACEC Energia M\u00e1quinas e Equipamentos El\u00e9ctricos, Porto, S.A, Portugal"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Carrapatoso","id":"37373872600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1522-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1523-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7309270","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new topology of fast solid-state HVDC circuit breaker for offshore wind integration applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309270.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309270","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit breakers","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","HVDC transmission","Interrupters","Topology","Fault currents","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","HVDC power transmission","offshore installations","overvoltage","short-circuit currents","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid-state HVDC circuit breaker","offshore wind integration application","voltage source converter","short-circuit fault current interruption","DC fault current","switching overvoltage","precharged capacitor","soft switching","high voltage direct current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC circuit-breaker","HVDC","Protection Device","Voltage Source Converter (VSC)","Short-circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309270","abstract":"Emerging new voltage source converter based HVDC applications demand fast short-circuit fault current interruption.

The proposed damping scheme employs modal filters to identify SSR upon occurrence and then injects currents at subsynchronous frequency to damp it. The SSR damper has been tested in the well-known IEEE First Benchmark Model, which has been upgraded with a VSC-HVDC link to form an integrated AC/DC system. Simulations have been performed in PSCAD, with eigenvalue analysis carried out in MATLAB for the small-signal stability assessment of the AC/DC system. Results show that the proposed scheme effectively damps SSR irrespectively of the torsional mode being excited.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309345","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309345.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active filtering based current injection method for multi modal SSR damping in an AC/DC system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Active filtering based current injection method for multi modal SSR damping in an AC/DC system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309345/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569275","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309345/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active filtering based current injection method for multi modal SSR damping in an AC/DC system","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0457epe2015full20104172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095208S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7295686","isNumber":"7309048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7295686","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7309048","articleId":"7309345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EPE Association and IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7309389,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Ghorbani","affiliation":["Universitat Politechnica de Catalunia (UPC), Spain"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Ghorbani","id":"37085343601"},{"name":"Davoud Esmail Moghadam","affiliation":["Universitat Politechnica de Catalunia (UPC), Spain"],"firstName":"Davoud Esmail","lastName":"Moghadam","id":"37087722725"},{"name":"Alvaro Luna","affiliation":["Universitat Politechnica de Catalunia (UPC), Spain"],"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Luna","id":"37294048200"},{"name":"Jose Ignacio Candela","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Jose Ignacio","lastName":"Candela","id":"38558946300"},{"name":"Pedro Rodriguez","affiliation":["Abengoa Research, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37274433700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1522-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-9-0758-1523-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7309389","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Generators","Damping","Capacitors","Voltage control","Power system stability","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric generators","phasor measurement","power system control","power system interconnection","power system reliability","rotors","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static VAr compensator","subsynchronous damping controller application","auxiliary SSDC","series compensated transmission lines","subsynchronous oscillation","wide area measurement","WAM technology","large power system interconnection","synchronized phasor measurement unit","synchronized PMU","generator rotor speed deviation signal","IEEE Second Benchmark model","SVC","power system block set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR)","Static Var Compensator (SVC)","Thyristor Controlled Reactor (TCR)","Thyristor Switched Capacitor (TSC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309389","doi":"10.1109/EPE.2015.7309389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPE.2015.7309389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309048","publicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE'15 ECCE-Europe)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7295686/7309048/07309389.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of subsynchronous damping controller to static var compensator","abstract":"This paper proposes a new auxiliary Subsynchronous Damping Controller (SSDC) for the Static Var Compensator (SVC) to damp out subsynchronous oscillations in power system containing series compensated transmission lines.

In order to keep the high speed DAQ system functional in such radiation environment where direct intervention of human is not possible, a robust and error free communication system is necessary. In this work we present an efficient DAQ design and its implementation on field programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed DAQ system supports high speed data communication (~4.8 Gbps) and achieves multi-bit error correction capabilities. BCH code (named after Raj Boseand D. K. Ray Chaudhuri) has been used for multi-bit error correction. The design has been implemented on Xilinx Kintex-7board and is tested for board to board communication as well as for board to PC using PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) interface. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FPGA based high speed DAQ system utilizing optical link and multi-bit error resiliency can be considered first of its kind. Performance estimation of the implemented DAQ system is done based on resource utilization, critical path delay, efficiency and bit error rate (BER).","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.80","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309542.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","startPage":"80","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Novel High Speed DAQ System Design with Error Correction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Based Novel High Speed DAQ System Design with Error Correction","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309542/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15571221","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309542/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Based Novel High Speed DAQ System Design with Error Correction","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055829S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309554,"authors":[{"name":"Hamzeh Ahangari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hamzeh","lastName":"Ahangari","id":"37085741277"},{"name":"Gulay Yalcin","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Gulay","lastName":"Yalcin","id":"38228396000"},{"name":"Ozcan Ozturk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozcan","lastName":"Ozturk","id":"37085750898"},{"name":"Osman Unsal","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"Unsal","id":"37328602200"},{"name":"Adrian Cristal","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Cristal","id":"37282406300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309554","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Noise","Very large scale integration","Computers","Random access memory","Circuit stability","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","integrated circuit reliability","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips","transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint SRAM","JSRAM","circuit-level technique","cache memories","circuit-level hardening","transient faults","read static noise margin","RSNM","soft errors","multi bit upsets","MBU","size 22 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM Stability","Cache Reliability","Low Power Cache"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309554","abstract":"In this paper, we propose Joint SRAM (JSRAM) cell, a novel circuit-level hardening solution for having a flexible trade-off between cache capacity and reliability. Our solution aims at addressing both permanent and transient faults in SRAM cells. JSRAM technique enhances read-stability by increasing critical Read Static Noise Margin (RSNM) to decrease faults when circuit operates at lower VDD voltages, while improving yield. It also increases hold-stability to mitigate against soft-errors, due to noise or radiation when circuit works in harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, our approach is resistant to Multi Bit Upsets (MBUs) while it is fully immune against single faults due to a novel self-correcting technique. Specifically in fault prone condition, some user pre-selected cache lines and ways are combined together vertically and horizontally at circuit level to form more robust cache cells. Four cells are joined by joiner circuits to form one robust cell. Joining cells can be selected far enough to cope with MBUs. In the case of soft-errors, this technique can be interpreted as virtually doubling transistor size. In the case of permanent faults, it can be seen as increasing \u03b2 ratio to improve readability. This approach provides versatile and flexible solution with negligible performance penalty and low area overhead. This technique requires one extra transistor per cell for joiner circuit. However, extra transistor is only involved in the reliable mode. Therefore it can be described as 6T+1T SRAM cell. While our implementation is on 6T SRAM with 22nm technology, it is applicable to other SRAM structures and technologies.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.48","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309554.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"JSRAM: A Circuit-Level Technique for Trading-Off Robustness and Capacity in Cache Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"JSRAM: A Circuit-Level Technique for Trading-Off Robustness and Capacity in Cache Memories","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309554/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15571215","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"JSRAM: A Circuit-Level Technique for Trading-Off Robustness and Capacity in Cache Memories","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058407S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309566,"authors":[{"name":"Shweta Malik","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Amherst"],"firstName":"Shweta","lastName":"Malik","id":"37085721825"},{"name":"Georg T.

The main aim of this paper is to start a discussion about hardware obfuscation in the academic community and point out open research problems. In particular, we introduce a very flexible layout-level obfuscation tool that we use as a case study for hardware obfuscation. In this obfuscation tool, a small custom-made obfuscell is used in conjunction with a standard cell to build a new obfuscated standard cell library called Obfusgates. This standard cell library can be used to synthesize any HDL code with standard synthesis tools, e.g. Synopsis Design Compiler. However, only obfuscating the functionality of individual gates is not enough. Not only the functionality of individual gates, but also their connectivity, leaks important important information about the design. In our tool we therefore designed the obfuscation gates to include a large number of \"dummy wires\". Due to these dummy wires, the connectivity of the gates in addition to their logic functionality is obfuscated. We argue that this aspect of obfuscation is of great importance in practice and that there are many interesting open research questions related to this.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.118","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309566.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Layout-Level Hardware Obfuscation Tool","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Layout-Level Hardware Obfuscation Tool","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15571166","htmlLink":"/document/7309566/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Layout-Level Hardware Obfuscation Tool","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044536S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309574,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Mahzoon","affiliation":["College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Mahzoon","id":"37085706807"},{"name":"Bijan Alizadeh","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran","College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Bijan","lastName":"Alizadeh","id":"37268305600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309574","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Accuracy","Field programmable gate arrays","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Adders","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","high level synthesis","iterative methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","iterative factorization","high level synthesis tools","HLS","hardware description language codes","HDL","high level floating point arithmetic expressions","resource usage","FPGA","associativity rule","SOAP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High level synthesis","Floating point","Optimization","Accuracy","Area","Delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309574","abstract":"Nowadays some High Level Synthesis (HLS) tools are introduced which are able to generate Hardware Description Language (HDL) codes from high level floating point arithmetic expressions for implementation on FPGAs. Before this conversion, changing the form of high level expressions usually leads to significant improvements in the final implementation in terms of accuracy, resource usage and latency. In this paper, we introduce a method to find better forms of a floating point arithmetic expression in terms of accuracy, resource usage and delay. We first come up with a solution to estimate delay and resource usage in an FPGA for a specific expression. Then we extract equivalent expressions by iterative factorization and to reduce the complexity, we select only those expressions generated by associativity rule which are better in terms of accuracy. Finally, we propose an algorithm to choose expressions from the set of equivalent expressions in terms of accuracy, resource usage and delay while let designers apply their accuracy, area and delay constraints. The results show that our proposed method in comparison with existing methods such as SOAP [10], has up to 35.2% overall improvement in terms of runtime for generating expressions and choosing expressions from the set of final expressions.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.55","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309574.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"248","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization of Floating Point Arithmetic Expressions Using Iterative Factorization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization of Floating Point Arithmetic Expressions Using Iterative Factorization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571206","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309574/","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Optimization of Floating Point Arithmetic Expressions Using Iterative Factorization","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085572S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309576,"authors":[{"name":"Zenghua Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics"],"firstName":"Zenghua","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085659974"},{"name":"Xuchong Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of AIR, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xuchong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085663401"},{"name":"Huisheng Peng","affiliation":["Hisilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Huisheng","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085658762"},{"name":"Baolu Zhai","affiliation":["Spreadtrum Communications Inc., Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Baolu","lastName":"Zhai","id":"37085660576"},{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics","Institute of AIR, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596251500"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of AIR, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085382284"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309576","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Streaming media","Encoding","Image edge detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["display devices","integrated circuit design","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","edge-preserving coding artifact reduction","coding artifacts reduction","video display processing system","in-loop techniques","post-processing methods","blocking artifacts","ringing artifacts","VLSI architecture","pixel clock","image quality","VLSI circuit","logic gates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deblocking","deringing","display processing","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"Although coding artifacts reduction is one of indispensable modules in video display processing system, its VLSI design is still rarely studied.

The combination of these three techniques should give some fundamentally new architecture with higher performances than what is available today in terms of robustness but also in terms of speed, consumption and surface.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.71","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309587.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiative Effects on MRAM-Based Non-Volatile Elementary Structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radiative Effects on MRAM-Based Non-Volatile Elementary Structures","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571183","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309587/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309587/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiative Effects on MRAM-Based Non-Volatile Elementary Structures","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056349S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7309588,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Zambelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Zambelli","id":"37397410700"},{"name":"Alessandro Grossi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Grossi","id":"37346759100"},{"name":"Piero Olivo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Olivo","id":"38549671500"},{"name":"Christian Walczyk","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Walczyk","id":"37394175300"},{"name":"Christian Wenger","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Wenger","id":"37316239800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309588","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309588","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Switches","Reliability","Dispersion","Oscillators","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RRAM reliability","RRAM performance characterization","array architectures","nonvolatile memory","nonvolatile memories","CMOS backend-of-line process","first glance estimation","technology optimization","efficient algorithms codesign"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM","test-structures","array","reliability","performance"]}],"abstract":"The reliability and performance characterization of each non-volatile memory technology requires the thorough investigation of dedicated array test structures that mimic the real operations of a fully functional integrated product.

Non-volatility leads to zero-standby leakage. However, at the same time, exploration of energy-efficient read and write mechanisms is important to lower the overall energy-consumption of an MRAM cache. Magnetization control employing spin-hall effect is one of the most promising approaches to enhance the write energy efficiency. A separate path for the read which comprises of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) offers the benefits of simultaneous optimization of the read and write operations. In fact, spin-hall effect also leads to the possibility of designing cells with differential sensing. However, the advantages of a differential read over a single-ended read in terms of higher read speed and better noise immunity comes at the cost of larger number of access transistors, which may translate to lower integration density. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of spin-hall effect (SHE) based MRAM cells with single-ended and differential read mechanisms in terms of the cell area, read performance and read stability. We perform a detailed layout analysis based on Fin FET technology to evaluate the impact of introducing differential sensing on cell area. Our analysis shows that when the layout area is determined by the pitch of the bit-line and source-line metal tracks, the differential cell shows 1.5X increase in the cell area compared to the single-ended SHE MRAM. The area increase is 2X if the read access transistor determines the layout footprint. However, the differential sensing offers the advantages of ~48% increase in the read performance along with 6% to 9% boost in the read stability compared to the single-ended SHE MRAM. At iso-area, the differential cell shows ~24% lower read time and 12% higher read disturb margin with a similar write performance and power. Our analysis also presents other layout-driven perspectives on the design of differential and single-ended SHE MRAMs.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.52","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309589.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Ended and Differential MRAMs Based on Spin Hall Effect: A Layout-Aware Design Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Single-Ended and Differential MRAMs Based on Spin Hall Effect: A Layout-Aware Design Perspective","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309589/","accessionNumber":"15571176","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Ended and Differential MRAMs Based on Spin Hall Effect: A Layout-Aware Design Perspective","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067768S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7309592,"authors":[{"name":"Hossam Sarhan","affiliation":["Univ.

Previous partitioning methodologies focus on minimizing number of 3D interconnects for equal area ratio between the stacked partitions. This paper demonstrates that un-balancing the tier to tier area ratio of the M3D design brings better performance than classical balanced 3D design approach. Our study highlights that neither balanced area ratio nor the number of 3D interconnections remains mandatory criteria for M3D.

The main expectation of this technology is that, during this comparison, no information leaks from the memory, which is interesting against side channel attacks. This assumption has been verified by simulation but not in practice yet. This paper proposes a new secure AES implementation based on the MIP technology.

For example, the intrinsic stochastic switching characteristics and asymmetry of the STT driven magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), as well as the process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations of the manufacturing process. Generally, there exists a technical gap between the device-level designers and system-level circuit or system designers for the STT-MRAM optimizations. To our knowledge, no efficient evaluation tools have been proposed to provide an effective link between them until now. In this paper, we aim to firstly give quantitative analyses of the reliability issues of STT-MRAM, taking into consideration the physical properties and manufacturing process. Secondly, based on these analysis results, a channel model from informative perspective would then be proposed. This model provides an effective simulation tool to evaluate the reliability performance of STT-MRAM.

Weak PUFs (i.e., devices able to generate a single signature or to deal with a limited number of challenges) and Strong PUFs (i.e., devices able to deal with multiple challenges) are widely discussed in literature. The most investigated solutions today are based on CMOS devices. However, with the rapid development of low power, high density, high performance SoCs new technologies have emerged. One of the most promising choices to replace charge-based computing is the spin-based computing, due to its reduced read/write latency and high CMOS integration capability. In this paper, we propose an innovative PUF design based on Spin-Transfer-Torque-MRAM memory. We exploit the high variability affecting the electrical resistance of the Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) device and special configurations of the reference cells for the read operation. The reference cell array is configured in such a way to allow for normal memory operation, and, when required, allow for signature generation (PUF solution). Switching between memory and PUF is done by controlling the state of the referencing array. In this way, we can generate multiple challenges for the implementation of a Strong PUF solution. We demonstrate that the proposed solution is robust, unclonable and unpredictable.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Magnetic tunneling","Reliability","Resistance","Magnetization","Hamming distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","magnetoelectronics","MRAM devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STT-MRAM","strong PUF architecture","physically unclonable functions","cryptographic primitives","spin transfer torque MRAM memory","magnetic tunnel junction device","reference cell array","signature generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emerging Memory Technology","MRAMs","Phisical Unclonable Functions PUFs","Security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309614","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.128","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.128","startPage":"467","endPage":"472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"STT-MRAM-Based Strong PUF Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"STT-MRAM-Based Strong PUF Architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309614/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309614/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15571200","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STT-MRAM-Based Strong PUF Architecture","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046407S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7309615,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"},{"name":"Anand Raghunathan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Raghunathan","id":"37275475300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309615","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":940},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309615","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Energy efficiency","Hardware","Digital signal processing","Computer architecture","Discrete cosine transforms","Resilience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate computing","energy-efficient computing technique","error resilient applications","energy consumption","multimedia applications","recognition application","vision application","digital signal processing","DSP","image processing","sound processing","video processing","numerical precision","approximate computation","approximate signal processing","incremental refinement utilization"]}],"abstract":"Approximate computing has become a well-known computing technique in recent years. It relies on the ability of many systems and applications to self-heal or to tolerate some loss of quality or optimality in the computed result. The main idea is to exploit the inherent error resiliency or error tolerance of the system to achieve energy efficiency, or in other words, trading accuracy with energy consumption. Such trade-off, in most cases, is also associated with performance improvements like faster operations, area reduction etc. Fortunately, most of the heavy workloads nowadays exhibit intrinsic application resilience. In most multimedia applications, the final output is interpreted by human senses, which are not perfect. This fact averts the need to produce exact outputs. Recent research efforts have quantitatively ascertained the high degree of inherent resilience in many applications. For example, our analysis of a benchmark suite of 12 recognition, vision and multimedia applications shows that on average, 83% of the runtime is spent in computations that can tolerate at least some degree of approximation. Therefore, there is a potential to leverage inherent resilience in a broad context. Let us consider digital signal processing (DSP). In multi-media applications, DSP blocks implement image, sound and video processing algorithms, where the final output is either an image or sound or a video for human senses. When interpreting an image or a sound or a video, human beings have limited perceptual capacities. This allows the system to be flexible in producing quality outputs. As an example, the relaxation on numerical precision provides some freedom to carry out imprecise or approximate computation. Another example of approximate signal processing is the utilization of incremental refinement. It is evident that the tradeoffs may allow approximate computing to handle tasks beyond what we can do with traditional computing.There are different levels of design abstraction where approximate computing methods can be implemented. In this paper we will briefly describe different approaches that we have developed to implement approximate hardware for error resilient applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.130","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309615.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Computing: An Energy-Efficient Computing Technique for Error Resilient Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Computing: An Energy-Efficient Computing Technique for Error Resilient Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15571205","htmlLink":"/document/7309615/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Computing: An Energy-Efficient Computing Technique for Error Resilient Applications","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052243S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7309616,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremy Schlachter","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICLAB), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Schlachter","id":"37085420936"},{"name":"Vincent Camus","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICLAB), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Camus","id":"37085411128"},{"name":"Christian Enz","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory (ICLAB), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Enz","id":"37085390786"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309616","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Logic gates","Accuracy","Delays","Hardware","Error analysis","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","electronic engineering computing","logic design","low-power electronics","threshold logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inexact circuits","error metrics","approximate adders","carry speculation","gate-level pruning","arithmetic circuits","process-voltage-temperature variations","PVT variations","power consumption","ultra low-power systems","approximate computing","near-threshold circuit design","sub-threshold circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate computing","inexact circuits","speculative adder","pruning","sub-threshold"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309616","abstract":"While sub/near-threshold design offers the minimal power and energy consumption, such approach strongly deteriorates circuit performances and robustness against PVT (process/voltage/temperature) variations, leading to gigantic speed penalties and large silicon areas.

After the failure of weak cells and in presence of large number of failed lines, some techniques have been proposed to further prolong the lifetime of a PCM device by remapping failed lines to spares and salvage a PCM device with graceful degradation. Others rely on handling failures through inter-line pairing. Observations reveal that most of cells in a line are healthy when the line is marked as faulty by any of these proposals. To overcome this deficiency, we propose Intra-line Level Pairing(ILP), a technique that mitigates the problem of fast failure of lines by coupling faulty parts of a line onto other healthy parts of the same line. The target part of the line is programmed in the Multi-Level Cell (MLC) mode to keep data of both the faulty and target parts. Evaluation results for multi-threaded and multi-program workloads reveal noticeable improvement in time-to-failure and performance over existing techniques. Note that ILP is also orthogonal to all known line-level and page-level techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.94","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309625.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Intra-Line Level Pairing for Graceful Degradation Support in PCMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309625/","displayDocTitle":"Using Intra-Line Level Pairing for Graceful Degradation Support in PCMs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309625/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15597942","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Intra-Line Level Pairing for Graceful Degradation Support in PCMs","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046696S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309633,"authors":[{"name":"Prateek Puri","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer EngineeringVirginia Tech, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Prateek","lastName":"Puri","id":"37085752086"},{"name":"Michael S.

In this paper, we introduce a test generation algorithm using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) to generate high-quality test sequences that achieve high branch coverage in short execution times for synthesizable RTL designs. Initially, a global search is conducted using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization which is later supported by a controlled graphical search method to reach target corner cases. The controlled search uses the control-flow graph to provide hints at critical points in the state space to reach hard corner cases. The fast convergence of BPSO allows the proposed method to deliver high coverage while generating short final test sequences. Substantial speedups over the state of the art methods have also been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.26","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309633.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"578","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Stimuli Generation for Design Validation of RTL Circuits Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast Stimuli Generation for Design Validation of RTL Circuits Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15571238","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309633/","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Stimuli Generation for Design Validation of RTL Circuits Using Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106677S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7309636,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Cladera","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes 1"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Cladera","id":"37085731000"},{"name":"Matthieu Gautier","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes 1"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Gautier","id":"37085549652"},{"name":"Olivier Sentieys","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes 1"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Sentieys","id":"37281694500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309636","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Energy consumption","OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","error statistics","field programmable gate arrays","mobile computing","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","power aware computing","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","radiowave propagation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware computing","adaptive precision","performance constraints","OFDM wireless receivers","performance margin","bit error rate","channel condition estimation","energy savings","run time processing bit-width","dynamic energy consumption","FPGA","soft SIMD","mobile wireless channels","time-varying multipath propagation","interference effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy aware system","Dynamic bit-width","OFDM communication"]}],"abstract":"To cope with rapid variations of channel parameters, wireless receivers are designed with a significant performance margin to reach a given Bit Error Rate (BER), even for the worst-case channel conditions. Indeed, one of the steps during the design phase is the choice of the architecture bit-width, and the smallest word length that ensures the correct behaviour of the receiver is usually chosen. In this paper, an adaptive precision OFDM receiver is proposed. Significant energy savings come from varying at run time processing bit-width, based on estimation of channel conditions, without compromising the BER constraints. To validate the energy savings, the energy consumption of basic operators has been obtained from real measurements for different bit-widths on a FPGA and a processor using soft SIMD. Results show that up to 63% of the dynamic energy consumption can be saved using this adaptive technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.88","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel7/7307713/7308659/07309636.pdf","startPage":"591","endPage":"596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2015.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7308659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Computing via Adaptive Precision under Performance Constraints in OFDM Wireless Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309636/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Computing via Adaptive Precision under Performance Constraints in OFDM Wireless Receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15571253","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309636/","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Computing via Adaptive Precision under Performance Constraints in OFDM Wireless Receivers","confLoc":"Montpellier, France","sourcePdf":"8719a591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085964S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7307713","isNumber":"7308659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7307713","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7308659","articleId":"7309636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309638,"authors":[{"name":"Yassine Fkih","affiliation":["CEA-Leti, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France","LIRMM, Univ Montpellier II/CNRS, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Yassine","lastName":"Fkih","id":"37072811600"},{"name":"Pascal Vivet","affiliation":["CEA-Leti, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Vivet","id":"37298711200"},{"name":"Marie-Lise Flottes","affiliation":["LIRMM, Univ Montpellier II/CNRS, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Lise","lastName":"Flottes","id":"37085563875"},{"name":"Bruno Rouzeyre","affiliation":["LIRMM, Univ Montpellier II/CNRS, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Rouzeyre","id":"37085729590"},{"name":"Giorgio Di Natale","affiliation":["LIRMM, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, Languedoc-Roussillon, FR"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Di Natale","id":"37296347200"},{"name":"Juergen Schloeffel","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Schloeffel","id":"37274016100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8719-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8718-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"7309638","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Through-silicon vias","Discrete Fourier transforms","Built-in self-test","Instruments","Ring oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","integrated circuit bonding","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit testing","microassembling","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D DFT challenges","design-for-test","3D stacked integrated circuits","through silicon vias","TSV","inter-die interconnections","die bonding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-IC","Design-For-Testability","IEEE 1687","test scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Design-For-Test (DFT) of 3D stacked integrated circuits based on Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) is one of the hot topics in the field of test of integrated circuits.

DFT of 3D circuits concerns all the components of the 3D system, including the dies and the inter-die interconnections.

In this presentation, coupled inductor concept is applied to interleaved MHz totem-pole CRM PFC converter with GaN devices. The coupled inductor in CRM PFC converter can reduce switching frequency variation, help achieving ZVS and reduce circulating energy. Therefore the coupled inductor can improve the efficiency of PFC converter. In addition, balance technique is applied to help minimize CM noise. This paper will introduce how to achieve balance with coupled inductor. The novel PCB winding inductor design will be provided. The PCB winding coupled inductor will have similar loss with litz wire inductor but much less labor in manufacture.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309693","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07309693.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common mode EMI reduction technique for interleaved MHz critical mode PFC converter with coupled inductor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309693/","displayDocTitle":"Common mode EMI reduction technique for interleaved MHz critical mode PFC converter with coupled inductor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569700","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309693/","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common mode EMI reduction technique for interleaved MHz critical mode PFC converter with coupled inductor","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00331313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046248S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7309693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7309707,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Karamanakos","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Karamanakos","id":"37847757200"},{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37391100100"},{"name":"Ralph Kennel","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Kennel","id":"38557336200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7309707","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Lattices","Optimization","Switches","Inverters","Search problems","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","optimisation","predictive control","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal search strategy","bounded computational complexity","long-horizon direct model predictive control problems","MPC problem","optimization problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309707","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309707","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","abstract":"Search algorithms that reduce the time to solve the direct model predictive control (MPC) problem are proposed in this paper.

Thanks to the second approach, a preset upper limit on the operations performed in real time is not exceeded, thus guaranteeing realtime termination in all runs.

However, the current trends in the development of the future electrical networks evidence that it is technically feasible and economically advantageous to keep feeding islanded systems under these situations, without cutting the power supply to the loads connected to the network. Nevertheless, commercial PV power converters are programmed as grid-feeding converters, and they are unable to work in island mode if there is not an agent forming the grid. In order to overcome this problem the Synchronous Power Controller (SPC) is presented in this paper as a suitable alternative for controlling PV inverters. As it will be further discussed this controller permits PV plants to operate seamless in grid connected and island mode, with no need of changing the control structure in any case. Moreover, the participation of SPC based power converters integrating energy storage enables other grid-feeding systems to contribute to the grid operation in island conditions. The results achieved with the SPC will be shown in simulations and also with experiments considering a real PV power plant combining SPC and comercial converters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Synchronous generators","Impedance","Reactive power","Load modeling","Frequency conversion","Current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","energy storage","power control","power convertors","power distribution control","power distribution economics","power distribution faults","power distribution reliability","power generation control","power generation economics","power grids","solar power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible grid connection","SPC-based PV power converter islanding","photovoltaic power plant","antiislanding algorithm","converter controller","grid-feeding converter","synchronous power controller problem","energy storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dc-ac power converters","Photovoltaic systems","Electric variables control","Distributed Power Generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309723","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07309723.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible grid connection and islanding of SPC-based PV power converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Flexible grid connection and islanding of SPC-based PV power converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309723/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309723/","accessionNumber":"15569474","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible grid connection and islanding of SPC-based PV power converters","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00630896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084325S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7309723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7309759,"authors":[{"name":"Dorin O.

Simulation results show that the predictive current control with active damping method has an excellent steady-state response as well as an extremely fast dynamic response compared with the conventional method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7309812/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15569984","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predictive current control of a current-source inverter with active damping method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive current control of a current-source inverter with active damping method","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01530919.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065731S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7309812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7309844,"authors":[{"name":"Xinbo Liu","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Electric Vehicles, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinbo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085385733"},{"name":"Shuohan Ma","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Electric Vehicles, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuohan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37578537400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7309844","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"abstract":"In the DC power systems of More Electric Aircraft, the closed-loop controlled electrical motor drives and power electronic converters can be generally regarded as constant power loads (CPLs), and usually lead to negative impedance-related instability.

The simple criteria utilize the dynamic negative impedance of the CPLs to place quantitative constraints on the filter parameters, and provide important design guidelines during the filter determination. Comparisons demonstrate the stability criterion for the CPLs with a single-stage LC filter can be regarded as a special case of the proposed criteria. The region of asymptotic stability (RAS) around the stable equilibrium point is obtained, and it indicates the criteria can guarantee the system stability during large disturbances.

The concept is based on using a series pass device (SPD), which acts as a controllable current source, to program the input current waveform of the converter. The quiescent point of the SPD is stabilized at the boundary between the linear and saturation region by regulating the voltage across the SPD near its saturation voltage. Thus, the power loss of the SPD is minimized. Experiments reveal that the overall efficiency is found to be comparable with the conventional passive-type filter. This paper will firstly discuss possible occurrence of limit cycles under peak-voltage control to regulate the voltage across the SPD, and will then examine the use of a stabilizing ramp in the pulsewidth modulator to tackle such phenomenon. The effectiveness of the introduced stabilizing ramp will be exemplified experimentally on a 48W, 40-140V/24V buck converter.

The automatic current sharing mechanism is inherent to the series capacitor buck topology and uniquely utilizes its series capacitor. Unlike conventional multiphase buck converters, current sharing is achieved without any current sensing circuits or added external control loops. Analysis of the automatic current sharing mechanism explains its robustness to variations in inductance, dc resistance (DCR), and temperature. Unequal control switch on-times are found to have measurable impact on sharing accuracy. Results from a two-phase, 12 V input, 10 A output hardware prototype demonstrate the simple, highly accurate current sharing capabilities of the series capacitor buck converter. Experimental results for unequal on-times exhibit unmatched average currents but stable operation with a dc offset.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309943","startPage":"2003","endPage":"2009","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07309943.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic current sharing mechanism in the series capacitor buck converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Automatic current sharing mechanism in the series capacitor buck converter","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309943/","accessionNumber":"15569589","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309943/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic current sharing mechanism in the series capacitor buck converter","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"02840462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065879S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7309943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7309948,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Tang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37403083500"},{"name":"Changwoo Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Changwoo","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085490443"},{"name":"Rongwu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Rongwu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085369358"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7151-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7150-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"7309948","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Current control","Frequency control","Power system stability","Damping","Stability analysis","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","electric current control","power filters","power grids","power system stability","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current control generalized stability region","LCL-filtered grid-connected converter","closed-loop control system stability","LCL resonance frequency","resonance frequency","sampling frequency","system controller design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["active damping","current control","LCL-filter","Nyquist Frequency","resonance frequency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7309948","abstract":"This paper investigates the stability regions of current control for LCL-filtered grid-connected converters, where no active or passive damping is required to stabilize the closed-loop control system. It is already identified in the literature that if the LCL resonance frequency is placed within 1/6 to 1/2 of the system sampling frequency, the grid current control can be directly used without damping. If the resonance frequency is smaller than 1/6 of the sampling frequency, the converter current control should then be adopted. This paper further extends the analysis to the cases where the resonance frequency could be larger than 1/2 of the sampling frequency, and derives the complete stability regions for both grid and converter current control. Interestingly, it is found that for any given LCL-filter design, there will always be one stable current control design without any damping, which may greatly facilitate the system controller design. Two design examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed LCL-filter and current controller design. These theoretical analyses are also supported with simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2015.7309948","startPage":"2040","endPage":"2047","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298093/7309651/07309948.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7309651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized stability regions of current control for LCL-filtered grid-connected converters without passive or active damping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Generalized stability regions of current control for LCL-filtered grid-connected converters without passive or active damping","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7309948/","accessionNumber":"15569901","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7309948/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized stability regions of current control for LCL-filtered grid-connected converters without passive or active damping","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"02890352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068893S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298093","isNumber":"7309651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7298093","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7309651","articleId":"7309948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7309951,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Fei","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Fei","id":"37085553390"},{"name":"Fred C.

SOTC can improve the transient performance of the LLC converters by immediately changing the pulse width of the primary driving signal during the load transient.

The proposed Multi-step SOTC calculates the trajectory based on only the output voltage and the load current, and settles the resonant tank within multi steps. With the proposed Multi-step SOTC, low-cost controllers can be used to control the high frequency LLC converters with the state-trajectory control concept. The number of steps in multi-step SOTC is selected based on the speed of the controller and the switching frequency of the LLC converters.

However, the high di/dt and dv/dt associated with fast switching as well as the circuit parasitic elements raise various issues. In this paper, a double-pulse characterization fixture is built to test a 1200 V/100 A SiC device, from which the high speed switching issues, including device current and voltage resonances and spikes, gate terminal resonance, cross-talk, gate driver noise, and electromagnetic interference (EMI), are presented. All the switching waveform resonances and their associated parasitic elements are exploited and explained. Results show that due to these issues, the devices are prevented from full utilization of either the safe operation area (SOA) or the maximum switching speed. Finally, the device model considering all the parasitic elements is tested with a soft-switching circuit-resonant DC link converter, showing that the above stated issues are significantly mitigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition
