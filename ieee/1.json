However, BCD arithmetic operations are often slow and require complex hardware. One can eliminate the need for carry propagation and thus improve performance of BCD operations by using a redundant binary-coded decimal (RBCD) system. The VLSI design of an RBCD adder is introduced. The design consists of two small PLAs and two four-bit binary adders for one digit of the RBCD adder. The addition delay is constant for n-digit RBCD addition (no carry propagation delay). The VLSI time and space complexities of the design, as well as its layout are presented, showing the regularity of the structures. Two simple algorithms and the corresponding hardware designs for conversion between RBCD and BCD are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.1988.10042","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers an Communications. 1988 Conference Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh Annual International Phoenix Conference on Computers an Communications. 1988 Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/191/514/00010042.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.1988.10042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI designs for redundant binary-coded decimal addition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Mar 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/10042/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI designs for redundant binary-coded decimal addition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3197875","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI designs for redundant binary-coded decimal addition","confLoc":"Scottsdale, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00010042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04593S","chronDate":"16-18 Mar 1988","isNumber":"514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"191","citationCount":"5","articleId":"10042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":10047,"authors":[{"name":"V.K.

Two models have been built using SLAM (Simulation Language for Alternative Modeling). The first model is for the no-retry case. The second model allows the network to be studied under various retry protocols. The first model gives a maximum throughput of 0.188, which is close to the analytical result.

Others concern details such as an improved method for transmission of signalling and supervisory information and to take into account any recommendations resulting from the human factors study.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite communications experiment for the Ontario air ambulance service","publicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1988.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth International Conference on Satellite Systems for Mobile Communications and Navigation, 1988.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1243/520/00010407.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"86","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00010407.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=520","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/10407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct 1988","displayDocTitle":"Satellite communications experiment for the Ontario air ambulance service","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3318262","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite communications experiment for the Ontario air ambulance service","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00010407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017766S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct 1988","isNumber":"520","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1243","citationCount":"2","articleId":"10407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":10408,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

When a resonant rectifier is coupled to a resonant inverter in this manner, a fully resonant DC-to-DC converter is produced.

This zero-voltage resonant-transition (ZVRT) switching technique can be applied to conventional buck, boost, and buck-boost power converter topologies that operate with a constant switching frequency and use pulsewidth modulation for output control. Since frequency-dependent losses are greatly reduced in the power transistors, efficient operation at higher switching frequencies (>1 MHz) is allowed. However, conduction losses are increased because ripple currents are increased and synchronous rectification is required.

However, in the simulation of structures with large chip-to-heat-source size ratios, the computer program based on the exact solution requires a substantial amount of CPU time, making it impossible to carry out real-time thermal design of ICs having large numbers of small heat sources. A method is presented for the computer-aided thermal design of ICs in real time. This method uses a multiple regression technique whose input is the thermal profile due to a unit heat source over a multilayered unit structure. The profile in two dimensions is matched to an equation having several parameters. The temperature profiles of other devices having the same layered structure is computed by superposing the profile generated by the matched equation, shifted in position according to the source location and weighted by the source power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/10612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb 1988","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3198208","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Thermal design of integrated circuit devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal design of integrated circuit devices","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00010612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029536S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb 1988","isNumber":"523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"715","citationCount":"6","articleId":"10612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":10778,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Although a flash ADC offers a sufficiently high conversion rate for video applications, it has a high power consumption because of its large number of comparators. The two-step parallel ADC, on the other hand, has significantly fewer comparators, and thus a lower power consumption and, because its chip size is smaller, it can be made at lower cost. A conventional two-step parallel ADC has, however, three problems: a relatively slow conversion rate, a relatively poor differential linearity, and the need for a peripheral sample-and-hold circuit. The authors report a new 8-bit two-step parallel ADC which solves these problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.1988.10778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Consumer Electronics Digest of Technical Papers.","pdfPath":"/iel2/725/525/00010778.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.1988.10778","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1988 International Conference on Consumer Electronics Digest of Technical Papers.","startPage":"238","endPage":"239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS 8-bit 20MHz two-step parallel A/D converter with 95mW power consumption","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS 8-bit 20MHz two-step parallel A/D converter with 95mW power consumption","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/10778/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3371912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS 8-bit 20MHz two-step parallel A/D converter with 95mW power consumption","confLoc":"Rosemount, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00010778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026278S","chronDate":"8-10 June 1988","isNumber":"525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"725","citationCount":"4","articleId":"10778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":10933,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

A brief review of motion compensation for SAR is presented followed by a presentation of the effects of strapdown IMU sensor and system errors on SAR image quality. These errors include the following: gyro and accelerometer scale factor and bias errors, velocity error, and platform tilt, and errors induced by limited inertial sensor bandwidth. The effects of these errors on the SAR image quality are presented in terms of the SAR impulse response.

The computation compression technique (CCT) used is a method of trading computations for memory. By using larger memories, the amount of computation time required to implement a function can be reduced. Results show approximately a three-fold speedup over FFT implementations using an HP 350 processor. It is noted that the CCT is much more easily parallelized than the FFT approach, which can further reduce computation times.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/732/528/00010944.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1988 IEEE National Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1988.10944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1988.10944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computation compression technique for SAR based on vector quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Synthetic aperture radar","Data compression","Distortion measurement","Encoding","Product codes","Focusing","Convolutional codes","Radar imaging","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","focusing","radar theory","telecommunications computing","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computation compression technique","vector quantization","data compression","synthetic-aperture radar","processing requirements","SAR focusing","memory","HP 350 processor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/10944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"A computation compression technique for SAR based on vector quantization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3219079","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-21 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computation compression technique for SAR based on vector quantization","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00010944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071818S","chronDate":"20-21 Apr 1988","isNumber":"528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"732","citationCount":"3","articleId":"10944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":11010,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Pollack","affiliation":["Crawford Hill Laboratory, AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Pollack","id":"37424971800"}],"articleNumber":"11010","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["III-V semiconductor materials","Gallium arsenide","Optical devices","Photonic integrated circuits","Monolithic integrated circuits","Integrated optics","Optical materials","Substrates","Optical crosstalk","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","integrated optoelectronics","reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductors","reviews","III-V optoelectronic integrated circuits","OEICs","research","development directions","GaAs integrated circuits"]}],"abstract":"Optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) are monolithic semiconductor components which combine a variety of optical and electronic functions on a single chip.

A maximum small-signal gain of 26 dB was obtained with 4 V on the drain and 0 V on the gate. When biased for large-signal operation, the amplifier was capable of generating 112 mW output power with 16-dB gain and 21.6% power-added efficiency at 34 GHz.

A cascode configuration has been used to reduce the coupling effects and therefore to improve the frequency bandwidth of the amplifier. A 6+or-1-dB gain was obtained from 2 to 42 GHz. In particular, a gain ripple better than +or-0.5 dB up to 26.5 GHz was measured directly on wafer. The I/O VSWRs (voltage standing wave ratios) are less than 2.5 over the entire bandwidth. The average noise figure of the amplifier is 4.2 at 12 GHz, rising to 5.2 at 18 GHz. The chip size is 2.3*0.9 mm/sup 2/. It is concluded that the results show that monolithic microwave integrated circuits using HEMTs are very promising for MM-wave applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAAS.1988.11036","publicationTitle":"10th Annual IEEE (GaAs IC) Symposium, Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit.

A simplified 3- mu m emitter, self-aligned base metal HBT process is used to fabricate transistors with f/sub max/ approximately=30-50 GHz, high linearity, and low 1/f noise, yielding significantly improved third-order intermodulation product intercept point (IP3) and oscillator performance. The HBT IP3 ranges from 20-35 dBm for 12-20 GHz with a linearity figure-of-merit ratio, IP3(mW)/input DC power (mW), approximately=4 to 20 times higher than comparable HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors) and MESFETs at 12 to 37.7 GHz with -82 dBc/Hz phase noise at 100-kHz offset.

These magnets produce a large fringe field that interferes with other imaging equipment in a clinical environment. An approach to shielding magnets using primary shielding, which is comprised of a light-weight flux-return yoke near the magnet and secondary shielding in the desired direction, was developed. Primary shieldings for 0.5 T and 2 T were developed, built, and tested at the authors' company, and installed at customer sites. It was found that this approach to shielding is the most cost effective in terms of using steel and achieving good homogeneity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.11473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/535/00011473.pdf","startPage":"1288","endPage":"1291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.11473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design and use of secondary shielding in MRI systems-experiments from 4 years of operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The design and use of secondary shielding in MRI systems-experiments from 4 years of operation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/11473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1988","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"March 1988","accessionNumber":"3232898","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design and use of secondary shielding in MRI systems-experiments from 4 years of operation","sourcePdf":"00011473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024741S","chronDate":"March  1988","isNumber":"535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","articleId":"11473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":11585,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The system accepts a behavioral description of a digital system design written in VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), and produces the physical hardware, at the register-transfer level, needed for realizing the specified behavior. The synthesis system comprises three major subsystems: process graph analyzer, design representation, and the MIMOLA synthesis system. The process graph analyzer is an optimization and parallelization tool. It is shown how optimizing techniques used for compilers are adapted to perform a similar optimization function for hardware synthesis. Techniques are presented that extend the parallelization of sequential programs concept for doing control-state partitioning. The technique is novel because of the unique synthesis model that MIMOLA uses. It is shown how to integrate these concepts using a suitable intermediate behavioral representation called the process graph.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/11772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3140545","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1988","displayDocTitle":"Process graph analyzer: a front end tool for VHDL behavioral synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process graph analyzer: a front end tool for VHDL behavioral synthesis","confLoc":"Kailua-Kona, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00011772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041463S","chronDate":"0-0  1988","isNumber":"537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"196","citationCount":"5","articleId":"11772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":11870,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The subspace method focuses on feature extraction for powerful pattern class representation, but does not involve only pattern classification; (2) the concept of near-miss in ARCH can be simulated with the subspace method; (3) M.

If a sentence s in L/sub NS/ is translated into a formula t, then the semantics of s is defined to be the semantics of t in the system. The definition of nonlogical words such as nouns and verbs are given as axioms. A processing system for natural-language specifications that is based on this method has been implemented. Since the number of nonlogical words is very large and their semantics depend on problem domains, it seems to be difficult to define the semantics of all the words from the beginning. The system not only translates specifications into formulas but also supports dictionary expansion. Several specifications have been analyzed using the system, and the nonlogical words have been defined and stored in the dictionary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/11876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1988","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"5-8 Jan. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3129414","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A processing system for programming specifications in a natural language","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A processing system for programming specifications in a natural language","confLoc":"Kailua-Kona, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00011876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038198S","chronDate":"0-0  1988","isNumber":"538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"197","citationCount":"3","articleId":"11876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":11959,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The solutions may be optimized on a criterion function or on physical constraints, such as obstacle avoidance. Stability and convergence of the method are shown. Although its convergence rate is only about half that of Newton's method, the advantage of the method is that it remains easily tractable close to the singular configurations of the manipulator. A hybrid method combining the Jacobian transpose and Newton's methods is proposed. Results of the application of the method on a 10-link manipulator in 2-D space are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse kinematic algorithms for redundant systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12021","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012021.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"48 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=12021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Inverse kinematic algorithms for redundant systems","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3247360","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse kinematic algorithms for redundant systems","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024103S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"44","articleId":"12021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":12037,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

Data exchange between the FPPs is facilitated by a dual shift-broadcast network. High-speed dual I/O channels are provided so that input/output bottlenecks are avoided. The RVP uses a RISC (reduced-instruction-set-computer) architecture with seven basic instructions. Composite vector operations such as matrix-vector multiply and vector cross product may be readily programmed using the basic instruction set to given considerable overlap.

When two industrial robots grasp a single object, the total number of degrees of freedom is usually greater than six. Thus, the joint torques of two robots for a required motion of the object is not unique. The redundant degrees of freedom may be used to optimize certain kind of performance. The least energy consumption is selected as the optimization criterion. Optimal algorithms without and with a bound on the joint torques are investigated. The results show that the algorithms are computationally complicated and not suitable for real-time applications. Alternatively, optimal algorithms are proposed for load distribution with minimum exerted forces on the object. These algorithms require less computational time, which makes them attractive for real-time applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12072/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3227980","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal load distribution for two industrial robots handling a single object","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal load distribution for two industrial robots handling a single object","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050235S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"130","articleId":"12072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":12073,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is thought that the electric resistance value of an SMA can be utilized to monitor the transformation of the SMA directly. Therefore, an antagonistic transformation control scheme using electric resistance feedback is proposed and is verified by several experiments. This control scheme reduces the open-loop hysteresis of an SMA actuator and improves greatly its robustness against heat disturbance due to changes in the cooling condition. Research into the application of the method in an active endoscope is reported. It consists of five segments of 13 mm diameter, 40 mm length each. The bending angle of each segment can be controlled individually from outside by using antagonistic electric resistance feedback without any motion sensors. A model for smooth insertion to the colon is verified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12085","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","startPage":"427","endPage":"430 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape memory alloy servo actuator system with electric resistance feedback and application for active endoscope","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=12085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shape memory alloy servo actuator system with electric resistance feedback and application for active endoscope","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12085/","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3238543","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape memory alloy servo actuator system with electric resistance feedback and application for active endoscope","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032999S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"183","articleId":"12085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":12096,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The calibration can be done within a fraction of a millisecond after the robot finishes the movement. The setup is simple (a planar set of calibration points arbitrarily placed on the work table, in addition to robot and camera) and is the same as that for a common camera calibration. This method is claimed to be faster, simpler, and more accurate than any existing technique for hand/eye calibration. Generic geometric properties of lemmas are presented, leading to the derivation of the final algorithms, which are aimed at simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy while giving ample geometric and algebraic insights. Besides describing the technique, critical factors influencing the accuracy are analysed, and procedures for improving accuracy are introduced. Tests results of both simulation and real experiments on an IBM Cartesian robot are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12110/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3228015","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","displayDocTitle":"Real time versatile robotics hand/eye calibration using 3D machine vision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time versatile robotics hand/eye calibration using 3D machine vision","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042182S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"80","articleId":"12110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":12114,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The simulations, using an electrical circuit model, reproduce the behavior of the real system, including effects of human operator biomechanics. It is shown that human operator properties, which vary as a result of different types of grasp of the handle, affect the stability of the system in the hard-contact task. The effect of a heavier grasp on the handle is equivalent to increased hand-controlled velocity damping in terms of the systems stability in the contact task, but control system damping sufficient to guarantee stable contact results in perceptible sluggishness of the control handle's response in free motion. These results suggest that human operator biomechanics must be taken into account to guarantee stable and ergonomic performance of advanced teleoperators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12114","startPage":"584","endPage":"589 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012114.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and simulation studies of hard contact in force reflecting teleoperation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Force control","Master-slave","Biomechanics","Damping","Motion control","Velocity control","Control systems","Contacts","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","man-machine systems","position control","robots","telecontrol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","position control","telecontrol","robots","hard contact","force reflecting teleoperation","hand controller","manipulator","electrical circuit model","biomechanics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and simulation studies of hard contact in force reflecting teleoperation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","accessionNumber":"3228019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and simulation studies of hard contact in force reflecting teleoperation","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06133S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"99","articleId":"12114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":12142,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A novel indirect adaptive controller structure, which consists of a modified computed torque using parameters obtained from any of the estimators discussed, is presented. It is shown that a critical difficulty in using indirect adaptive control is the necessity to explicitly guarantee that the estimated inertia matrix remains positive definite in the course of adaptation, a requirement avoided by both the direct and the composite adaptive controllers.

The model consists of three kinds of maps: a sensor map, a local map, and a global map. A range image (sensor map) is transformed to a height map (local map) with respect to a mobile robot. The height map is segmented into four categories (unexplored, occluded, traversable, and obstacle regions) for obstacle detection and path planning. Obstacle regions are classified into artificial objects or natural objects using both the height image and video image. One drawback of height map-the recovery of vertical planes-is overcome by the utilization of multiple height maps which include the maximum and minimum heights of each point, and the number of points in the range image mapped into one point in the height map. The multiple height map is useful not only for finding vertical planes in the height map but also for segmentation of the video image. Height maps are integrated into a global map by matching geometrical properties and updating region labels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12177","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00012177.png","startPage":"918","endPage":"923 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012177.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building a 3D world model for mobile robot from sensory data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Cameras","Surface fitting","Image segmentation","Sonar navigation","Image edge detection","Layout","Image sensors","Vehicles","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","computerised navigation","computerised picture processing","position control","road vehicles","robots","transport computer control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unexplored regions","occluded regions","traversable regions","obstacle avoidance","computer vision","mobile robot","sensory data","3D world model","sensor map","local map","global map","range image","height map","obstacle regions","obstacle detection","path planning","artificial objects","natural objects","video image","segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","displayDocTitle":"Building a 3D world model for mobile robot from sensory data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","accessionNumber":"3228076","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building a 3D world model for mobile robot from sensory data","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045073S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"9","articleId":"12177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":12217,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

Without compensating for lens distortion, accuracy achieved for locating intruders is between 1/60 to 1/100 of depth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12272","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012272.pdf","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1465 vol.3","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00012272.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vision system for safe robot operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=12272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12272/","displayDocTitle":"A vision system for safe robot operation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3228138","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vision system for safe robot operation","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012272.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045955S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"4","articleId":"12272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":12280,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The onboard navigation system comprises a reference-state generator, an error-feedback controller, and cart-location sensing using odometry. There is a convenient separation between the path guidance and control logic. Under normal operating conditions, the controller ensures that the errors between the measured and reference states are small. These errors only exceed set limits if the cart is malfunctioning. Major hardware failures can be detected in this way and failsafe procedures invoked. Results on the control system performance derived from a computer simulation of the cart and its operating environment, and from an experimental cart, indicate that the system can provide reliable, accurate, and safe operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12280","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","startPage":"1504","endPage":"1510 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local path control for an autonomous vehicle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=12280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Local path control for an autonomous vehicle","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12280/","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3228145","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local path control for an autonomous vehicle","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029869S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"61","articleId":"12280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":12291,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is O(m/sup 3/n/sup 3/ log mn), which is close to optimal. FP is a three-dimensional curved object which can be used to find free motions within the same time bounds. Two types of motion have been studied in some detail. Motion in contact, where I remains in contact with E, is performed by moving along the faces of the boundary of FP. By partitioning FP into prisms, it is possible to compute motions when I never makes contact with E. In this case, the theoretical complexity does not exceed O(m/sup 6/n/sup 6/ alpha (mn)) but it is expected to be much smaller in practice. In both cases, pseudo-optimal motions can be obtained with a complexity increased by a factor log mn.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12304","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1988 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/202/541/00012304.pdf","startPage":"1656","endPage":"1661 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1988.12304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical exact motion planning algorithm for polygonal objects amidst polygonal obstacles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=12304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12304/","displayDocTitle":"A practical exact motion planning algorithm for polygonal objects amidst polygonal obstacles","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3247407","conferenceDate":"24-29 April 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical exact motion planning algorithm for polygonal objects amidst polygonal obstacles","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068032S","chronDate":"24-29 Apr 1988","isNumber":"541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"202","citationCount":"75","articleId":"12304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":12323,"authors":[{"name":"P.

When the owner of a workstation resumes activity at a station, Condor checkpoints the remote job running on the station and transfers it to another workstation.

The power dissipation of the preamplifier is 13 mW. The amplifying elements are single-sided gate JFETs developed for this application.

The procedure for subtracting accidental coincidences from the data stream generated by this physical phantom is such that the resultant data are not Poisson distributed. This makes the present investigation different from other investigations based on computer-simulated phantoms. It is shown that the MLE algorithm is robust enough to yield comparatively good images, especially when the phantom is in the periphery of the field of view, even though the underlying assumption of the algorithm is violated. A stopping rule derived earlier and allowing the user to stop the iterative process before the images begin to deteriorate is tested. Since the rule is based on the Poisson assumption, it does not work well with the presently available data, although it is successful with computer-simulated Poisson data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.12795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"603","endPage":"607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.12795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=545","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/545/00012795.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Imaging phantoms","Monte Carlo methods","Image reconstruction","Detectors","Positron emission tomography","Testing","Iterative algorithms","Laboratories","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","computerised tomography","Monte Carlo methods","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLE reconstruction","brain phantom","Monte Carlo transition matrix","statistical stopping rule","maximum-likelihood-estimator","positron-emission tomography","PET","ECAT-III tomograph","subtracting accidental coincidences","stopping rule"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MLE reconstruction of a brain phantom using a Monte Carlo transition matrix and a statistical stopping rule","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12795/","volume":"35","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3212340","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MLE reconstruction of a brain phantom using a Monte Carlo transition matrix and a statistical stopping rule","sourcePdf":"00012795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044042S","chronDate":"Feb.  1988","isNumber":"545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"73","articleId":"12795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":12799,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

Its detector consists of a single-crystal NaI(Tl) ring (31-cm ID by 8-mm thick by 13-cm wide) coupled through an annular light pipe to a 21*3 array of 51-mm/sup 2/ photomultipliers. A unique multifield collimator system, consisting of set of six parallel-hole collimators oriented in an annular array, is designed to view the patient's head from six angles simultaneously. This ring is rotated with high precision, concentric to the detector, through 2 pi radians to sample gamma-ray emissions for 3-D reconstruction over a 23-cm*9-cm field of view. Preliminary results indicate that central regions of the brain will be detected with an efficiency of about six times that of a conventional rotating parallel-hole camera SPECT system and an effective inherent transverse resolution of within 3.5 mm. The system is designed to achieve a reconstructed resolution FWHM within 7.5 mm at the center of the image field. It also features unique means for digital position analysis, calibration, and user quality control. With ASPECT's precision rotating collimator, artifacts normally associated with detector motion, nonuniform sensitivity, and spatial nonlinearities are expected to be insignificant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.12806","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"654","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/545/00012806.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00012806.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.12806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The development of ASPECT, an annular single crystal brain camera for high efficiency SPECT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collimators","Computed tomography","Digital cameras","Brain","Optical coupling","Optical arrays","Sensor arrays","Photomultipliers","Head","Gamma ray detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASPECT","annular single crystal brain camera","high efficiency SPECT","single-photon-emission computed tomography","3-D brain imaging","single-crystal NaI(Tl) ring","unique multifield collimator system","parallel-hole collimators","transverse resolution","detector motion","nonuniform sensitivity","spatial nonlinearities","NaI:Tl"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1988","displayDocTitle":"The development of ASPECT, an annular single crystal brain camera for high efficiency SPECT","volume":"35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","accessionNumber":"3212351","publicationDate":"Feb. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12806/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The development of ASPECT, an annular single crystal brain camera for high efficiency SPECT","sourcePdf":"00012806.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055458S","chronDate":"Feb.  1988","isNumber":"545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"60","articleId":"12806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":12807,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

The design is based on a quad scintillator dual-channel detector module using two avalanche photodiodes as photodetectors. Original features include bilayered scintillators to measure the depth of interaction, tilted detectors relative to the radial direction to ensure proper sampling in a stationary mode, multiring capability, and an independent acquisition channel for every discrete detector. Significantly better resolution is obtained toward the edges of the camera field, and the sampling uniformity near the center is improved. Multiring systems with a slice thickness of 5 mm can be implemented to achieve true volume imaging with symmetrical 3-D spatial resolution. The performance of the proposed design is analyzed in terms of resolution, sensitivity, contrast, and field uniformity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1988","volume":"35","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3212357","publicationDate":"Feb. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of a high resolution positron emission tomograph using solid state scintillation detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a high resolution positron emission tomograph using solid state scintillation detectors","sourcePdf":"00012812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052113S","chronDate":"Feb.  1988","isNumber":"545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"67","articleId":"12812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":12815,"authors":[{"name":"L.

They report on one such combination, consisting of thin-wall glass microspheres filled with high-pressure /sup 3/He gas dispersed in plastic scintillation. They have developed glass formulations that are capable of containing the helium in shells with wall thickness as low as 1 mu m with leak rates at room temperature that correspond to several years half life. The energy loss of the reaction products in the shell wall and the low light yield of plastic scintillations for low-energy protons result in low light yield per event. The authors discuss the use of an optical modeling code to investigate the incorporation of wavelength-shifting elements to aid in the collection of this light from highly scattering composite scintillation media.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.12850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/545/00012850.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.12850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=545","startPage":"872","endPage":"875","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00012850.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light collection in scintillation detector composites for neutron detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=12850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Light collection in scintillation detector composites for neutron detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12850/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1988","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1988","accessionNumber":"3212394","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light collection in scintillation detector composites for neutron detection","sourcePdf":"00012850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029242S","chronDate":"Feb.  1988","isNumber":"545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"178","articleId":"12850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":12877,"authors":[{"name":"E.

To get reliable and full assessment of ATD, the model is made up of a switch, a concentrator, two home networks, and terminals. The project started in 1982 and was completed in the middle of 1987. The success of the experiment proves the feasibility of ATD, which is now agreed on as a possible solution for future ISDN (integrated-services digital network) use. The authors address the results derived from the experiment and analyze the trends that can be expected for the future. First, an outline of Prelude is given to describe the state of the arc reached within the experiment. Each element of the system is described with special emphasis on the switching matrix, as its optimized and efficient implementation could lead to short-term industrial developments. Then a thorough assessment of the whole system is given from which future evolutions are most likely to be derived. Possible ATD fields of application are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.12880","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/546/00012880.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00012880.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.12880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 'Prelude' ATD experiment: assessments and future prospects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Throughput","Packet switching","Switches","Home automation","ISDN","Lead","Europe","Switching circuits","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","ISDN","line concentrators","multiplexing equipment","packet switching","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","broadband networks","TDM","Prelude experimental model","asynchronous time-division","switch","concentrator","home networks","terminals","ISDN","switching matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","displayDocTitle":"The 'Prelude' ATD experiment: assessments and future prospects","volume":"6","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3330772","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12880/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 'Prelude' ATD experiment: assessments and future prospects","sourcePdf":"00012880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058766S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"73","articleId":"12880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":12886,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

They are (1) input queuing, where a separate buffer is provided at each input to the switch; (2) input smoothing, where a frame of b packets is stored at each of the input line to the switch and simultaneously launched into a switch fabric of size Nb*Nb; (3) output queuing, where packets are queued in a separate first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer located at each output of the switch; and (4) completely shared buffering, where all queuing is done at the outputs and all buffers are completely shared among all the output lines. Input queues saturate at an offered load that depends on the service policy and the number of inputs N, but is approximately 0.586 with FIFO buffers when N is large. Output queuing and completely shared buffering both achieve the optimal throughput-delay performance for any packet switch. However, compared to output queuing, completely shared buffering requires less buffer memory at the expense of an increase in switch fabric size.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.12886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.12886","endPage":"1597","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00012886.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/546/00012886.pdf","startPage":"1587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queueing in high-performance packet switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12886/","displayDocTitle":"Queueing in high-performance packet switching","volume":"6","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"3330777","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queueing in high-performance packet switching","sourcePdf":"00012886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026797S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"593","articleId":"12886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":12887,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

As opposed to multiaccess protocols of existing fiber-optic systems, in the proposed approach the outgoing channel of the source node and the incoming channel of the destination node are allocated time-sequentially, creating a time-dependent virtual path for all pairs of users. Using the time-oriented path allocation, the need for packet buffering at the central node is eliminated multiple channels can be utilized simultaneously for different transmissions, and packet delays are bounded. The authors demonstrate that the same approach is feasible for efficient control of multibeam satellite systems. They introduce a tractable analytic model for the evaluation of communication systems based on this approach. The model is used to evaluate the proposed system performance under different switching functionalities of the central node. In addition to providing the throughput/delay characteristics of the system, the model shows a relation between the degree of star symmetry and the system performance, with the equidistant node arrangement yielding the optimal performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/12896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 March 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3197724","conferenceDate":"27-31 March 1988","displayDocTitle":"Path allocation access control in fiber optic communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path allocation access control in fiber optic communication systems","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00012896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042139S","chronDate":"27-31 March 1988","isNumber":"547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"192","citationCount":"4","articleId":"12896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":12899,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

Unlike previously described optical network structures, these networks allow the reuse of wavelengths in different transmission sections and this leads to fewer wavelengths being needed. A choice of structures using a common set of components leads to the opportunity to design a network according to the geographical distribution of the switching nodes. The structures provide for a set of point-to-point interconnections and, with modest numbers of wavelengths, full interconnection between the optoelectronic nodes is possible at the optical level. In bypassing intermediate electronic stages the networks appear to offer good reliability characteristics. Providing the components in an initial network are designed to utilize bandwidth efficiently, the networks could be upgraded to incorporate more channels, optical switching, and other forms of optical processing at the optical nodes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1988.12937","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '88,Seventh Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communcations Societies.

They construct a model that allows them to derive steady-state results and that makes into consideration system parameters such as number of receivers, propagation delay, and error probabilities of packets and acknowledgements.

A four-level symbol set is shown to be able to defeat quadratic and fourth-power circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1988.13428","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 88, 21st Century Military Communications - What's Possible?'.

The processor uses state-of-the-art algorithms as well as the latest high-speed CMOS VLSI technology to achieve a processing rate in excess of 10 gigamultiply/adds per second. The system exhibits several unique features; in particular, 40 Mband signals can be processed with 64-tap equalizer and the functions of baud and carrier recovery are implemented digitally. The signal processing problems to be solved are described, and from them a set of requirements is developed. A summary of the algorithms needed to recover symbol timing, equalize the incoming signals, and remove carrier offset is provided.

The network requirements and system architecture aspects are reviewed, the relevant access and synchronization techniques are outlined, and the processor structure and operation are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","pdfPath":"/iel4/720/553/00013620.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"525 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1988.13620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1988.13620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=13620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiservice on-board switching for mobile satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication switching","Satellite communication","Satellite broadcasting","ISDN","Laboratories","Prototypes","Circuit testing","Artificial satellites","Mobile communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio systems","satellite relay systems","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["onboard processing","access techniques","multiservice onboard switching","mobile satellite communications","network requirements","system architecture","synchronization techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"Multiservice on-board switching for mobile satellite communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3296128","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiservice on-board switching for mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028266S","chronDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","isNumber":"553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"720","citationCount":"2","articleId":"13620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":13622,"authors":[{"name":"I.D.

This protocol uses reserved slot headers for transmission reservation in addition to ALOHA slots for retransmission reservation.

A control parameter f is used to control the packet transmission rates adaptively so that the delay is always minimum for a given throughput. Two versions of the protocol (fixed frame and dynamic frame) are analyzed. C-SMRA gives an average delay smaller than slotted ALOHA even when the throughput is as low as 0.05. Under heavy traffic condition, C-SRMA can provide a throughput close to unity with a minimum amount of minislot overhead and average delay not much more than one round-trip propagation delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1988.13672","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","pdfPath":"/iel4/720/553/00013672.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"818 vol.2","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00013672.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1988.13672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The controlled-SRMA protocol for packet satellite communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=13672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13672/","displayDocTitle":"The controlled-SRMA protocol for packet satellite communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3296152","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The controlled-SRMA protocol for packet satellite communication","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073753S","chronDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","isNumber":"553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"720","citationCount":"2","articleId":"13672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":13673,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

This protocol is particularly suitable for a satellite system serving an area with a dense population of Earth stations. By incorporating a narrowband ground radio channel for broadcasting busy tones, the Earth stations are able to avoid packet collisions by sensing the absence of busy tones before transmitting packets, and partial collision detection capability can also be achieved. The performance of TSMA/PCD is found to be somewhere between CSMA (carrier-sense multiaccess) and CSMA/CD, depending on the number N of busy tones used. When N=50, single-tone TSMA/PCD gives almost identical performance as CSMA/CD, while for multitone and slot-by-slot announcement TSMA/PCD protocols, only N=8 and N=2, respectively, are sufficient to drive the system to the CSMA/CD performance. Both nonpersistent and 1-persistent TSMA/PCD give lower delays than their corresponding CSMA protocols. The performance of the protocols in a noisy satellite channel is also studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1988.13673","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","pdfPath":"/iel4/720/553/00013673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1988.13673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=553","startPage":"819","endPage":"825 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The tone sense multiaccess protocol with partial collision detection (TSMA/PCD) for packet satellite communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=13673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The tone sense multiaccess protocol with partial collision detection (TSMA/PCD) for packet satellite communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13673/","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3296153","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The tone sense multiaccess protocol with partial collision detection (TSMA/PCD) for packet satellite communication","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013673.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041994S","chronDate":"12-15 June 1988","isNumber":"553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"720","citationCount":"1","articleId":"13673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":13701,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Extensions to coherent M-QAM and higher-order PSK system are indicated, and an application to a 16-QAM system is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1988.13784","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","pdfPath":"/iel4/720/553/00013784.pdf","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1432 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1988.13784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the McGee upper bound to coherent M-PSK and M-QAM error probabilities in the presence of multitone co- and inter-channel interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=13784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13784/","displayDocTitle":"Application of the McGee upper bound to coherent M-PSK and M-QAM error probabilities in the presence of multitone co- and inter-channel interference","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3296238","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the McGee upper bound to coherent M-PSK and M-QAM error probabilities in the presence of multitone co- and inter-channel interference","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037455S","chronDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","isNumber":"553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"720","articleId":"13784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":13785,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The results obtained by computer simulation show that a combination of moderate output backoff from saturation of the HPA and prerotation of the transmitted signal constellation can considerably improve the system performance. The performance of the proposed system is compared to that of a 16-ary DEQAM system using an RF predistorter. The results show that the degradation due to the AM-AM and AM-PM conversion effects of the HPA tested is much less than that of the sum of the degradations caused by the individual AM-AM and AM-PM conversion effects. Also, the AM-AM signal distortion causes more degradation than does the AM-PM signal distortion, under the same assumed conditions. With pre-rotation and moderate output backoff values of the HPA, the AM-PM distortion in the received signal-space vectors can nearly be eliminated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","pdfPath":"/iel4/720/553/00013836.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1708 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1988.13836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1988.13836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=13836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of 16-ary DEQAM signalling with a pre-rotated constellation through nonlinear satellite channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Distortion","Differential amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Amplitude modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Additive white noise","Computer simulation","Constellation diagram","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","satellite relay systems","signalling (telecommunication networks)","telecommunication channels","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear satellite channels","bandlimited 16-ary differentially encoded quadrature amplitude modulated","additive white Gaussian noise","computer simulation","signal constellation","system performance","RF predistorter","signal distortion","pre-rotation","signal-space vectors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"Performance of 16-ary DEQAM signalling with a pre-rotated constellation through nonlinear satellite channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3277102","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of 16-ary DEQAM signalling with a pre-rotated constellation through nonlinear satellite channels","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027005S","chronDate":"12-15 June 1988","isNumber":"553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"720","citationCount":"2","articleId":"13836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":13837,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Three types of HPAs, such as the Hughes TWTA (traveling-wave-tube amplifier), Siemens linearized TWTA, and Fujitsu linearized GaAs FET, are considered. A baseband signal mapping technique is proposed which compensates for system impairments caused by AM/AM and AM/PM nonlinearities of HPAs. The suboptimally mapped 16-QAM used enables the HPAs to operate close to saturation at significantly reduced CNR (carrier-to-noise ratio) degradation. In conjunction with a novel signal constellation at the transmitter, an adaptive-decision threshold detector is applied at the receiver to improve the system performance. As an illustrative result, the CNR degradation of the proposed system operating at 0.9 dB OBO (output backoff) of Siemens TWTA is 1.9 dB at P(e)=10/sup -6/. This corresponds to 7 dB or even higher CNR improvement compared to a conventional 16-QAM system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","pdfPath":"/iel4/720/553/00013837.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1713 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, - Spanning the Universe.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1988.13837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1988.13837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=13837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal mapping optimization of 16-QAM for non-linear mode operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal mapping","Degradation","High power amplifiers","Performance analysis","Gallium arsenide","FETs","Baseband","Constellation diagram","Transmitters","Adaptive signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","field effect transistors","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","optimisation","power amplifiers","signal processing","travelling-wave-tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal mapping optimisation","16-QAM systems","nonlinear mode","high-power amplifiers","Hughes","traveling-wave-tube amplifier","Siemens","Fujitsu","FET","baseband signal mapping","system impairments","signal constellation","transmitter","adaptive-decision threshold detector","receiver","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"Signal mapping optimization of 16-QAM for non-linear mode operation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3277103","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal mapping optimization of 16-QAM for non-linear mode operation","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043857S","chronDate":"12-15 June 1988","isNumber":"553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"720","citationCount":"2","articleId":"13837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":13886,"authors":[{"name":"F.Y.

These waveforms demonstrate that low-noise, high-bandwidth preamplifiers are needed in order to observe the shape of prebreakdown current pulses, including the earliest pulses which are extremely small and fast. These and other factors influencing the design of an improved preamplifier are considered. Data collected indicate that at least a 50-MHz bandwidth is desirable to see the higher frequency components of the current pulses and that the noise level should be as low as possible so very small currents will be detectable. A major constraint on the design is the need to protect the preamplifier from a complete breakdown of the test sample while still maintaining bandwidth and noise performance. Another important consideration is the tradeoff between bandwidth and noise level. In general an increased bandwidth implies higher noise levels and, hence, higher minimum detectable currents. In light of these considerations, the relative merits of current-sensitive (transimpedance) preamplifiers and voltage-sensitive preamplifiers (where current develops a voltage across the input impedance) are examined, and the possibility of greater current sensitivity is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELINSL.1988.13946","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1988 IEEE International Symposium on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel2/746/554/00013946.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"386","doi":"10.1109/ELINSL.1988.13946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-noise, high-bandwidth amplification of prebreakdown current pulses in liquid dielectrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"Low-noise, high-bandwidth amplification of prebreakdown current pulses in liquid dielectrics","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3278104","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/13946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-noise, high-bandwidth amplification of prebreakdown current pulses in liquid dielectrics","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00013946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035777S","chronDate":"5-8 Jun 1988","isNumber":"554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"746","citationCount":"4","articleId":"13946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":14077,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

To characterize shielding performance, possible sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI), such as radiated EMI, conducted EMI, grounding, electrostatic discharge and environmental effects, along with their corresponding distances (near- or far-field) to the equipment under test (EUT), are examined. The analysis considers only the penetration of the magnetic field through the walls and apertures, since the electric field attenuation is high when a good conducting material is used for the shield. A finite-element method that is based on a magnetic vector-potential formulation is used; it can be applied to calculate the shielding effectiveness of any arbitrary selected enclosure.

The gain medium inside an unstable cavity is represented by a folded pulsed amplifier which is seeded by a narrowband input signal. A set of coupled rate equations for the population densities of the upper laser states, the wideband absorbers, and the photon flux was numerically integrated. Measured gain and absorption of the amplifier were used as input data to evaluate the model. Excellent agreement between calculated and experimentally observed peak intensity and various other pulse characteristics such as peak shape and laser pulse delay time was obtained. This model also predicts the experimentally determined injection-control threshold for KrF excimer lasers successfully, and should be applicable to numerous other injection seeded lasers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.14377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/561/00014377.pdf","startPage":"2458","endPage":"2466","doi":"10.1109/3.14377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical model for injection-controlled excimer laser amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Analytical model for injection-controlled excimer laser amplifiers","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3332283","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical model for injection-controlled excimer laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00014377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040036S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"9","articleId":"14377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":14396,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The problems are analyzed by solving their corresponding electric-field integral equation. The procedure is made easy and systematic by using a sampling process with rooftop functions to represent the induced current and pulses to average the fields. These functions have been widely used in moment-method (MM) applications. The scheme is an efficient numerical tool, benefiting from the good convergence and low memory requirements of the CG and the low CPU time consumed in performing convolutions with the FFT. In comparison with the MM, the scheme avoids the storage of large matrices and reduces the computer time by an order of magnitude.

An important extension of the Mizusawa-Kitsuregawa criteria was discovered (M.M. Zusama and T. Kitsuregawa, ibid., vol.AP-21, pp.844-8, Nov. 1973). The principle revealed shows how a two-reflector cell, although in itself distorting, may be combined with a second cell which compensates for the first and delivers an output beam which is a good image of the input beam.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.14400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.14400","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1787","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/562/00014400.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for beamwaveguide in the NASA Deep Space Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for beamwaveguide in the NASA Deep Space Network","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"36","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3331970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14400/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for beamwaveguide in the NASA Deep Space Network","sourcePdf":"00014400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026102S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","articleId":"14400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":14401,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A local control strategy that governs the manipulator is a law that assigns an infinitesimal change in the joint angles so that the hand will move infinitesimally in the direction designated by the path. Because of the redundancy, there can be many such control strategies. For some strategies it turns out that when the hand returns to its initial position, the joint angles do not always return to their initial values. To determine a priori whether a given local control strategy guarantees repeatability or not, it is necessary to deduce its global properties as well as its local properties. This is achieved by considering integral surfaces for a distribution in the joint space.

A simple method for sampling rate selection based on control bandwidths is proposed. Methods for generating a discrete-time state model of a sampled-data plant and a discrete-time equivalent to an analog cost function for a sampled-data plant are described. The successive loop closures and linear quadratic Gaussian synthesis methods are reviewed, and a constrained optimization synthesis method is introduced. The proposed sampling rate selection, discretization, and synthesis methods are applied to two example design problems. Multirate and single-rate compensators synthesized by the different methods are compared based on closed-loop responses with compensators having the same real-time computation load.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.14436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=564","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/564/00014436.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate digital control system design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multirate digital control system design","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3322489","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate digital control system design","sourcePdf":"00014436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053016S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"147","articleId":"14436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":14448,"authors":[{"name":"C.B.

For PLLs with digital inputs and outputs, however, a discrete-time z-domain model more accurately describes loop behavior. In this study, a methodology is described for obtaining an accurate z-domain description of a discrete-time PLL. The modeling technique transforms portions of the s-domain PLL model directly into the z-domain, requiring only straightforward algebraic manipulations even for complex loop filters. This methodology is demonstrated for a simple loop filter, and measurements from the digital signaling interface integrated circuit are used to compare s-domain, z-domain, and time-step analysis results for a more complicated loop filter. The z-domain model, although only incrementally more complicated than the s-domain model, is shown to be more accurate, especially at higher jitter frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.14463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/31/565/00014463.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1400","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00014463.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.14463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"z-domain model for discrete-time PLL's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","displayDocTitle":"z-domain model for discrete-time PLL's","volume":"35","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3332471","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"z-domain model for discrete-time PLL's","sourcePdf":"00014463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074518S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"94","articleId":"14463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":14464,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

Coincidence timing resolution of a pair of array detectors was 6.1 ns FWHM and 11.3 ns FWTM. Energy resolution per individual crystal ranged from 16.8 to 24.1% FWHM at 511 keV for an amplitude variation of a factor of 2.8. The signals from the photomultipliers were summed pairwise, the pairs in each dimension subtracted, and the differences divided by the amplitude of the signal summed from all four photomultipliers. The resulting two-pulse-height spectra contained peaks corresponding to the row or column containing the detector of interaction. Six conditions of detector identification were tested. The correct identification of detector ranged from 76% to 87% of the events.

Two-dimensional convolutions required for forming the estimate are converted into a series of one-dimensional convolutions that can be evaluated in parallel. Each one-dimensional convolution is evaluated using a number-theoretic transform. All numerical calculations are performed using finite-field arithmetic. To avoid the use of large finite fields and to increase parallelism, each convolution is performed by a series of convolutions with small digits in a Galois field. The hardware architecture allows a two-dimensional convolution of dimension N*N to be formed with O(N) operations, permitting one iteration of the expectation-maximization algorithm to be formed in approximately 100 ms when N=128 and the number of view angles is 32.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.14510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/568/00014510.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.14510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware architecture using finite-field arithmetic for computing maximum-likelihood estimates in emission tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=14510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14510/","displayDocTitle":"A hardware architecture using finite-field arithmetic for computing maximum-likelihood estimates in emission tomography","volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3321499","pubMedId":"18230480","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware architecture using finite-field arithmetic for computing maximum-likelihood estimates in emission tomography","sourcePdf":"00014510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114181S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"7","articleId":"14510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":14513,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

This algorithm is based on sequential tree searching of possible coronary artery boundary locations. Using a coronary artery phantom, the authors compared the results obtained using SEL with hand-traced boundaries. Using a magnification of 2*, the results are generally good, with the average error being 1.7% of the diameter. Actual coronary artery images were also processed and a similar comparison indicated that total areas were comparable but the hand-drawn stenoses were, on average, 7% greater than the unobstructed diameter.

Reversible data compression involves two consecutive steps: decorrelation and coding. The result of the decorrelation step is presented in terms of entropy.

It appears that a hierarchical decorrelation method based on interpolation (HINT) outperforms all other methods considered.

Results show that some utilities utilizing battery storage for peak load shaving might benefit from use of photovoltaic (PV) power, the extent of its usefulness being dependent on the specific load shapes as well as the photovoltaic array orientations. Typical utility load shapes both in the eastern (at Rayleigh, NC) and in the western (at Hesperia, CA) parts of the USA are examined for this purpose. It is concluded that while photovoltaic power generation seems to present a bigger impact on the load of the western utility, both utilities will experience considerable savings on the size of the battery system required to shave the peak loads as well as in the night-time base capacity required to charge the battery.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1988","accessionNumber":"3333917","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of interrelationships between photovoltaic power and battery storage for electric utility load management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of interrelationships between photovoltaic power and battery storage for electric utility load management","sourcePdf":"00014539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031914S","chronDate":"Aug.  1988","isNumber":"569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"30","articleId":"14539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":14540,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The method proposed by the authors groups the units into several subsystems. One subsystem contains the conventional units and the remaining subsystem consist of unconventional units. A generation system model is built for each subsystem. The outputs for the unconventional units and the load are treated as correlated random variables. Using a clustering procedure states are identified wherein for a given value of load there are specific mean values of the outputs of the unconventional units.

As part of a larger effort to develop a large simulation to evaluate performance of various management strategies, they have created a simple, realistic, easily implementable model for the temperature of a house having a heater/air-conditioner which is regulated by a thermostat and operates in an environment that contains random elements. Two models previously given in the literature are reviewed before giving the details of the model, the feature of which is that it is a stochastic model operating in discrete time. Computer results show good agreement with basic physical principles, and suggest that the probability distributions of on-time and off-time are negative binomial. It is concluded that this model will provide a useful tool in the evaluation of load-management strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Heating","Cooling","Thermal management","Thermostats","Computational modeling","Environmental management","Temperature","Distributed computing","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","electric heating","load management","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic computer model","heating","cooling loads","demand-side management","thermostats","heater","air-conditioner","probability distributions","negative binomial","load-management strategies"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.14584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/569/00014584.pdf","startPage":"1213","endPage":"1219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.14584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic computer model for heating and cooling loads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=14584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic computer model for heating and cooling loads","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14584/","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1988","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3333961","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic computer model for heating and cooling loads","sourcePdf":"00014584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03259S","chronDate":"Aug.  1988","isNumber":"569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"114","articleId":"14584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":14585,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

It offers a very fast and reliable algorithm where accuracy and speed are traded, depending on the severity of overload. For overloads greatly in excess of short-time ratings, the speed of removing the overloads within the specified time is given higher priority than the accurate minimization of load curtailments. To provide positive and reliable collective action, overloads are overcorrected by shedding more loads than is absolutely necessary, since the excess loads shed can subsequently be restored by partial restoration. The local shedding scheme has been tested by simulation at the Potomac Electric Power Company for a number of single and multiple outages in the 138 kV underground transmission network with good results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.14585","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00014585.png","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/569/00014585.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.14585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local band shedding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Substations","Voltage control","Load flow","Time measurement","Combustion","Turbines","Delay","Electrical equipment industry","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load shedding","underground transmission systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local-load-shedding","equipment overloads","underground transmission networks","short-time ratings","load curtailments","Potomac Electric Power Company","138 kV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Local band shedding","volume":"3","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3333962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local band shedding","sourcePdf":"00014585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038191S","chronDate":"Aug.  1988","isNumber":"569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"19","articleId":"14585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":14587,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By modeling the high-frequency leakage field and conductor eddy currents the major sources of internal damping are included. The impedance matrix can be integrated for conventional transient analysis programs based on an equivalent-circuit approach. A substructuring technique in combination with the highly regular winding geometry is used to reduce computational requirements in the finite-element solution. The method is verified by comparison with measurements. Damping causes a shift of resonant frequencies and determines resonant amplitudes.

This research differs from other synthesizers by implementing testability as part of the VLSI design solution. A binary tree data structure is used throughout the testable design search. Its bottom-up and top-down tree algorithms provide datapath allocation, constraint estimation, and feedback for design exploration. The partitioning and two-dimensional characteristics of the binary tree structure provide VLSI design floorplans and global information for test incorporation. An elliptical wave filter example has been used to illustrate the design synthesis with testability constraints methodology. Test methodologies such as multiple chain scan paths and BIST (built-in-self-testing) with different test schedules have been explored.

The processor addresses a variety of problems ranging from timing simulation to circuit simulation. The accelerator combines special purpose units, such as a high-speed device evaluator, with a fully programmable general-purpose processor. The specialized processors offer extremely high speed for performance-critical parts of the simulation. The general-purpose processors are optimized for compiled electrical simulation, and use a very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture. The network solution is compiled into VLIW code. The author concentrates on those features of the machine that are designed for circuit simulation algorithms, such as SPICE. A simplified example is used to expose the hardware and software techniques used to attack the problem, and estimate the performance improvement due to each technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257819","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"A programmable hardware accelerator for compiled electrical simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A programmable hardware accelerator for compiled electrical simulation","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00014754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046667S","chronDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","isNumber":"572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"207","citationCount":"3","articleId":"14754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":14757,"authors":[{"name":"J.

LocusRoute is meant to be used as the cost function for a placement algorithm, and so this context constrains the structure of the global routing algorithm and its parallel implementation. The router is based on enumerating a subset of all two-bend routes between two points, and results in 16% to 37% fewer total number of tracks than the Timber Wolf global router for standard cells. It is comparable in quality to a maze router and an industrial router, but is ten times or more faster. Three approaches to parallelizing the router are implemented: wire-by-wire parallelism, segment-by-segment and route-by-route. Two of these approaches achieve significant speedup; route-by-route achieves up to 4.6 using eight processors, and wire-by-wire achieves from 5.8 to 7.6 on eight processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1988.14757","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00014757.png","publicationTitle":"25th ACM/IEEE, Design Automation Conference.Proceedings 1988.","displayPublicationTitle":"25th ACM/IEEE, Design Automation Conference.Proceedings 1988.","pdfPath":"/iel2/207/572/00014757.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1988.14757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LocusRoute: a parallel global router for standard cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"LocusRoute: a parallel global router for standard cells","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3257822","publicationDate":"1988","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LocusRoute: a parallel global router for standard cells","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00014757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025305S","chronDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","isNumber":"572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"207","citationCount":"34","articleId":"14757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":14764,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The underlying design process model is explained showing the intermediate stages, while emphasizing high-level issues. First, the principles of operations are translated manually into high-level behavioral descriptions.

Structural synthesis automatically generates a circuit structure for each pipeline stage, including the control and the data path. The combinational logic is optimized globally during logic synthesis producing a multilevel implementation. The resulting size (in number of transistors) and the performance of the processor (estimated cycle time and cycles per instruction) are compared to a manual RT-level design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1988.14804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1988.14804","publicationTitle":"25th ACM/IEEE, Design Automation Conference.Proceedings 1988.","displayPublicationTitle":"25th ACM/IEEE, Design Automation Conference.Proceedings 1988.","pdfPath":"/iel2/207/572/00014804.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"494","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00014804.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design process model in the Yorktown silicon compiler","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","displayDocTitle":"Design process model in the Yorktown silicon compiler","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257843","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design process model in the Yorktown silicon compiler","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00014804.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060663S","chronDate":"12-15 Jun 1988","isNumber":"572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"207","citationCount":"15","articleId":"14804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":14811,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The Irouter is a flexible tool intended to be useful wherever tight or unusual constraints do not permit automatic routing. It has already been used in the layout of an 80000-transistor CMOS chip and is currently being used to route the control signals of a 100000 transistor, high-performance FPU (floating-point unit) chip. Several novel ideas for maze routing have been developed in the Irouter. Hint layers permit the user to map out the general path of a route and pull the route in desired directions, while leaving details to the router. The gross structure of the layout is preprocessed to facilitate accurate estimates of cost to completion during routing and hence effective pruning of misdirected partial routes. A windowed search strategy slowly shifts the focus from the start point towards the goal. This permits the consideration of alternatives at all stages of routing without blowing up into an exhaustive search.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interactive maze router with hints","publicationTitle":"25th ACM/IEEE, Design Automation Conference.Proceedings 1988.","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1988.14840","displayPublicationTitle":"25th ACM/IEEE, Design Automation Conference.Proceedings 1988.","pdfPath":"/iel2/207/572/00014840.pdf","startPage":"672","endPage":"676","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00014840.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1988.14840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=14840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"An interactive maze router with hints","conferenceDate":"12-15 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3257879","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interactive maze router with hints","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00014840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043823S","chronDate":"12-15 June 1988","isNumber":"572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"207","citationCount":"16","articleId":"14840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":14842,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Thus, once synchronization has occurred, good control action in the vicinity of the synchronization point is achieved. However, for higher-level QAM signals the synchronization process is not perfect. The author proposes a method in which the information contained in the amplitude and the relative phase position of the sampled signal values is used to calculate the most probable phase deviation of the local carrier signal in relation to the transmitted carrier signal. This provides better acquisition characteristics without impairing the good tracking characteristics obtained with other methods. Computer simulations suggest that relatively quick and secure synchronization will be achieved with higher-level QAM systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1988.14997","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/706/573/00014997.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1988.14997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=573","startPage":"599","endPage":"602 vol.1","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00014997.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new carrier regeneration scheme for QAM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=14997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new carrier regeneration scheme for QAM signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/14997/","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3317052","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new carrier regeneration scheme for QAM signals","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"00014997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030552S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1988","isNumber":"573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"706","citationCount":"1","articleId":"14997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":15000,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The RDFT-based filtering gives better performance in terms of spatial resolution, intermediate noise, and signal discrimination than the DFT-based filtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15109","pdfPath":"/iel2/706/573/00015109.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1070 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00015109.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear matched filtering and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/15109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear matched filtering and neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3327107","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear matched filtering and neural networks","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"00015109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062188S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1988","isNumber":"573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"706","citationCount":"3","articleId":"15109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":15114,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The proposed system has been simulated and compared on the basis of signal/noise ratio (SNR). Five types of input signals have been used including Gaussian-type signals, harmonic-type signals, and digitized speech. With four different sampling rates (8, 12, 16, and 24 kHz), one can improve the SNR by 4-5 dB or reduce the transmission rate significantly.

A fifth-order lowpass filter is taken as an example, showing the increased performance with this structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15208","startPage":"1473","endPage":"1477 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1988 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/706/573/00015208.pdf","publicationTitle":"1988 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=573","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00015208.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SC-filter structures with reduced requirements on op-amp bandwidth and settling time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"SC-filter structures with reduced requirements on op-amp bandwidth and settling time","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1988","publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3317119","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/15208/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SC-filter structures with reduced requirements on op-amp bandwidth and settling time","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"00015208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026045S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1988","isNumber":"573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"706","articleId":"15208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":15213,"authors":[{"name":"S.-J.

These decimators contain no general multipliers and very few data memory locations, thereby making them easily realizable in CMOS VLSI. This is achieved by using several decimation stages, with each stage containing a small number of delays and arithmetic operations. The output sampling rate of these decimators is the minimum possible one, and the proposed decimators can be used, with very slight changes, for many oversampling ratios. Furthermore, these decimators highly attenuate the undesired out-of-band signal components of the input signal, thus significantly relaxing the antialiasing prefilter requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15220","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00015220.png","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/706/573/00015220.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1528 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI-realizable decimators for sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1988","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI-realizable decimators for sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1988","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3327148","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/15220/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI-realizable decimators for sigma-delta analog-to-digital converters","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"00015220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036584S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1988","isNumber":"573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"706","citationCount":"29","articleId":"15220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":15229,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Some considerations are given with respect to the complexity of implementation; however, a more detailed analysis would require actual VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15497","publicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1988., IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/706/573/00015497.pdf","startPage":"2703","endPage":"2706 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1988.15497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of fast angle calculation and rotation using on-line CORDIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of fast angle calculation and rotation using on-line CORDIC","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3329102","publicationDate":"1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/15497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 1988","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of fast angle calculation and rotation using on-line CORDIC","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"00015497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053649S","chronDate":"7-9 June 1988","isNumber":"573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"706","citationCount":"10","articleId":"15497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":15503,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

However, the two DPCM/interpolation methods offer other advantages when used with a variable-wordlength coder.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Region 5 Conference, 1988: 'Spanning the Peaks of Electrotechnology'","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Region 5 Conference, 1988: 'Spanning the Peaks of Electrotechnology'","pdfPath":"/iel2/728/575/00015907.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"98","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Still-frame image transmission using DPCM/interpolative coding","doi":"10.1109/REG5.1988.15907","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00015907.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REG5.1988.15907","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=15907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/15907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 1988","displayDocTitle":"Still-frame image transmission using DPCM/interpolative coding","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3259426","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 March 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Still-frame image transmission using DPCM/interpolative coding","confLoc":"Colorado Springs, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00015907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063569S","chronDate":"21-23 March 1988","isNumber":"575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"728","articleId":"15907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":15927,"authors":[{"name":"L.B.

The performance of the laser diode as an optical filter, its tuning range, amplification gain, crosstalk due to submodes, and signal-to-noise ratio are determined. To achieve maximum amplification with the least noise, the DFB-LD injection current is held at or near the threshold value by feedback from an optical detector. The resonant wavelength is precisely controlled over a range of 2.0 nm (154 GHz) by varying the temperature of the DFB-LD, while at the same time the injection current is kept at the optimum value by the feedback system. By using the tunable amplification properties of a DFB-LD, an optical tunable filter was experimentally observed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed feedback devices","Tunable circuits and devices","Laser feedback","Optical filters","Optical feedback","Laser tuning","Diode lasers","Crosstalk","Laser noise","Optical tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","distributed feedback lasers","feedback","laser tuning","optical filters","semiconductor junction lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser tuning","distributed feedback laser diodes","DFB-LD","optical filter","amplification gain","crosstalk","signal-to-noise ratio","feedback","optical detector","154 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.16259","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016259.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/582/00016259.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.16259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable amplification properties of distributed feedback laser diodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tunable amplification properties of distributed feedback laser diodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16259/","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3376127","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable amplification properties of distributed feedback laser diodes","sourcePdf":"00016259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041326S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"17","articleId":"16259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":16266,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Twisted bit-line architectures to reduce or eliminate the noise are proposed and demonstrated by the soft-error rate improvement of a 1-Mb DRAM.

Accelerated soft error tests were performed on each sample. The results suggest the existence of two types of noise effects. One is the READ-signal degradation just after the work-line rises. The other is the disturbance in sensing operation. The larger the ratio of the bit-line coupling capacitance to the other bit-line capacitance contributions the more serious both the noise effects are. These noise mechanisms can be explained by the charge conservation model and the simulation of sensing operation.

A special integrated test circuit which facilitates accurate and reproducible measurements is presented. The circuit has been used for carrying out metastability measurements in a wide temperature and voltage range to predict circuit parameters for worst-case designs. Results from measurements and circuit simulation indicate that different criteria for optimizing flip-flop performance should be used for synchronizers and for those applications where the observation of timing constraints imposed on flip-flop input signals can be guaranteed. These results can help in determining the reliability of existing synchronizer and arbiter designs. By means of special synchronizer cells the reliability of asynchronous interfaces can be improved significantly, enabling the system design to gain speed and flexibility in communication between independently clocked submodules.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016314.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/584/00016314.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.16314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.16314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metastability behavior of CMOS ASIC flip-flops in theory and test","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metastasis","Application specific integrated circuits","Flip-flops","Circuit testing","Integrated circuit measurements","Synchronization","Semiconductor device modeling","Temperature distribution","Voltage","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","digital integrated circuits","flip-flops","reliability","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide temperature range","wide voltage range","metastability behaviour","speed improvement","CMOS ASIC flip-flops","flip-flop structures","CMOS ASIC implementations","simplified models","structural approaches","optimized metastable behavior","integrated test circuit","reproducible measurements","metastability measurements","worst-case designs","circuit simulation","criteria for optimizing flip-flop performance","synchronizers","timing constraints","reliability","arbiter designs","special synchronizer cells","reliability of asynchronous interfaces"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Metastability behavior of CMOS ASIC flip-flops in theory and test","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3375656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metastability behavior of CMOS ASIC flip-flops in theory and test","sourcePdf":"00016314.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042487S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"83","articleId":"16314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":16316,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.

This approach produced a capacity of 154 nF/cm/sup 2/ with a maximum voltage coefficient of 210 p.p.m./V over a bias range of +or-7.5 V. In the second approach the high-dose implant is performed prior to the gate oxidation. Impurity-concentration-enhanced oxidation of the n/sup +/ silicon bottom plates can then be exploited during the subsequent gate oxidation to grow simultaneously a capacitor dielectric of varying thickness.

The differentiation waveforms and the good consistency between the measured and the simulated circuit responses verify the correct operation of the SC differentiators.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3375660","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New monolithic switched-capacitor differentiators with good noise rejection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New monolithic switched-capacitor differentiators with good noise rejection","sourcePdf":"00016318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027549S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","articleId":"16318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":16319,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Information is organized into units called pages, and at any instant of time, two or more users may request the same page. Broadcast delivery is attractive for such an environment because a single transmission of a page will satisfy all pending requests for that page. Three alternative architectures for broadcast information delivery systems are considered. They are one-way broadcast, two-way interaction, and hybrid one-way broadcast/two-way interaction. An important design issue is the scheduling of page transmissions such that the user response time is minimized. For each architecture, existing scheduling algorithms are described, and their mean-response-time performance evaluated. Properties of scheduling algorithms that yield optimal mean response time are discussed. A comparative discussion of the performance differences of the three architectures is also provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016350.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/586/00016350.pdf","startPage":"1566","endPage":"1577","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.16350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.16350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcast delivery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Radio broadcasting","TV broadcasting","Processor scheduling","Videotex","Scheduling algorithm","Councils","Computer science","Databases","Teletext"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information services","teletext","viewdata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channel","pages","single transmission","information delivery systems","one-way broadcast","two-way interaction","hybrid one-way broadcast/two-way interaction","user response time","scheduling algorithms","mean-response-time performance","optimal mean response time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast delivery","volume":"76","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3369486","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast delivery","sourcePdf":"00016350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045858S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"177","articleId":"16350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":16351,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The context is experimental access to real neuronal assemblies in working brains, as made possible by recent technological progress. One current measure of assembly organization is based on the correlation of firing among neurons; recent observations show that such correlations can vary rapidly. It is shown that the dynamic firing correlation can be caused either by dynamic changes in neuronal connection strengths or, alternatively, by the effects of an unobserved (large) pool of other neurons. The static connectivity within the pool appears to be important in determining these effects.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.16444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.16444","endPage":"14","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016444.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/591/00016444.pdf","startPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuronal assemblies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16444/","displayDocTitle":"Neuronal assemblies","volume":"36","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3354669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"2646211","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuronal assemblies","sourcePdf":"00016444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04793S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"203","articleId":"16444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":16447,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Noise converts the basically nonlinear operation of a spoke initiator into a nearly linear modulation process. This linearization effect of noise is examined in a simple intuitive model of a static threshold and in a more realistic computer simulation of spike initiator based on the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. The results are qualitatively similar; in each case larger noise amplitude results in a larger range of nearly linear modulation. The computer simulation of the HH model with noise shows linear and nonlinear features that were earlier observed in spike data obtained from the VIIIth nerve of the bullfrog. This suggests that these features can be explained in terms of spike initiator properties, and it also suggests that the HH model may be useful for representing basic spike initiator properties in vertebrates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/591/00016447.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.16447","startPage":"36","endPage":"43","doi":"10.1109/10.16447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Studies with spike initiators: linearization by noise allows continuous signal modulation in neural networks","volume":"36","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3354672","pubMedId":"2784125","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies with spike initiators: linearization by noise allows continuous signal modulation in neural networks","sourcePdf":"00016447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0857S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"61","articleId":"16447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":16450,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Elementary control system tools are applied to extend dynamical neural-network models to the visual smooth pursuit system. Observed eye position responses to target motions and characteristics of the plant (eye muscles and orbital mechanics) place dynamical constraints on the interposed neural-network controller. In the process of constructing a model for the controller, it is shown that two previous pursuit-system models, using efference copy and feedforward compensation, are equivalent from an input-output standpoint. A controller model possessing a potentially highly parallel implementation is introduced, and an example with supporting neural firing rate data is presented. Changes in time delays or other system dynamics are expected to lead to compensatory adaptive changes in the controller.

The center/surround receptive field profiles of neurons in the retina and geniculate are far from an orthogonal set, but a given neuron can still be regarded as a decorrelator of the incoming signal in the sense that it responds primarily to changes in the image. At the level of the brain's visual cortex, the introduction of the new variable of orientation selectivity can be regarded not only as a means for providing orientation labels for image structure, but also more basically as an effective decorrelator of the neural representation. The present image coding simulations, based on quantitative neurobiological data about the code primitives, provide measures of the bit-rate efficiency of such oriented, quadrature, neural codes. Demonstrations of data compression to below 1 bit/pixel in cortically-based, quadrature self-similar wavelet image codes are also provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3354677","pubMedId":"2921058","displayDocTitle":"Entropy reduction and decorrelation in visual coding by oriented neural receptive fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy reduction and decorrelation in visual coding by oriented neural receptive fields","sourcePdf":"00016456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051354S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"102","articleId":"16456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":16457,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that textures and fully textured images can be practically decomposed into, and synthesized from, a finite set of EFs. Textured-images can be synthesized from a set of EFs using an image coefficient library. Alternatively, texturing of contoured (cartoonlike) images is analogous to adding chromaticity information to contoured images. A method for texture discrimination and image segmentation using local features based on the Gabor approach is introduced. Features related to the EF's parameters provide efficient means for texture discrimination and classification. This method is invariant under rotation and translation. The performance of the classification appears to be robust with respect to noisy conditions. The results show the insensitivity of the discrimination to relatively high noise levels, comparable to the performances of the human observer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016457.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/591/00016457.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.16457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.16457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localized texture processing in vision: analysis and synthesis in the Gaborian space","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image representation","Image segmentation","Frequency","Image edge detection","Image texture analysis","Bandwidth","Libraries","Noise robustness","Noise level","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation primitives","visual analysis","visual processing","localized texture processing","contoured images","cartoonlike images","vision","Gaborian space","cortical simple cell function","wavelet form","image coefficient library","chromaticity information","texture discrimination","image segmentation","noisy conditions"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Depth Perception","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Neurological","Visual Perception"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Localized texture processing in vision: analysis and synthesis in the Gaborian space","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3354678","pubMedId":"2921059","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localized texture processing in vision: analysis and synthesis in the Gaborian space","sourcePdf":"00016457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039951S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"130","articleId":"16457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":16463,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

A method to handle the numerical difficulties caused by the presence of poorly conducting skull is presented. Using the method, both the potential on the surface of the head and the magnetic field outside the head can be computed accurately. The procedure is tested with the multilayer sphere model, for which analytical expressions are available. The method is then applied to a realistically shaped head model, and it is shown numerically that for the computation of B produced by cerebral current sources, it is sufficient to consider a brain-shaped homogeneous conductor only, since the secondary currents on the outer interfaces give only a negligible contribution to the magnetic field outside the head. Comparisons with the sphere model are included to pinpoint areas where the homogeneous conductor model provides essential improvements in the calculation of the magnetic field outside the head.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.16463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=592","startPage":"165","endPage":"171","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/592/00016463.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic conductivity geometry model of the human head for interpretation of neuromagnetic data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Realistic conductivity geometry model of the human head for interpretation of neuromagnetic data","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3354682","pubMedId":"2917762","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic conductivity geometry model of the human head for interpretation of neuromagnetic data","sourcePdf":"00016463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038909S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"706","articleId":"16463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":16470,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The same methods can be extended for sorting in higher dimensions, for example, in the three-dimensional mesh. The concept of clean and dirty rows can be modified to clean and dirty planes (or hyperplanes for dimensions greater than three). Although only two schemes (purely recursive and iterative) are explicitly described, the reader may construct his own algorithm using similar technique and slight modifications.

An approach for obtaining the transient and the steady-state solutions of the fork-join queue in terms of the virtual waiting times, which can be used to obtain the response time and the delay between the fork and the join instants, is presented. With the restriction of the service time being the Erlangian distribution, the formulations result in a form of a series, the worth of which is in actually computing numerical results. The joint-state-occupancy probabilities can be easily deduced from the results. The approximate solutions in the steady state are presented for the cases where the interarrival time distributions are exponential and hyperexponential, and the service-time distributions are exponential and two-state Erlangian. The parallelism achievable with synchronization constraints is examined from the approximations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.16501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/594/00016501.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"255","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016501.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.16501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the fork-join queue","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16501/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the fork-join queue","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3366268","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the fork-join queue","sourcePdf":"00016501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179458S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"53","articleId":"16501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":16507,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

The version of the PRAM considered, also called the CREW model is a parallel computer with global memory accessible in unit time; it allows concurrent reads, but requires exclusive writes. Two dynamic processor allocation problems for P processors are distinguished. One, called assignment from numbers, has an Omega (log P) lower bound, even when the number of tasks is O( square root P). The second, called assignment from leaders, has faster solutions. A constant-time solution for O( square root P) tasks is known; it is generalized to O(P/sup 1-1/k/) tasks in time O(k). Handling O(P) tasks requires a different approach and an algorithm that runs in time O(log log P) is proposed which is asymptotically optimal within a constant factor. The implications of these two versions of dynamic allocation on sublogarithmic merge algorithms are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.16507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.16507","endPage":"292","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016507.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/594/00016507.pdf","startPage":"289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRAM processor allocation: a hidden bottleneck in sublogarithmic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16507/","displayDocTitle":"PRAM processor allocation: a hidden bottleneck in sublogarithmic algorithms","volume":"38","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3366274","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRAM processor allocation: a hidden bottleneck in sublogarithmic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00016507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03332S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","articleId":"16507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":16508,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

A detailed study of phenomena in both polarities is presented, and the minimum conditions required for streamer breakdown voltage measurements under AC are established. In negative polarity, the generation of a microscopic gas bubble ( approximately 10 mu m in diameter) immediately precedes the development of streamers. In the case of bushlike streamers, it is concluded from energetic considerations that the vaporization of the liquid constitutes the main process of streamer growth. In positive polarity, similar conclusions are drawn for slow bushlike streamers, whereas in the case of fast filamentary streamers, it is observed that the conductivity of filaments determines their propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/14.16519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/595/00016519.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.16519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=595","startPage":"941","endPage":"954","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016519.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streamer generation and propagation in transformer oil under AC divergent field conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Streamer generation and propagation in transformer oil under AC divergent field conditions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3332230","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streamer generation and propagation in transformer oil under AC divergent field conditions","sourcePdf":"00016519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057321S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"110","articleId":"16519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":16538,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

For both arrays, a continuous flow of input vectors is allowed and no idle period is required between successive vectors. The array coefficients are static and thus stored-product ROMs (read-only memories) can be used in place of multipliers to limit cost as well as eliminate errors due to coefficient quantization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.16566","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016566.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/598/00016566.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.16566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient one-dimensional systolic array realization of the discrete Fourier transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16566/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient one-dimensional systolic array realization of the discrete Fourier transform","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3366637","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient one-dimensional systolic array realization of the discrete Fourier transform","sourcePdf":"00016566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052575S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"47","articleId":"16566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":16577,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is called the adaptive weighted median filter (AWMF) and is based on the weighted median, which originates from the well-known median filter through the introduction of weight coefficients. By adjusting the weight coefficients and consequently the smoothing characteristics of the filter according to the local statistics around each point of the image, it is possible to suppress noise while edges and other important features are preserved. Application of the filter to several ultrasonic scans has shown that processing improves the detectability of small structures and subtle gray-scale variations without affecting the sharpness or anatomical information of the original image. Comparison with the pure median filter demonstrates the superiority of adaptive techniques over their space-invariant counterparts. Examples of processed images show that the AWMF preserves small details better than other nonlinear space-varying filters which offer equal noise reduction in uniform areas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016577.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/598/00016577.pdf","doi":"10.1109/31.16577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.16577","startPage":"129","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive weighted median filter for speckle suppression in medical ultrasonic images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16577/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive weighted median filter for speckle suppression in medical ultrasonic images","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3366644","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive weighted median filter for speckle suppression in medical ultrasonic images","sourcePdf":"00016577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053571S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"477","articleId":"16577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":16588,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These results lead to definite performance limits (e.g., bit rate) for the electrical interconnections from a printed wiring board to a high-speed chip. For advanced physical designs, tolerable pulse-waveform degradation occurs for bit rates of a few Gb/s. However, for much higher bit rates, serious pulse degradation can occur.

Computer-controlled ink-jet-assisted metallization for photovoltaics in the low processing temperature range was studied. With a titanium/palladium thin-film underlayer and the multilayer printing method, satisfactory cells for 8.08% average without AR coating were obtained. The effects of thermal processes on the solar cells were investigated. It was observed that appropriate thermal processes could improve the contact resistance and the efficiency of the solar cells, but excess thermal processes would destroy the solar cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16656/","volume":"11","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3291563","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Metallization of solar cells with ink jet printing and silver metallo-organic inks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metallization of solar cells with ink jet printing and silver metallo-organic inks","sourcePdf":"00016656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034515S","chronDate":"Sept.  1988","isNumber":"602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"64","articleId":"16656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":16669,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The method uses a multiple regression technique whose input is the thermal profile due to a unit heat source over an infinite multi-layered plate structure. The unit profile in two dimensions is calculated using the Fourier integral solution and matched to an equation having several parameters. The temperature profiles of rectangular device structures having the same layered composition are computed by superposing the profiles generated by the matched equation, shifted in position according to the source location and weighted by the source power. By using the proposed approach, it is possible to reduce the CPU time required by a factor of several hundred thousand compared to analytical approaches and numerical techniques. As a result, it is possible to perform IC (integrated circuit) thermal design at the chip level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3332545","volume":"11","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-time thermal design of integrated circuit devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time thermal design of integrated circuit devices","sourcePdf":"00016687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146122S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"25","articleId":"16687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":16694,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The decomposition is data driven with no restriction on segment shapes. It can be viewed as a tree, where the nodes correspond to picture segments and where links between nodes indicate set inclusions. Picture segmentation is first regarded as a problem of piecewise picture approximation, which consists of finding the partition with the minimum approximation error. Then, picture segmentation is presented as an hypothesis-testing process which merges only segments that belong to the same region. A hierarchical decomposition constraint is used in both cases, which results in the same stepwise optimization algorithm. At each iteration, the two most similar segments are merged by optimizing a stepwise criterion. The algorithm is used to segment a remote-sensing picture, and illustrate the hierarchical structure of the picture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.16711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/604/00016711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.16711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=604","startPage":"150","endPage":"163","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016711.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchy in picture segmentation: a stepwise optimization approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchy in picture segmentation: a stepwise optimization approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3383939","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchy in picture segmentation: a stepwise optimization approach","sourcePdf":"00016711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037954S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"202","articleId":"16711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":16712,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The method is efficiently implementable on parallel architectures, and provides a unifying procedure for performing a hierarchical, multiscale, coarse-to-fine analysis of image-processing tasks such as restoration, texture analysis, coding, motion analysis, etc. The method is formulated and applied to the restoration of degraded images. The restoration algorithm is a global-optimization algorithm applicable to other optimization problems. It generates iteratively a multilevel cascode of restored images corresponding to different levels of resolution, or scale. In the lower levels of the cascade appear the large-scale features of the image, and in the higher levels, the microscopic features of the image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.16712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.16712","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/604/00016712.pdf","startPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A renormalization group approach to image processing problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16712/","displayDocTitle":"A renormalization group approach to image processing problems","volume":"11","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3383940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A renormalization group approach to image processing problems","sourcePdf":"00016712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053387S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"142","articleId":"16712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":16713,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Experimental results show that a high compression ratio can be achieved for simple or complicated images. A method accounting for the three-dimensional effects is proposed as a way of selecting the irregular samples from the image.

In general, the proposed method was shown to reduce the reconstruction error both qualitatively and quantitatively, and can be used to model the image surface for the purpose of data compression and representation.

They are linear quadratic Gaussian theory, where the plant actuator and output variance can be traded off, and Nevanlinna-Pick theory, where, for instance, the achievable disturbance rejection can be traded off in two different bandwidths. In many cases, the limit of performance achievable with a linear time-invariant controller, and thus the exact form of the tradeoffs, can be computed numerically. To demonstrate this trade-off, the design of a regulator for a very typical plant, a double integrator with some excess phase, is examined.

The author describes some of the requirements in detail, compares alternative high-performance trajectory types, describes the properties of the quintic polynomials used, discusses how to determine if a trajectory is feasible, and then outlines the implementation and its performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3381626","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Aggressive trajectory generator for a robot ping-pong player","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggressive trajectory generator for a robot ping-pong player","sourcePdf":"00016766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064086S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"42","articleId":"16766","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":16779,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

A generalization of I-testing called sequential I-testing (SI-testing) is described, which allows identical response streams to be produced at different times and be subsequently synchronized for comparison purposes. The concepts of k-regular and nearly k-regular circuits are introduced, which generalize regular circuits (iterative logic arrays) to array-like circuits that contain several cell-types and are moderately irregular.

Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, its low sensitivity to observation noise, and its improved performance in terms of probability of error or the reconstructed transmitted sequence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of multipath channel response in frequency selective channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.16839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/614/00016839.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016839.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.16839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of multipath channel response in frequency selective channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3374496","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of multipath channel response in frequency selective channels","sourcePdf":"00016839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040194S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"52","articleId":"16839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":16840,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.C.

Results from the temporal experiments show that, for a specific location in either of the two buildings, the dynamics of indoor channels are slightly less random at 910 MHz than at 1.7 GHz. It is believed that this would result in marginally better performance on a given transmit/receive link in the 900 MHz band.

Results show that multipath propagation conditions would be significantly less severe if small-celled systems were implemented. Root-mean-square delay spread averages computed by considering all multipath signal components with powers greater than 25 dB below the peak were reduced by a factor of approximately four in comparison to those typical in conventional systems. In addition, microcellular-type channels have Rician, rather than Rayleigh, envelope fading characteristics and correspondingly different frequency correlation statistics. The area bounded by the correlation envelope is introduced as a measure of channel quality, and these areas are shown to be larger for Rician channels than for Rayleigh channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16841/","volume":"7","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3374498","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Propagation characteristics on microcellular urban mobile radio channels at 910 MHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation characteristics on microcellular urban mobile radio channels at 910 MHz","sourcePdf":"00016841.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073662S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"182","articleId":"16841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":16842,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

A short-range multipoint-to-base station packet radio network is considered. It is shown that larger capture effects and thus improved network performance can be achieved with proper choice of modulation. It is also shown that the use of simple error-correcting codes improves capture. The use of selection diversity also improves the capture effect both for fast and slow fading. It is concluded that the inverse distance variability of the received signal is the main reason for the capture effect. The Rayleigh fading alone yields a very small contribution in terms of throughput; nonetheless, it helps to stabilize the system. Numerical results are presented for a slotted ALOHA system with 50 users. It is found that the maximum average throughput can be increased from about 36% to almost 60% by using channel coding and space diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016846.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/614/00016846.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.16846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.16846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ALOHA with capture over slow and fast fading radio channels with coding and diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Throughput","Rayleigh channels","Delay effects","Delay systems","Error correction codes","Spread spectrum communication","Performance analysis","Base stations","Packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","encoding","error correction codes","fading","protocols","radiocommunication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short range multipoint-to-base station network","fast fading","average system throughput","delay performance","slotted ALOHA","Rayleigh fading radio channels","packet radio network","capture effects","error-correcting codes","selection diversity","slow fading","inverse distance variability","channel coding","space diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"ALOHA with capture over slow and fast fading radio channels with coding and diversity","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3374503","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ALOHA with capture over slow and fast fading radio channels with coding and diversity","sourcePdf":"00016846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103235S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"104","articleId":"16846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":16847,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

It operates adaptively, in a training mode at the beginning of each burst, as well as in a tracking mode during message detection.

The ACT mode digitally controls the reference phase, and enables instantaneous phase tracking in burst signal operation and/or in a fast fading environment. The DCR coherent demodulator performance is identical to that of conventional coherent detection in the low-CNR region, and to that of differential detection in the high CNR region where the ACT mode is selected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016854.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/614/00016854.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.16854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.16854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=16854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast carrier-tracking coherent detection with dual-mode carrier recovery circuit for digital land mobile radio transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Demodulation","Fading","Land mobile radio","Quadrature phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Frequency modulation","Delay lines","Energy consumption","Automatic frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","digital radio systems","mobile radio systems","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast carrier tracking","coherent detection","dual-mode carrier recovery circuit","digital land mobile radio","phase locked-loop operation modes","adaptive carrier-tracking","instantaneous phase tracking","burst signal operation","fast fading environment","coherent demodulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Fast carrier-tracking coherent detection with dual-mode carrier recovery circuit for digital land mobile radio transmission","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3374509","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast carrier-tracking coherent detection with dual-mode carrier recovery circuit for digital land mobile radio transmission","sourcePdf":"00016854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058753S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"27","articleId":"16854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":16856,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Each user senses the channel load and refrains from transmission if the channel load exceeds the channel threshold.

The effect of laser chirping on the performance of multi-Gb/s lightwave systems operating at a wavelength of 1550 nm is investigated. Models suitable for computer-aided analysis are used to describe the dynamic response of the laser and the propagation of chirped optical pulses through a step-index single-mode optical fibre. A truncated pulse train, Gauss quadrature rule method is used to evaluate the average bit error rate of the receiver. This permits pattern effects in the transmitted optical waveform due to the laser dynamics and nonlinear optical power transmission properties of optical fibers to be included in the system model. The influence that modulation and device parameters have on the receiver sensitivity is assessed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.16895","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00016895.png","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/616/00016895.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"573","doi":"10.1109/50.16895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of laser chirping on lightwave system performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"The effect of laser chirping on lightwave system performance","volume":"7","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3374911","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/16895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of laser chirping on lightwave system performance","sourcePdf":"00016895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038233S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"101","articleId":"16895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":16926,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

Alternatively, the combs can be enhanced to produce a compact low-loss feedback element for potential application in multimode oscillators. Experimental verification of the analysis is provided by a 3:2 slanted-finger IIDT filter with a 10% relative bandwidth of 5.9-dB insertion loss, and a comb filter with 13.4-dB insertion loss and comb spacing of about 3 MHz.

By using analytic basis functions together with finite-element approximation functions in a variational technique, the transfinite-element method determines the fields and scattering parameters for a wide variety of stripline and microstrip devices. With minor modification, the method can be applied to waveguide junctions, treating singular points in the junctions very efficiently. Calculations are shown for a rectangular-waveguide two-slot 20-dB coupler, stripline band-elimination filter, and several microstrip discontinuity problems. Good agreement of the numerical results with published values demonstrates the validity of the procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.17395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/632/00017395.pdf","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.17395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The transfinite element method for modeling MMIC devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17395/","displayDocTitle":"The transfinite element method for modeling MMIC devices","volume":"36","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3332107","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The transfinite element method for modeling MMIC devices","sourcePdf":"00017395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104637S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"64","articleId":"17395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17397,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

This provides an efficient tool for the otherwise expensive but essential gradient calculations in design optimization. The hierarchical approach widely used for circuit simulation, is generalized to sensitivity analysis and to computing responses in any subnetwork at any level of the hierarchy. Important aspects of frequency-domain circuit computer-aided design (CAD) such as simulation and sensitivity analysis, linear and nonlinear circuits, hierarchical and nonhierarchical approaches, voltage and current excitations, or open- and short-circuit terminations are unified in this general framework. The theory provides a basis for the next generation of microwave CAD software. It takes advantage of mature techniques such as syntax-oriented hierarchical analysis, optimization, and yield-driven design to handle nonlinear as well as linear circuits. The sensitivity analysis approach has been verified by a MESFET mixer example, exhibiting a 90% saving of CPU time over the prevailing perturbation method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.17397","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"1661","endPage":"1669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/632/00017397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.17397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified theory for frequency-domain simulation and sensitivity analysis of linear and nonlinear circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit simulation","Sensitivity analysis","Computational modeling","Design automation","Frequency domain analysis","Analytical models","Design optimization","Circuit analysis computing","Computer simulation","Nonlinear circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","circuit CAD","frequency-domain analysis","linear network analysis","microwave circuits","nonlinear network analysis","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage excitation","open circuit terminations","unified theory","frequency-domain simulation","sensitivity analysis","nonlinear circuits","harmonic balance technique","gradient calculations","design optimization","computer-aided design","CAD","current excitations","short-circuit terminations","microwave CAD software","syntax-oriented hierarchical analysis","yield-driven design","linear circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1988","displayDocTitle":"A unified theory for frequency-domain simulation and sensitivity analysis of linear and nonlinear circuits","volume":"36","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3343617","publicationDate":"Dec. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17397/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified theory for frequency-domain simulation and sensitivity analysis of linear and nonlinear circuits","sourcePdf":"00017397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038696S","chronDate":"Dec.  1988","isNumber":"632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"56","articleId":"17397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17403,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

Numerical results for resonant length, backscattered wave amplitude, and phase variation off-resonance are presented over a range of values of the waveguide b dimension, wall thickness, slot width, and frequency. It is shown that the resonant length is relatively insensitive to slot tilt, theta , for a standard-height X-band waveguide, whereas its dependence on theta is significant for reduced-height waveguides. The phase variation of scattered TE/sub 10/ waves in both waveguides off-resonance is less for wider slots and smaller b dimensions. Shunt-series coupling slots exhibit greater phase variation off resonance when compared to a centred-inclined coupling slot. Also, the former has a longer resonant length for a smaller b dimension and for a wider slot. Thus the centred-inclined slot coupler possesses superior characteristics. The higher-order mode coupling between a centred-inclined slot coupler and a pair of straddling radiating slots in the branch waveguide is significant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.17455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"884","endPage":"889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.17455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=633","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/633/00017455.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integral equations","Coupling circuits","Moment methods","Resonance","Rectangular waveguides","Scattering","Dielectric losses","Apertures","Frequency","Planar waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral equations","S-matrix theory","S-parameters","waveguide couplers","waveguide theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moments method","integral equations","shunt-series coupling slots","waveguide slot coupler","centered-inclined coupling slot","finite wall-thickness","slot-aperture electric intensity field","resonant length","backscattered wave amplitude","phase variation off-resonance","slot width","frequency","slot tilt","standard-height X-band waveguide","reduced-height waveguides","scattered TE/sub 10/ waves","higher-order mode coupling","straddling radiating slots","branch waveguide"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a centered-inclined waveguide slot coupler","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17455/","volume":"37","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3393658","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a centered-inclined waveguide slot coupler","sourcePdf":"00017455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026877S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"78","articleId":"17455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":17459,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These entropy-constrained vector quantizers (ECVQs) can be used in tandem with variable-rate noiseless coding systems to provide locally optimal variable-rate block source coding with respect to a fidelity criterion. Experiments on sampled speech and on synthetic sources with memory indicate that for waveform coding at low rates (about 1 bit/sample) under the squared error distortion measure, about 1.6 dB improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio can be expected over the best scalar and lattice quantizers when block entropy-coded with block length 4. Even greater gains are made over other forms of entropy-coded vector quantizers. For pattern recognition, it is shown that the ECVQ algorithm is a generalization of the k-means and related algorithms for estimating cluster means, in that the ECVQ algorithm estimates the prior cluster probabilities as well. Experiments on multivariate Gaussian distributions show that for clustering problems involving classes with widely different priors, the ECVQ outperforms the k-means algorithm in both likelihood and probability of error.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.17498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/635/00017498.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.17498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy-constrained vector quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Entropy-constrained vector quantization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17498/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3366648","volume":"37","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy-constrained vector quantization","sourcePdf":"00017498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122958S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"635","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"442","articleId":"17498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":17499,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

These receivers are: the matched filter, which is the classical linear receiver based on a Gaussian assumption; the correlation-limiter, which is the Neyman-Pearson minimax robust receiver when the noise uncertainty is modeled as a mixture process with a Gaussian nominal; and the Gaussian-Gaussian mixture likelihood ratio receiver. This last receiver is adaptive in the sense that it is based on a parametric model whose parameters are computed from the actual data. The principal results of this study are that, in terms of the receiving operating curves, the adaptive receiver performs better than the linear one which, in turn, performs slightly better than the robust correlator-limiter.

The method is precisely defined, including a previously unnoticed detail which makes a significant difference to the accuracy of the result. The experiments show that, with no input windowing, the accuracy of interpolation is almost independent of sinusoidal wavelength very close to the Nyquist limit. The resulting RMS error is inversely proportional to input sequence length and is very low for sequence lengths likely to be encountered in practice. As wavelength passes through the Nyquist limit, there is a sudden increase in error, as is expected from sampling theory. If the sequence ends are windowed by short, cosine half-bells, accuracy is further improved at longer wavelengths. In comparison, small-kernal convolution methods, such as linear interpolation and cubic convolution, perform badly at wavelengths anywhere near the Nyquist limit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.17559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/637/00017559.pdf","startPage":"665","endPage":"675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.17559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation by the FFT revisited-an experimental investigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17559/","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation by the FFT revisited-an experimental investigation","volume":"37","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3421282","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation by the FFT revisited-an experimental investigation","sourcePdf":"00017559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037965S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"85","articleId":"17559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17560,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

Since dynamic range scaling is inherent to the proposed structure, it is felt that this design technique may be most useful in programmable or adaptive filters.

A method is given to obtain these transformations by inspection, based on fundamental loops and cutsets of both the capacitor and alternate trees. When the nonlinearities in the capacitors and inductors are small, a change of coordinates is given to achieve complete separation of the canonical variables of the unperturbed (linear) system. These results should allow the application of techniques from Hamiltonian dynamics, such as canonical perturbation theory, to circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.17588","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00017588.png","startPage":"411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/638/00017588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.17588","endPage":"420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for obtaining a canonical Hamiltonian for nonlinear LC circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"A method for obtaining a canonical Hamiltonian for nonlinear LC circuits","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3376352","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for obtaining a canonical Hamiltonian for nonlinear LC circuits","sourcePdf":"00017588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042021S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"20","articleId":"17588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":17589,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

The efficiency and the maximum operating frequency of the amplifier are intermediate between those of the Class C and E amplifiers. The collector efficiency of the Class C amplifier is about 70%, whereas that of the Class E amplifier is about 96%. The maximum operating frequency of the optimum-efficiency Class E amplifier is, however, limited by the transistor output capacitance. The operating frequency of the Class C amplifier can be at least 16 times higher than that of the optimum-efficiency Class E amplifier at the same output power, DC supply voltage, and transistor output capacitance. The Class C, E, and C-E amplifiers can be obtained with the same circuit topology. The class of operation depends on the values of the load-network components. The tradeoff between the efficiency and the maximum operating frequency is evaluated for all three classes, using nonlinear time-domain simulation. The experimental and theoretical results are in good agreement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.17589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/638/00017589.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.17589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class C-E high-efficiency tuned power amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17589/","displayDocTitle":"Class C-E high-efficiency tuned power amplifier","volume":"36","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3376353","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class C-E high-efficiency tuned power amplifier","sourcePdf":"00017589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052355S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"36","articleId":"17589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17668,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Zhengming","affiliation":["Acad.

Surface elevation is also included as the most important topographic effect. Land covers characterized by measured or modeled spectral emissivities include snow, clay, sands, and tree leaf samples. The empirical inverse model can estimate the surface temperature with a standard deviation less than 0.3 K and a maximum error less than 1 K.

The author examines the scientific, technological, and cultural contexts of the decision-making process to understand why the CCC's engineers chose AC. He suggests that the decision was based as much on cultural criteria as on straightforward technical criteria. The engineers who made the decision felt that the technology used at the Falls should match the natural grandeur of the Falls with its own technological grandeur. Thus they chose a power system that, though untried, was developing rapidly and held great future promise. Their scheme proved successful, and the Niagara Falls power project, by far the largest of its day, established the standards for hydroelectric power generation and transmission for many years.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17682/","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3408429","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmitting the power of Niagara: scientific, technological, and cultural contexts of an engineering decision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitting the power of Niagara: scientific, technological, and cultural contexts of an engineering decision","sourcePdf":"00017682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056325S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"44","citationCount":"1","articleId":"17682","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17708,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The frequency difference of the LDs is continuously varied with temperature changes of a few degrees and the spectral linewidth of one of the LDs is narrowed by optical feedback using a grating. Wideband, highly sensitive measurement has been achieved for a p-i-n photodiode and a Ge avalanche photodiode from DC to 20 GHz. The result is compared with that of the pulse spectrum analysis (PSA) method. Although the finite pulsewidth in the PSA method causes roll-off in the frequency response, the optical heterodyne method has the advantage for very wideband frequency response measurement. The S/N ratio in the optical heterodyne method can be made as high ( approximately 40 dB) as that of the PSA method by narrowing the spectral linewidth of DFB-LDs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.17738","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/649/00017738.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"98","doi":"10.1109/50.17738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband frequency-response measurement of optical receivers using optical heterodyne detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Wideband frequency-response measurement of optical receivers using optical heterodyne detection","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3374850","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband frequency-response measurement of optical receivers using optical heterodyne detection","sourcePdf":"00017738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035855S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"37","articleId":"17738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":17749,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Despite the absence of optical isolators and even with the introduction of additional external reflections (R approximately=1.0%), the optical fiber-to-fiber gain is stable over a large temperature range at resonance ( Delta G<or=0.35 dB Delta T=+or-0.75 degrees C at G=5.76 dB). Although the amplifier is capable of higher levels of gain (G/sub max/ approximately=13 dB), it is considered that stable gain, relative to variations in temperature and reflectivity is more critical to the overall system. It has been found that a multilongitudinal mode signal can be amplified by a resonant amplifier without system degradation caused by mode-partition noise, and that junction heating requires a thermal stabilization period up to approximately=0.2 ms after the start of a current pulse.<<ETX>>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor device packaging","Semiconductor lasers","Stimulated emission","Optical amplifiers","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Resonance","Pulse amplifiers","Fiber lasers","Laser modes","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","laser modes","laser transitions","reflectivity","semiconductor junction lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["III-V semiconductors","near-traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier","multilongitudinal modes","optical isolators","reflectivity","mode-partition noise","thermal stabilization period","1.30 micron","5.76 dB","InP-InGaAsP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.17749","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/649/00017749.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.17749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of packaged near-traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier with multilongitudinal mode input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of packaged near-traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier with multilongitudinal mode input","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17749/","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3374858","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of packaged near-traveling-wave semiconductor laser amplifier with multilongitudinal mode input","sourcePdf":"00017749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032074S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","articleId":"17749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":17750,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Measured and calculated core loss, with constant shaft load, is shown to increase with decreasing terminal voltage due to an increase in armature reaction-induced stator flux-density time harmonics. Finite-element modeling is used to show that the additional loss due to the time-harmonic fields can increase core loss by a factor of six over the loss associated with only the fundamental component field at low motor flux levels. A simple air-gap model of motor flux components shows that this increased loss is due to localized rotor saturation. Thus, stator-core harmonic fields should be expected for all buried-magnet rotor synchronous motors (with or without a cage) operating at low flux levels. This factor becomes increasingly important when the motors are operated in the high-speed low-flux mode in conjunction with a variable-speed drive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.17923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/654/00017923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.17923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=654","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Core loss in buried magnet permanent magnet synchronous motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Core loss in buried magnet permanent magnet synchronous motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3412290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Core loss in buried magnet permanent magnet synchronous motors","sourcePdf":"00017923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030388S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"66","articleId":"17923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17944,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

A discrete-time microprocessor-based controller, designed using the aforementioned dynamic model, has been built and tested using a simulation for a series-resonant DC/DC converter set up on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Parity Simulator. The control methods implemented are state feedback and periodic output feedback, each designed to achieve a specified set of closed-loop poles. The controller has been implemented using the Parity Simulator generalized controller. Results of the closed-loop response showed an improvement over the open-loop response. In addition, the effect of the microprocessor computation delay on the closed-loop dynamics of the converter is investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.17953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=657","startPage":"344","endPage":"354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/657/00017953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampled-data modeling and digital control of resonant converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1988","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sampled-data modeling and digital control of resonant converters","publicationDate":"July 1988","accessionNumber":"3334061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampled-data modeling and digital control of resonant converters","sourcePdf":"00017953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034825S","chronDate":"July  1988","isNumber":"657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"87","articleId":"17953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":17955,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Sheng Tsai","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Fu-Sheng Tsai","id":"37086867419"},{"name":"F.C.Y.

In addition to PWM waveforms, the inverter can generate six-step or eight-step waveforms in response to the appropriate software, using the MC68000 microprocessor. Operation takes places in the PWM model for 1-40 Hz and in a step mode for 40-100 Hz. The inverter used 12 power switches compared with the customary six switches in a standard inverter. Darlington power transistors were used in a laboratory prototype rated at 6 kW. A design feature is that power to the drive circuits of the twelve switches come directly from the DC supply, eliminating the need for individual power supplies. The root-mean-square value of the fundamental line voltage is 0.64 V DC compared to 0.5 V DC for conventional PWM operation with a six-switch inverter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motor drives","Pulse width modulation inverters","Switches","Pulse inverters","Microprocessors","Power transistors","Laboratories","Software prototyping","Prototypes","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","invertors","machine control","microcomputer applications","power engineering computing","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","power engineering computing","three-phase neutral point clamped inverter","motor control","microprocessor-controlled PWM","star-connected load","software","MC68000","power switches","Darlington power transistors","drive circuits","1 to 100 Hz","6 kW","0.64 V","0.5 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/63.17960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/658/00017960.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.17960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-phase neutral point clamped inverter for motor control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=17960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A three-phase neutral point clamped inverter for motor control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17960/","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1988","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3334066","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-phase neutral point clamped inverter for motor control","sourcePdf":"00017960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068715S","chronDate":"Oct.  1988","isNumber":"658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"19","articleId":"17960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":17961,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To control the torque of, say, an induction motor, it is sufficient to process the measured signals of the stator currents and the total flux linkages only. In the basic version of DSC, the power semiconductors of a three-phase voltage source inverter are directly switched on and off via three Schmitt triggers, comparing the time integrals of line-to-line voltages to a reference value of desired flux, if the torque has not yet reached an upper-limit value of a two-limit torque control. Optimal performance of drive systems is accomplished in steady state as well as under transient conditions by combination of several two-limit controls.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.17963","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"420","endPage":"429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/658/00017963.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00017963.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.17963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct self-control (DSC) of inverter-fed induction machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction machines","Signal processing","Torque control","Induction motors","Current measurement","Torque measurement","Stators","Couplings","Inverters","Power semiconductor switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","electric drives","invertors","machine control","power convertors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","machine control","torque control","inverter-fed induction machine","direct self-control","signal processing","converter-fed three-phase machines","dynamic performance","stator currents","total flux linkages","power semiconductors","Schmitt triggers","drive systems","two-limit controls"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Direct self-control (DSC) of inverter-fed induction machine","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3334069","publicationDate":"Oct. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/17963/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct self-control (DSC) of inverter-fed induction machine","sourcePdf":"00017963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032125S","chronDate":"Oct.  1988","isNumber":"658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"1213","articleId":"17963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":17968,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Sheng Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Fu-Sheng Tsai","id":"37086867419"},{"name":"P.

The architecture relies heavily on a triangular systolic structure as a means of solving recursive least-squares problems based on the QRD algorithm due to J.G. McWhirter (1983). A manifold of triangular systolic arrays, which in the limit takes the form of a cosmic cube, is used. With the proper time skew format for the data flow, it is shown that the cosmic cube beamformer can concurrently and simultaneously process the data from the rows and columns of array antennas with a speed comparable to the 1-D case.

It is shown that in the case of motor load, the presented method can be used at a higher frequency of operation, whereas at a lower frequency of operation, a uniform-area sampling method can be used. The sinusoidally sampled PWM technique can also be used for uninterruptible power supply systems and for a three-phase four-wire system, where it has an edge over the uniform-area sampling technique.

The proposed GTO circuit topology appears to satisfactorily provide independent real and reactive power control and maintain the high efficiency and fast response properties of the SMES system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1988.18148","publicationTitle":"PESC '88 Record., 19th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '88 Record., 19th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/711/664/00018148.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1988.18148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=664","startPage":"307","endPage":"312 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studies of power conditioning circuits for superconductive magnetic energy store","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Studies of power conditioning circuits for superconductive magnetic energy store","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 April 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18148/","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3258882","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies of power conditioning circuits for superconductive magnetic energy store","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00018148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035439S","chronDate":"11-14 April 1988","isNumber":"664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"711","citationCount":"6","articleId":"18148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":18155,"authors":[{"name":"H.

An induction motor with field-oriented control is modeled by a fast time-optimal position control system of second order that has two modes of operation: a bang-bang mode that operates until the position is close to target, followed by a DC breaking mode that provides asymptotic stability. This is achieved by substituting the time-optimal controller for the speed controller in the conventional field-oriented control loop of the motor. The validity of the time-optimal approach has been verified by an experimental test carried out with a prototype MC68000-based microcomputer system and a 5 HP induction motor.

In particular, there is a sharp reduction of inverter rating and operating loss about one-third to one-fourth, compared to results for an active filter without a coupling circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '88 Record., 19th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/711/664/00018258.pdf","startPage":"1168","endPage":"1173 vol.2","publicationTitle":"PESC '88 Record., 19th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1988.18258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1988.18258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=664","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of active filter with series resonant circuit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","RLC circuits","Inverters","Coupling circuits","Harmonic filters","Frequency","Harmonic distortion","Costs","Thyristors","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","distribution networks","harmonics","invertors","thyristor applications","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overload suppression","active filter","series resonant circuit","active AC harmonic filter","high-frequency inverters","LC circuit","fundamental frequency","distribution systems","voltage-source inverter","static-induction thyristor","instantaneous current response","control logic","coupling circuit characteristics","high-speed harmonic voltage detection","transient response","6.6 kV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 April 1988","displayDocTitle":"Development of active filter with series resonant circuit","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3278012","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 April 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of active filter with series resonant circuit","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"00018258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024408S","chronDate":"11-14 April 1988","isNumber":"664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"711","citationCount":"46","articleId":"18258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":18259,"authors":[{"name":"M.

With minimal capacitor matching requirements and comparator offset voltage cancellation, the converter is monotonic. To minimize charge-injection errors the converter is fully differential.

Included is a brief overview of sigma-delta conversion. The A/D converter achieves an 88.5-dB dynamic range and a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 81.5 dB. The harmonic distortion is negligible. This level of performance is about 10 dB higher than previously reported results for oversampled A/D converters in this frequency range. The analog modulator uses a double-integration switched-capacitor architecture with an oversampling rate of 10.24 MHz. Transconductance amplifiers having a 160-MHz f/sub t/ were developed for the integrators. The circuit is implemented in a 1.75- mu m 5-V CMOS process. The analog circuitry occupies 2 mm/sup 2/ of silicon area and consumes 75 mW of power. Some of the difficult problems associated with evaluating the performance of sigma-delta converters are described. The design of a sigma-delta development and performance evaluation system is presented. This system includes a custom interface board linking the chip to a Sun workstation, and extensive digital signal processing and analysis software.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.18584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/697/00018584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.18584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=697","startPage":"256","endPage":"266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 14-bit 80-kHz sigma-delta A/D converter: modeling, design and performance evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 14-bit 80-kHz sigma-delta A/D converter: modeling, design and performance evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3410000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 14-bit 80-kHz sigma-delta A/D converter: modeling, design and performance evaluation","sourcePdf":"00018584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031512S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"69","articleId":"18584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":18585,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

In this logic style, single logic gates produce multiple functions, and a circuit's device count can be reduced by a factor of more than 2, depending on the degree of recurrence in the circuit. In addition, MODL circuits are, by construction, considerably more stable than other dynamic circuits including conventional domino. A 32-bit carry lookahead (CLA) structure which reduces the adder's worst-case path by two logic stages has also been devised. This CLA structure has been developed to effectively utilize the advantages of MODL. Taken together, these developments have resulted in two 32-bit CMOS adders, providing area and speed improvements of 1.5* and 1.7* over the combination of the domino and conventional CLA techniques. Both adders have been fabricated in a standard 0.9- mu m two-level metal CMOS technology, and measured results show that the straight adder has achieved 32-bit addition times of less than 3.1 ns at 25 degrees C with V/sub DD/+5.0 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.18596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/697/00018596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.18596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"358","endPage":"369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultrafast compact 32-bit CMOS adders in multiple-output domino logic","volume":"24","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3420742","publicationDate":"April 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrafast compact 32-bit CMOS adders in multiple-output domino logic","sourcePdf":"00018596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032386S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"80","articleId":"18596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":18599,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The architecture is extensible, and can provide a level of integration comparable to mask-programmable gate arrays.

The overhead needed to program the antifuses is minimized by an addressing scheme that utilizes the wiring segments, pass transistors between adjacent segments, shared control lines, and serial addressing circuitry at the periphery of the array. This circuitry can also be used to test the device prior to programming and observe internal nodes after programming.

These include orthogonal transformations. Applications of this chip include projections, discrete Fourier and cosine transforms, and geometrical transformations. Large transforms may be computed by 'tilting' together many chips for increased throughput. A CMOS VLSI chip containing 138000 transistors in a 5*3 array of rotators has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The chip has a 32-MHz clock and performs real rotations at a rate of 30 MHz. The systolic nature of the chip makes use of a fully synchronous bit-serial interconnect and a very regular structure at the rotator and bit levels.

A 4:2 carry-save accumulator at the bottom of the array is used to iteratively accumulate partial products, allowing a partial array to be used, which reduces area.

An idealized self-aligned transistor layout is used to eliminate geometry differences from the comparison, and hence to allow the roles of the heterojunction and of the fundamental material, and the device properties to be identified. The gate delays of GaAlAs/GaAs and silicon circuits are predicted. It is shown that the lower gate delays of GaAlAs/GaAs circuits arise primarily from the use of a heterojunction emitter, and also because the peak f/sub T/ of the GaAlAs/GaAs transistor occurs at high collector current density.

The concept of effective frequency for various transistor structures is introduced and used for frequency propagation in complex circuits. Simple algorithms are presented for differentiating between simultaneous and nonsimultaneous currents using frequency, propagation delay, and power-bus location. Current flow is analyzed in general for three structures: interconnect, internal power buses, and pad-ring power buses. Individual transistor currents are related to total current in VLSI circuits. Current values and percentage errors are given to various examples. These current estimates can flag serious reliability issues, such as electromigration, or spurious signal noise from excessive power-bus voltage drops.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/697/00018618.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.18618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.18618","startPage":"520","endPage":"531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quick estimation of transient currents in CMOS integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18618/","displayDocTitle":"Quick estimation of transient currents in CMOS integrated circuits","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3410014","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quick estimation of transient currents in CMOS integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00018618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039309S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"9","articleId":"18618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":18626,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","volume":"77","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3424909","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00018626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044653S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"12566","articleId":"18626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":18627,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

The authors discuss their view and experiences in dealing with the modeling and interpretation problems. The key step is considered to be the modeling step, which is that of predicting the response of a given distribution of electrical properties within the Earth to the electromagnetic excitation. Decisions about modeling methods also consider the interpretation process that will be used. The electromagnetic problem is three-dimensional which makes it necessary to use numerical methods. Difference equations are used and the authors investigate spacing requirements and two approaches to solving the system of equations: a relaxation method and a direct solution method. The relaxation method is found to be much faster, but it is very difficult to eliminate all the errors in the resulting solution. The interpretation problem is approached using a scheme that minimizes the joint probability of fitting the observed data and adhering to an a priori conductivity model. A relaxation procedure is used to solve this problem and the behavior of the procedure is examined associated with the application of magnetotellurics to exploration problems. Some of the problems in signal resolution that arise when interpreting the data are noted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.18628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.18628","endPage":"333","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/698/00018628.pdf","startPage":"318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional magnetotelluric modelling and inversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18628/","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional magnetotelluric modelling and inversion","volume":"77","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3413617","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional magnetotelluric modelling and inversion","sourcePdf":"00018628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069507S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"76","articleId":"18628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":18642,"authors":[{"name":"X.T.

The problem treated is general in the sense that it accommodates the case where L of the N slots may be explicitly designated as prohibited and unavailable for assignment. This problem occurs in satellite transmission with many small carriers accessing the same transponder where, due to multipath and TV interference from crosspolarized transponders of the same satellite and from copolarized transponders of the adjacent satellites, some portions of the bandwidth of the considered transponder cannot be used. To permit comparison with respect to the intermodulation advantage and central-processing-unit time required, the case without prohibited slots is considered. The sequential insertion procedure in which, starting with two carriers at the two end slots, one additional carrier at a time is optimally inserted into one of the unassigned slots is found best when the ratio between the available bandwidth and the total carrier bandwidth is greater than about 125%. All the heuristic procedures produced assignments whose intermodulation advantages are all greater than the bandwidth ratio.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.18642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/699/00018642.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.18642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some practical strategies for reducing intermodulation in satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18642/","displayDocTitle":"Some practical strategies for reducing intermodulation in satellite communications","volume":"24","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3401833","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some practical strategies for reducing intermodulation in satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00018642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06559S","chronDate":"Nov.  1988","isNumber":"699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"14","articleId":"18642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":18659,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The incident sources can be a mixture of narrowband and broadband sources, and, the geometry of the array is unrestricted. The algorithm makes use of a fundamental property possessed by those eigenvectors of the array spectral density matrix that are associated with eigenvalues that are larger than the sensor noise level. Specifically, it is shown that these eigenvectors can each be represented as linear combinations of the steering vectors identifying the incident plane waves. This property is then used to solve the important special cases of incoherent sources incident on a general array and coherent sources incident on an equispaced linear array.

The joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm has been previously reported to be suitable for this problem in that it makes few assumptions and can handle many targets as long as the clutter density is not very high. However, the complexity of this algorithm increases rapidly with the number of targets and returns. An approximation of the JPDA that uses an analog computational network to solve the data association problem is suggested. The problem is viewed as that of optimizing a suitably chosen energy function. Simple neural-network structures for the approximate minimization of such functions have been proposed by other researchers. The analog network used offers a significant degree of parallelism and thus can compute the association probabilities more rapidly. Computer simulations indicate the ability of the algorithm to track many targets simultaneously in the presence of moderately dense clutter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.18666","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/700/00018666.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"108","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018666.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.18666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural solution to the multitarget tracking data association problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Neural solution to the multitarget tracking data association problem","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3410242","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural solution to the multitarget tracking data association problem","sourcePdf":"00018666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028847S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"79","articleId":"18666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":18669,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The time-domain algorithms are shown to be extremely efficient with respect to requirements on calculations and memory, and hence they are well suited to real-time systems where the Doppler estimation is based on raw SAR data. For offline processors where the Doppler estimation is performed on processed data, which removes the problem of partial coverage of bright targets, the Delta E estimator and the CDE (correlation Doppler estimator) algorithm give similar performance. However, for nonhomogeneous scenes it is found that the nonlinear SDE algorithm, which estimates the Doppler-shift on the basis of data signs alone, gives superior performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.18675","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"134","endPage":"140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/701/00018675.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018675.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.18675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating the Doppler centroid of SAR data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Frequency estimation","Doppler radar","Synthetic aperture radar","Real time systems","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised signal processing","Doppler effect","parameter estimation","radar theory","telecommunications computing","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler centroid","SAR data","frequency-domain techniques","synthetic-aperture radar","nonlinear time-domain algorithm","sign-Doppler estimator","SEASAT processor","real-time systems","offline processors","correlation Doppler estimator","Doppler-shift"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"Estimating the Doppler centroid of SAR data","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3420828","publicationDate":"March 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18675/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating the Doppler centroid of SAR data","sourcePdf":"00018675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025531S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"226","articleId":"18675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":18677,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

The nonparametric probabilist data association filter (PDAF) has been adapted for the multisensor (MS) case, yielding the MSPDAF. To accommodate the fact that the target can be highly maneuvering, the interacting multiple model (IMM) approach is used. The results of single-model-based filters and of the IMM/MSPDAF algorithm with two and three models are presented and compared. The IMM has been shown to be able to adapt itself to the type of motion exhibited by the target in the presence of heavy clutter. It yielded high accuracy in the absence of acceleration and kept the target in track during the high acceleration periods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Radar tracking","Infrared sensors","Filters","Acceleration","Radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infrared detectors","probability","radar clutter","signal detection","signal processing","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking","military systems","radar clutter","maneuvering target","highly maneuvering target","infrared sensor","nonparametric probabilist data association filter","multisensor","interacting multiple model","single-model-based filters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/7.18679","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018679.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/701/00018679.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.18679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisensor tracking of a maneuvering target in clutter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor tracking of a maneuvering target in clutter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18679/","volume":"25","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3410249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensor tracking of a maneuvering target in clutter","sourcePdf":"00018679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060383S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"126","articleId":"18679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":18685,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These all relate to time-of-arrival and cable delays. There are small range-dependent phase errors at the receiver outputs. The delays cause frequency shifts, which produce phase errors at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) outputs after ranging. These frequency shifts cause amplitude errors when the signals are resolved into the same range bin. Two methods of compensating for phase and amplitude errors are proposed. The first corrects for phase errors prior to beamforming. Amplitude errors are ignored but the residual error is usually small. The second method aligns the receiver frequencies digitally before ranging.

In the problem considered, a dense grid of rays is launched into the cavity through the opening. The rays bounce from the cavity walls based on the laws of geometrical optics and eventually exit the cavity via the aperture. The ray-bouncing method is based on tracking a large number of rays launched into the cavity through the opening and determining the geometrical optics field associated with each ray by taking into consideration: (1) the geometrical divergence factor, (2) polarization, and (3) material loading of the cavity walls. A physical optics scheme is then applied to compute the backscattered field from the exit rays. This method is so simple in concept that there is virtually no restriction on the shape or material loading of the cavity. Numerical results obtained by this method are compared with those for the modal analysis for a circular cylinder terminated by a PEC plate. RCS results for an S-bend circular cylinder generated on the Cray X-MP supercomputer show significant RCS reduction.

The composite material is modeled as planar lamina composed of undirectional collimated fibers with regular spacings between the elements. The fibers, perfectly or partially conductive, are assumed to be embedded in a resin matrix translucent to electromagnetic radiation. For the partially conductive case, the Schelkunoff Ansatz is used. The case of two-plied laminates with skewed fiber orientation is discussed. The mathematical formulation is based on the electric-field integral equation solved with an entire-domain Galerkin expansion. Results are obtained for laminates with both finite and infinite numbers of elements. For the latter, the Floquet-Galerkin solution for periodic structures is used. The effect of truncation of the panels is discussed for arbitrary angles of illumination. It is shown that in many cases implementation of the Floquet-Galerkin solution using diagonal system matrices yields accurate results for the nonspecular cross sections of the laminates. The theoretical results are confirmed by experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.18709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/702/00018709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.18709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=702","startPage":"219","endPage":"228","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018709.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering from composite materials: a first-order model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scattering from composite materials: a first-order model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3410029","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering from composite materials: a first-order model","sourcePdf":"00018709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02846S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"18709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":18710,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Uniformity of spectral peak width is necessary for accurate comparison of spectra. The desired frequency domain characteristics can be achieved through the application of tunable data windows prior to transformation. The I/sub o/-sinh (Kaiser), Gaussian, and cosine-taper (Tukey) windows were evaluated as to their ability to produce power spectra with uniform spectral peak width. Objective comparison of power spectra is based on the spectral parameter, which is a numerical index of power distribution. Application of the method to PRVEP waveforms of normal subjects and to a population of Alzheimer's disease patients showed the I/sub o/-sinh window to be the most effective method, yielding correct classification of all normal and abnormal subjects. The Gaussian window also performed well, with only two misclassifications. Use of the rectangular window resulted in seven misclassifications. The tapered-cosine window was very limited in its applicability, and was about equal in performance to the rectangular window.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.18750","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018750.png","startPage":"439","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.18750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=704","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/704/00018750.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive approach to spectral analysis of pattern-reversal visual potentials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18750/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive approach to spectral analysis of pattern-reversal visual potentials","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3393712","pubMedId":"2714823","publicationDate":"April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive approach to spectral analysis of pattern-reversal visual potentials","sourcePdf":"00018750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039406S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"14","articleId":"18750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":18757,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that with this field-proven system, data transmission at a rate of 90 Mb/s (two multiplexed DS-3 signals) is feasible in a transmission bandwidth of 30 MHz. Extensive operational satellite tests performed over the T-303 satellite of AT&T demonstrated a BER <10/sup -10/ and no errors for several days. The practical bandwidth efficiency of these SATCOM systems is 3 b/s/Hz, i.e. double the currently used 1.5 b/s/Hz QPSK (quadrature phase-shift keyed) systems. The doubling of the spectral efficiency is attained with advance modem (modulation-demodulation), adaptive equalization robust synchronization, high-power amplifier (HPA) linearization (predistortion), and low redundancy powerful forward-error-correction (FEC) subsystems. The systems may make possible the conversion of currently operational analog FM links into bandwidth efficient digital systems. In one 30 MHz satellite transponder three to four digitized high quality TV signals could be broadcast, or two standard rate DS-3 signals time-division multiplexed with a DS-1 rate signal and additional auxiliary data streams.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.18762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/705/00018762.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018762.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.18762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new generation of 90 Mb/s systems: bandwidth efficient, field tested 16-QAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18762/","displayDocTitle":"A new generation of 90 Mb/s systems: bandwidth efficient, field tested 16-QAM","volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3393563","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new generation of 90 Mb/s systems: bandwidth efficient, field tested 16-QAM","sourcePdf":"00018762.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054304S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"8","articleId":"18762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":18765,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The authors investigate the key factor that governs the effectiveness of a stirrer. By examining the fundamental properties associated with a perturbing body in a cavity, they find that the key to effective field perturbation lies in shifting the eigenmode frequencies. They illustrate this phenomenon by examining a two-dimensional cavity with a one-dimensional perturbing body. Using the transmission-line-matrix method, they compute the shifting of eigenfrequencies and examine the variation on the magnitude of the fields for different stirrer sizes. From this analysis, they draw an analogy between the action of a large stirrer and the effect of amplitude and frequency modulations. It is concluded that it is theoretically possible to simulate the stirrer by the external modulation of the input signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.18784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/706/00018784.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"169","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018784.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.18784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of an electrically large stirrer in a mode-stirred chamber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18784/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of an electrically large stirrer in a mode-stirred chamber","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3410217","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of an electrically large stirrer in a mode-stirred chamber","sourcePdf":"00018784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049052S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"60","articleId":"18784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":18786,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

Both techniques have been used for calculating the fields from lightning. A simple lightning return stroke current model, consisting of a square current pulse traveling up a vertical antenna above a ground plane, is used to compare the two techniques. Analytical expressions are obtained for the fields using each technique. These expressions are shown to be numerically equivalent, but the authors are unable to prove their equivalence analytically. It is concluded that the monopole and the dipole techniques can both be derived from Maxwell's equations and hence that both are correct. In attempting to dispel the apparent confusion that has existed regarding the validity of the monopole technique, the authors show that the monopole approach, as discussed in the literature, is applicable only to upward-traveling current waves and hence is not particularly useful in the realistic modeling of lightning return strokes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","volume":"31","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3410221","publicationDate":"May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Methods for calculating the electromagnetic fields from a known source distribution: application to lightning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods for calculating the electromagnetic fields from a known source distribution: application to lightning","sourcePdf":"00018788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042222S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"96","articleId":"18788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":18789,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

In these problems, source and field points are laterally rather than vertically separated with respect to the substrate. The conventional Sommerfeld integral and the plane wave spectral integral (PWS) representations of the microstrip Green's function converge very slowly in this case. However, the asymptotic closed-form representation of the Green's function does not have this limitation, and it remains accurate even for very small lateral separation between source and observation points. A modified form of the Sommerfeld integral representation is used only for observation points in the immediate vicinity of the source, while the asymptotic form is used elsewhere. Some numerical results based on this approach are presented and are shown to compare very well with previous results based on the corresponding exact-integral or PWS forms of the Green's function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.18838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/709/00018838.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.18838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=709","startPage":"669","endPage":"679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient analysis of planar microstrip geometries using a closed-form asymptotic representation of the grounded dielectric slab Green's function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient analysis of planar microstrip geometries using a closed-form asymptotic representation of the grounded dielectric slab Green's function","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18838/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3393626","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient analysis of planar microstrip geometries using a closed-form asymptotic representation of the grounded dielectric slab Green's function","sourcePdf":"00018838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047646S","chronDate":"Apr 1989","isNumber":"709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"44","articleId":"18838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":18845,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The module includes an MMIC voltage-controlled oscillator, an analog frequency divider, and interstage amplifiers. The constituent monolithic chips are integrated in a very small single-package module and operate at the target frequencies without any external trimming or matching network. The oscillator is tuned more than 1 GHz with a constant output amplitude. The frequency-divided output is also obtained over the whole tuning range. Spurious output is not found at any frequency up to 22 GHz. In spite of the very low-Q factor of GaAs monolithic circuitry, the oscillator phase noise exhibited is less than -80 dBc/Hz, due to the high-gain, high-speed phase lock.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/709/00018845.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.18845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.18845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=18845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact full MMIC module for Ku-band phase-locked oscillators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Microwave oscillators","Microwave integrated circuits","Monolithic integrated circuits","Frequency conversion","Circuit optimization","Tuning","Gallium arsenide","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave oscillators","MMIC","modules","packaging","phase-locked loops","tuning","variable-frequency oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLL","SHF","MMIC module","Ku-band","phase-locked oscillators","monolithic microwave integrated circuit","voltage-controlled oscillator","analog frequency divider","interstage amplifiers","single-package module","tuning range","22 GHz","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","displayDocTitle":"A compact full MMIC module for Ku-band phase-locked oscillators","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3393633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact full MMIC module for Ku-band phase-locked oscillators","sourcePdf":"00018845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07391S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","articleId":"18845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":18846,"authors":[{"name":"I.L.

Measurements in the 0.1-1 GHz frequency range show that the phase is shifted approximately 90 degrees and that the corresponding change in amplitude ranges from 43 dB at 0.1 GHz to 23 dB at 1 GHz when the illumination-induced conductance is switched from a low OFF-state value ( approximately 4*10/sup -8/ S) to a high ON-state value (5 mS). The observed characteristics can be described by a phase-shifting region and an amplitude modulation region. In the phase-shifting region the phase strongly depends on the conductance, and the amplitude is almost constant. In the amplitude modulation region both the amplitude and the phase depend on the conductance but the effect on the amplitude is much more pronounced. A lumped-element model describing the device performance is presented. It is concluded that these optoelectronic microwave switching devices are suitable for high-speed amplitude modulation but are not promising as high-speed phase shifter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.18846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.18846","startPage":"729","endPage":"733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/709/00018846.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase and amplitude characteristics of InP:Fe modified interdigitated gap photoconductive microwave switches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","displayDocTitle":"Phase and amplitude characteristics of InP:Fe modified interdigitated gap photoconductive microwave switches","publicationDate":"April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3393634","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18846/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase and amplitude characteristics of InP:Fe modified interdigitated gap photoconductive microwave switches","sourcePdf":"00018846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041857S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"12","articleId":"18846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":18854,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

A suitable method of B-H curve representation that is reliable in the dynamics computations is suggested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.18874","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/710/00018874.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00018874.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.18874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method for evaluation of transient states in saturated electric machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/18874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1989","displayDocTitle":"A novel method for evaluation of transient states in saturated electric machines","volume":"25","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3393957","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method for evaluation of transient states in saturated electric machines","sourcePdf":"00018874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022048S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1989","isNumber":"710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"37","articleId":"18874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":18879,"authors":[{"name":"J.

To evaluate the impact of the amorphous metal material in machine performance, the losses of the test machine were segregated. For purposes of comparison the core losses of the silicon iron motor were estimated using equations obtained empirically. At a speed of 48000 r/min, core losses in the amorphous metal machine were reduced by a factor of five compared to the silicon iron machine. The reduction in the core comprised 33% of total losses. The amorphous metal motor showed a six-point efficiency gain over the silicon iron machines.

The cumulative failure data showed that the MLC failures occurred in several stages during the THB test, with the extent of failures depending on the quality of the capacitor lot and the bias voltage. THB failures increased after some of the MLC lots had undergone a barrel-plating operation, indicating moisture penetration and ionic contaminants as the likely cause of accelerating the failure rate. In the cross section of failed MLC, the authors observed large holes caused by high-temperature explosive events occurring inside the MLC. There were also internal cracks connecting electrodes of opposite polarity, with silver inclusions along the length of the cracks. These observations strongly suggested that silver migration was the cause of short-circuit paths, leading to subsequent failure of the MLC.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/33.19027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/720/00019027.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"137","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019027.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.19027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation of silver migration with temperature-humidity-bias (THB) failures in multilayer ceramic capacitors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","displayDocTitle":"Correlation of silver migration with temperature-humidity-bias (THB) failures in multilayer ceramic capacitors","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3394063","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation of silver migration with temperature-humidity-bias (THB) failures in multilayer ceramic capacitors","sourcePdf":"00019027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047608S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"50","articleId":"19027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":19037,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Even 100% single-stuck fault coverage may not guarantee adequate quality. Results are presented that extend previous work and show that for high required IC quality, process yield has a negligible effect on required test thoroughness. The extensions consist of: removing the assumption of a one-to-one correspondence between chip defects and single-stuck faults; demonstrating that for high quality levels the dependence of quality on test coverage is linear rather than exponential and that for high yields, the dependence of quality on yield is also linear; and showing that the yield used in the calculations should be functional rather than die yield. The theoretical results are compared with data obtained from measurements at a production IC facility.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit testing","Manufacturing","Sampling methods","Packaging","Circuit testing","Digital integrated circuits","Production","Assembly","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing","quality control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC quality","test transparency","single-stuck fault coverage","chip defects"]}],"doi":"10.1109/41.19069","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019069.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/723/00019069.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.19069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IC quality and test transparency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IC quality and test transparency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19069/","volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3408003","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IC quality and test transparency","sourcePdf":"00019069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041587S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","articleId":"19069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":19071,"authors":[{"name":"C.F.

These are examined for commonly used analog functions, and the results culminate in an architecture for testable mixed analog and digital circuits. The architecture is designed to solve the problems associated with testing basic circuit configurations for different types of commonly used analog macros. Using the recommended architecture to gain access to control and observation test points in the analog portions of the mixed analog/digital ASIC, a series of analog test tables for several different analog functions have been derived. The analog test procedures are independent of any digital design for testability that might be used in the digital portions of the ASIC. General testing procedures for current analog/digital ASICs are described along with desirable characteristics for testers for this type of circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.19072","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019072.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/723/00019072.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.19072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"219","endPage":"226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog/digital ASIC design for testability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Analog/digital ASIC design for testability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19072/","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3408005","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog/digital ASIC design for testability","sourcePdf":"00019072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028011S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","articleId":"19072","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":19073,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

A 4 Mb RAM can be tested by the proposed algorithm several thousand times faster than the conventional sequential algorithms for detecting pattern-sensitive faults. The test speedup has been achieved by writing a test data simultaneously over many cells, and the stored data are tested simultaneously by a parallel comparator and error detector in a read operation. The existing RAM architecture has been modified very little so that the proposed technique can be implemented very easily even in switched-capacitor DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) with low intercell pitch width.

Experimental results on using these etalons for optical channel tuning in a multiwavelength WDM optical communication system are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.19087","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/724/00019087.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"624","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019087.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.19087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angle-tuned etalon filters for optical channel selection in high density wavelength division multiplexed systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19087/","displayDocTitle":"Angle-tuned etalon filters for optical channel selection in high density wavelength division multiplexed systems","volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3392984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angle-tuned etalon filters for optical channel selection in high density wavelength division multiplexed systems","sourcePdf":"00019087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054759S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"38","articleId":"19087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":19103,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

A bit error rate (BER) floor of 3*10/sup -4/ is observed when the channels are spaced by 200 MHz, FSK modulation at 45 Mb/s, and when the optical input signal is large enough such that the gain is compressed by 2 dB relative to its small-signal value. The receiver is substantially improved by reducing the optical power amplifier input. However, the sensitivity increases only to a maximum value beyond which it degrades as the optical power of the demodulated channel becomes small relative to the noise of the optical amplifier. The combined effect of the crosstalk and the amplifier noise yields an optimum sensitivity of 250 photons/b for BER=10/sup -9/. This result is 5 dB poorer than the sensitivity obtained in the absence of an optical amplifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.19111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.19111","startPage":"759","endPage":"765","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/725/00019111.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=725","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019111.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk degradation caused by optical amplification in a multichannel FSK heterodyne system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1989","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk degradation caused by optical amplification in a multichannel FSK heterodyne system","publicationDate":"May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3409079","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19111/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk degradation caused by optical amplification in a multichannel FSK heterodyne system","sourcePdf":"00019111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143732S","chronDate":"May  1989","isNumber":"725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","articleId":"19111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":19115,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

The transient enclosure voltage and measures to reduce it are analyzed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.19208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.19208","endPage":"233","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019208.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/730/00019208.pdf","startPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very fast transients in GIS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19208/","displayDocTitle":"Very fast transients in GIS","volume":"4","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3395366","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very fast transients in GIS","sourcePdf":"00019208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046237S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"149","articleId":"19208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":19222,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A high voltage, self-healing current-limiting element (CLE) using sodium has been developed as a functional part of the CLD. The CLE has a rating of 3.6 kV and 500 A and can limit a fault current of 20 kA, RMS (50 kA, p) to less than 23 kA, p. Computer simulations for evaluating the feasibility of the CLE have been carried out for a CLD with a CLE installed in the bus-tie section of a 66/6.6 kV distribution substation. It has been shown that parallel connection of transformers becomes feasible without replacing the existing equipment, since the short circuit capacity of any fault point on the secondary side of the transformer can be reduced below the stress capability of the equipment (150 MVA, or 32 kA, p at 6.6 kV).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Current limiters","Transformers","Cross layer design","Substations","Circuit faults","Computer simulation","Stress","Switchgear","Short circuit currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformers","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer simulations","high voltage","self-healing current limiting element","operating parameters","distribution substations","current-limiting device","transformers","load capacity","bus-tie section","short circuit capacity","3.6 kV","500 A","20 kA","23 kA","66 kV","6.6 kV","150 MVA","32 kA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19222","doi":"10.1109/61.19222","startPage":"342","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/730/00019222.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=730","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019222.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.19222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19222/","displayDocTitle":"Development of high voltage, self-healing current limiting element and verification of its operating parameters as a CLD for distribution substations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3395379","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of high voltage, self-healing current limiting element and verification of its operating parameters as a CLD for distribution substations","sourcePdf":"00019222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058393S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"10","articleId":"19222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":19248,"authors":[{"name":"G.T.

The solution algorithm developed for the capacitor sizing problem is based on a Phase I-Phase II feasible directions approach. Novel power flow equations and a solution method, called DistFlow, for radial distribution systems are introduced. The method is computationally efficient and numerically robust, especially for distribution systems with large r/x ratio branches. DistFlow is used repeatedly as a subroutine in the optimization algorithm for the capacitor sizing problem.

Pictures can be of front or rear views. The algorithms cope with the possibility of using remote controlled cameras. This means that the system includes features which are able to re-calibrate the algorithms and to detect the lanes if an operator has moved the camera. Different luminance and traffic conditions are considered. Emphases are made upon the new 'lane detection' module and analysis of dense traffic and nocturnal traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Road Traffic Monitoring, 1989.","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on Road Traffic Monitoring, 1989.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1237/731/00019294.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=731","startPage":"84","endPage":"88","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00019294.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TITAN: a traffic measurement system using image processing techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"TITAN: a traffic measurement system using image processing techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Feb 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19294/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Feb. 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3351465","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TITAN: a traffic measurement system using image processing techniques","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00019294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031077S","chronDate":"7-9 Feb 1989","isNumber":"731","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1237","citationCount":"20","articleId":"19294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":19339,"authors":[{"name":"S.Z.

The two types of processors are functionally specialized for the different components of the work load found in a departmental setting. The Cydra 5 numeric processor, based on a directed-data-flow architecture, provides consistently high performance on a broader class of numerical computations. The interactive processors offload all nonnumeric work from the numeric processor, leaving it free to spend all its time on the numeric application. The I/O processors permit high-bandwidth I/O transitions with minimal involvement from the interactive or numeric processors. The system architecture and data-flow architecture are described. The numeric processor decisions and tradeoffs are examined, and the main memory system is discussed.

The algorithm presented was implemented in a series of Fortran programs, and the results obtained using this procedure compare very well with available theoretical and experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/788/00019902.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.19902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.19902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=788","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element method applied to modeling crosstalk problems on printed circuit boards","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Crosstalk","Electromagnetic modeling","Printed circuits","Multiconductor transmission lines","Transmission line theory","Distributed parameter circuits","Electromagnetic coupling","Predictive models","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout","crosstalk","finite element analysis","FORTRAN","printed circuit design","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk modelling","VHF","UHF","EM coupling","printed circuit boards","distributed parameter transmission line model","electromagnetic coupling","crosstalk voltages","multiconductor configuration","finite element method","modal analysis","radiation model","radiated field","algorithm","Fortran programs","30 to 1000 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","displayDocTitle":"Finite element method applied to modeling crosstalk problems on printed circuit boards","volume":"31","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3354696","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element method applied to modeling crosstalk problems on printed circuit boards","sourcePdf":"00019902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046186S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"45","articleId":"19902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":19933,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The OR gate is a two-junction interferometer with one magnetically coupled control line. Magnetic coupling and current injection are used to switch the logic state of the gate. By optimizing the gate parameters, an operating margin of +or-43% and a switching speed of 2.5 ps/gate are obtained. the gate area is 30 mu m*24 mu m with a 1.5- mu m minimum junction diameter. The gate family consists of an OR gate, a single-junction AND gate, and a timed inverter (TI) that consists of the OR gate, a junction, and resistors. The delay time of the gate operated in the actual circuit was found to be less than 10 ps. Circuits having up to 1000 gates, the critical path model of a 16-bit*16-bit multiplier, and a 16-bit arithmetic logic unit have been successfully operated. When the Josephson gate is operated with three-phase power, it is possible to construct any sequential circuit without the complex latch circuit required to prevent the race condition for one- or two-phase power supplies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1989","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3375724","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Josephson modified variable threshold logic gates for use in ultra-high-speed LSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Josephson modified variable threshold logic gates for use in ultra-high-speed LSI","sourcePdf":"00019947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084606S","chronDate":"Feb 1989","isNumber":"789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"45","articleId":"19947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":19957,"authors":[{"name":"H.-S.

An on-chip noble metal counterelectrode serves as the electrical contact to define the electric potential of the electrolyte. No external reference electrode is required. The difference measurement technique achieves (1) common-mode rejection of the solution potential, and (2) relaxation of the requirement that the on-chip reference electrode be ideal. The CMOS-compatible ISFET process is modified from a standard self-aligned polysilicon gate CMOS process with minimal process redesign. The standard CMOS sequence is unaltered until the contact windows are opened.

Two-dimensional/two-carrier device simulation revealed the following advantages. An n-channel MOSFET with 500-AA-SOI thickness exhibited a high-punchthrough resistance as well as an improved subthreshold swing down to a deep submicrometer region, even if the film was nearly intrinsic. A capacitance coupling model has been proposed to explain these subthreshold characteristics. The kink elimination effect, which was attributed to a significantly reduced hole density in the SOI film, was reproduced. The low-field channel mobility exhibited a significant increase, which was ascribed to a decrease in the vertical electric field. Moreover, the current-overshoot phenomenon associated with the switching operation was suppressed. Excess holes recombine with electrons quickly after the gate turn-on, bringing about a stabilized potential in the SOI substrate. Experiments were also carried out to verify the simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/790/00019959.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.19959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.19959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=19959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional simulation and measurement of high-performance MOSFETs made on a very thin SOI film","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Substrates","Electrical resistance measurement","Charge carrier processes","Transconductance","Doping","Silicon on insulator technology","Very large scale integration","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models","semiconductor-insulator boundaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D simulation model","SOI MOSFETs","2D two carrier simulation","thin SOI film","device characteristics","n-channel MOSFET","high-punchthrough resistance","improved subthreshold swing","capacitance coupling model","subthreshold characteristics","kink elimination effect","reduced hole density","low-field channel mobility","vertical electric field","current-overshoot phenomenon","switching operation","500 A","Si-SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/19959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional simulation and measurement of high-performance MOSFETs made on a very thin SOI film","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3375734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional simulation and measurement of high-performance MOSFETs made on a very thin SOI film","sourcePdf":"00019959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041027S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"116","articleId":"19959","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":19960,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.
