In particular, it is focused on the proposal and experimental evaluation of a low-cost and high precision timestamping technique based on Ultra Wide Band (UWB) signalling. In recent years, the use of such systems has gained an increasing success thanks to their robustness to interferers and multipath. In this paper a new hybrid wireless node is proposed; a traditional IEEE802.15.4 radio, the reference physical layer for wireless sensor networks, is supported by an UWB transceiver. The former is used for communication purposes and allows to preserve compatibility with already installed infrastructures/networks; the latter is used for time of arrival estimation. Hardware prototypes have been realized and experimental tests have shown a sub-nanosecond accuracy. A comparison with commercial solutions has shown a performance improvement with respect to conventional approaches.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Receivers","Protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Accuracy","Transceivers","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio transceivers","time-of-arrival estimation","ultra wideband communication","wireless sensor networks","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-precision UWB-based timestamping","time synchronization","wireless networks","low-cost high precision timestamping","ultra wide band signalling","IEEE802.15.4 radio","reference physical layer","wireless sensor networks","UWB transceiver","time of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["synchronization","wireless sensor network","distributed systems","UWB systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPCS.2011.6070150","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062352/6070140/06070150.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6070140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCS.2011.6070150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-precision UWB-based timestamping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-precision UWB-based timestamping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070150/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070150/","accessionNumber":"12358303","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-precision UWB-based timestamping","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569458305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082347S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062352","isNumber":"6070140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062352","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6070140","articleId":"6070150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6070154,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Laner","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Laner","id":"37392213000"},{"name":"Sebastian Caban","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Caban","id":"37300758800"},{"name":"Philipp Svoboda","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Svoboda","id":"37407984900"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-893-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-892-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-0313"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-0305"},{"format":"CD","value":"1949-0305"}],"articleNumber":"6070154","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"abstract":"Time synchronization is a vital requirement for various applications. Especially the synchronization of desktop computers to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) yields numerous use cases, such as distributed measurements. Several solutions address this need, at different levels of price and accuracy. In this work we evaluate on the achievable precision in time synchronization of a desktop PC, for example, assisted by a low-budget GPS receiver. This is achieved by a novel measurement setup, which is comparing the software synchronized internal clock of the PC to a rubidium frequency standard. Our results show, that the synchronization offsets of the software clocks of all tested PCs have positive mean (time lag) in the order of 10 \u03bcs. The respective standard deviation is typically an order of magnitude lower. Thereby the unknown interrupt latency is the limiting factor for the accuracy. With this work we show that today (2011) 10 \u03bcs of precision can be achieve at very low cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Accuracy","Global Positioning System","Software measurement","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","microcomputers","statistical analysis","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time synchronization","desktop computer","coordinated universal time","GPS receiver","Global Positioning System","software synchronized internal clock","rubidium frequency standard","software clock","standard deviation","interrupt latency","time 10 mus"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPCS.2011.6070154","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control and Communication","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062352/6070140/06070154.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6070140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCS.2011.6070154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time synchronization performance of desktop computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time synchronization performance of desktop computers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070154/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070154/","accessionNumber":"12358307","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time synchronization performance of desktop computers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"1569458401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088394S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062352","isNumber":"6070140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062352","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6070140","articleId":"6070154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6070186,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Paul Pham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Paul","lastName":"Pham","id":"38015773600"},{"name":"N.

It utilizes voltage and current transient signals generated during an islanding event to detect the formation of the island. A Decision Tree classifier is trained to categorize the transient generating events as `islanding' or `non-islanding'. It involves two basic stages of signal processing to extract the required feature vectors for the classification. The first stage involves signal filtering and in the second stage signals are processed by rectifying, summing, and low-pass filtering to get the energy content in the three phases during a selected time-frame. Analog filters, rectifiers, adders and micro-controllers complete the implementation. The performance of the design was tested with signals generated using a real-time waveform playback instrument. A simple radial medium voltage distribution system with single distributed generator was simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC to obtain the transient waveforms. The experimental and simulation results give comparable results showing high accuracy in detecting islanding events very fast.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070186/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12358353","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070186/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of an islanding detection approach based on current and voltage transients","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of an islanding detection approach based on current and voltage transients","confLoc":"Winnipeg, MB, Canada","sourcePdf":"p152pham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087303S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062557","isNumber":"6070174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062557","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6070174","articleId":"6070186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6070222,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to achieve minimum energy demand from electric mains, the genetic algorithm is used as the optimization method. The system behavior is modeled using neural networks as a surrogate model to formulate the mapping between the variables and the objective. Matlab Simulink model is used to generate the training and test sets for the neural network algorithm. Furthermore an Energy-management strategy based on a frequency approach is used for the on-board energy storage of trains. Based on this strategy the share of every on-board storage source (flywheel/battery) is specified. It is shown that application of the proposed method and optimum arrangement of ultra-capacitors leads to a considerable reduction of consumed energy, improvement of DC voltage profile, reduction of substation's peak current and also reduction of network losses. The method is highly effective when the electric system becomes more and more complex.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070226/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12358393","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070226/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applying neural network and genetic algorithm for optimal placement of ultra-capacitors in metro systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying neural network and genetic algorithm for optimal placement of ultra-capacitors in metro systems","confLoc":"Winnipeg, MB, Canada","sourcePdf":"p35jalalikashani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063102S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062557","isNumber":"6070174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062557","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6070174","articleId":"6070226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6070260,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofang Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of New Energy Power System, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaofang Chen was born in Fujian Province, China.

Due to its special structure, MMC presents different fault performances compared with conventional voltage source converter (VSC). Considering the serious consequences brought out by the faults on the MMC converter terminal bus and DC side, it is necessary to analyze the fault characteristics deeply to design reasonable protection to improve the reliability of system and reduce the economic cost. In this paper, the performances principally under the single-phase to ground internal AC bus fault and DC line to ground fault with their corresponding protection requirements of MMC are investigated particularly based on the detailed electro-magnetic transient simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results verify fault mechanisms of MMC and show that the MMC-HVDC transmission system has better fault controllability than conventional VSC-HVDC.","doi":"10.1109/EPEC.2011.6070260","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062557/6070174/06070260.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EPEC.2011.6070260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6070174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the fault characteristics of HVDC based on modular multilevel converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070260/","displayDocTitle":"Research on the fault characteristics of HVDC based on modular multilevel converter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358427","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070260/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on the fault characteristics of HVDC based on modular multilevel converter","confLoc":"Winnipeg, MB, Canada","sourcePdf":"p91chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044688S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062557","isNumber":"6070174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062557","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6070174","articleId":"6070260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6070269,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Forestiere","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Forestiere","id":"37569736800"},{"name":"Antonio Maffucci","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automazione, Elettromagnetismo, Ingegneria dellInformazione, Matematica Industriale, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Maffucci","id":"37275604800"},{"name":"Giovanni Miano","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Miano","id":"37275613200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-125X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0085"}],"articleNumber":"6070269","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes","Integrated circuit modeling","Integrated circuit interconnections","Electron devices","Electrodynamics","Quantum capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","equivalent circuits","interconnections","nanoelectronics","nanotube devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conducting channels","multiwall carbon nanotubes","equivalent circuit models","electrical nanointerconnects","innovative material","single CNT shell","chirality","temperature 293 K to 298 K","C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)","conducting channels","nanoelectronics","nanointerconnects"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070269","abstract":"The correct evaluation of the number of conducting channels in multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is essential in view of the derivation of accurate equivalent circuit models for electrical nanointerconnects made by this innovative material.

The coordination strategy is based on modified version of the artificial ant system. The covered area is marked with amount of pheromone. The kind of pheromone causes repulsion of robots. They are directed to unexplored regions and the regions that were not recently explored for accomplishment cooperative tasks as exploration and surveillance. Previously, application of the strategy confirmed that exploration and surveillance general behaviors emerge from the individual agent behavior. The strategy is able to adapt the current system dynamics if the number of robots or the environment structure or both change. Three approaches relied on variation of pheromone releasing are presented for comparison as well as two mechanisms for steering adjusting. As performance criterion for patrolling, it is considered the time gap between two visits of the same region. Experiments results demonstrate that different configurations of strategies affect exploration and surveillance behaviors. The results show the performance of proposed approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062350/6070290/06070332.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 5th International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS)","doi":"10.1109/ICCIS.2011.6070332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIS.2011.6070332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6070290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired coordination of multiple robots systems and stigmergy mechanims to cooperative exploration and surveillance tasks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Surveillance","Robot kinematics","Silicon","Navigation","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired coordination","multiple robot systems","stigmergy mechanism","cooperative exploration strategy","surveillance tasks","distributed strategy","mobile robot team","artificial ant system","pheromone variation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired coordination of multiple robots systems and stigmergy mechanims to cooperative exploration and surveillance tasks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070332/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356863","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired coordination of multiple robots systems and stigmergy mechanims to cooperative exploration and surveillance tasks","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"rp420209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061197S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062350","isNumber":"6070290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062350","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6070290","articleId":"6070332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6070338,"authors":[{"name":"Samantha Denise F.

Thanks to the learning capability of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NN), stable adaptive NN tracking controller is designed for the uncertain ship dynamics. Partial persistent excitation (PE) condition of some internal signals in the closed-loop system is satisfied during tracking control to a periodic reference trajectory. Under PE condition, the designed adaptive NN controller is shown to be capable of learning of the uncertain ship dynamics in the stable control process. Subsequently, neural learning control using the knowledge obtained from deterministic learning is constructed to achieve closed-loop stability and improved control performance. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070359/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12356890","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070359/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning control of uncertain ocean surface ship dynamics using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning control of uncertain ocean surface ship dynamics using neural networks","confLoc":"Qingdao","sourcePdf":"rp690204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073983S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062350","isNumber":"6070290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062350","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6070290","articleId":"6070359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6070390,"authors":[{"name":"Harald St\u00f6rrle","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modeling, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"St\u00f6rrle","id":"38497912000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1247-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1246-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1244-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-6106"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-6092"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-6092"}],"articleNumber":"6070390","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Unified modeling language","Analytical models","Visualization","Humans","Accuracy","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","formal verification","software quality","systems analysis","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layout quality","UML diagram understanding","diagram visual qualities","life cycle phases","requirements analysis models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070390","abstract":"Practical experience suggests that use and understanding of UML diagrams is greatly affected by the quality of their layout. However, existing experimental evidence for this effect is been weak and inconclusive. In this paper, we explore two explanations. Firstly, we observe that the visual qualities of diagrams are more prominent in earlier life cycle phases so that the impact of layout quality should be more apparent in models and diagram types used there, an aspect not studied in previous research. Secondly, in practice, good layouts use many different heuristics simultaneously whereas previous research considered them in isolation only. In this paper, we report the results of a series of controlled experiments using compound layouts on requirements analysis models. With very high significance, we find a notable impact of the layout quality measured by different aspects of cognitive load.","doi":"10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070390","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059237/6070364/06070390.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6070364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact of layout quality to understanding UML diagrams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the impact of layout quality to understanding UML diagrams","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12358448","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070390/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070390/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"18-22 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact of layout quality to understanding UML diagrams","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"S07Paper2Storrle.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071913S","chronDate":"18-22 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059237","isNumber":"6070364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059237","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6070364","articleId":"6070390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6070396,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e1come Cunha","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Portugal"],"firstName":"J\u00e1come","lastName":"Cunha","id":"37605169700"},{"name":"Jorge Mendes","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Mendes","id":"38019074000"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Saraiva","affiliation":["Universidade do Minho, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Saraiva","id":"37287527500"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Paulo Fernandes","affiliation":["Universidade do Porto, Portugal","Universidade do Minho, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o Paulo","lastName":"Fernandes","id":"37272143500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1247-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1246-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1244-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-6106"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-6092"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-6092"}],"articleNumber":"6070396","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070396","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Unified modeling language","Object oriented modeling","Atmospheric modeling","Synchronization","Visualization","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","spreadsheet programs","visual programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spreadsheet model embedding","spreadsheet model evolution","ClassSheet model","business logic","model-driven spreadsheet engineering"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the embedding of ClassSheet models in spreadsheet systems.

Thus the comparatively accurate error model of azimuth is obtained to compensate the output of electronic compass. This method not only has strong nonlinear approximation capability, but also overcomes the neural networks' shortcomings which are too slow convergence speed, oscillation, and easy to fall into local optimum and sensitive to the initial values.

The goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of disruptions in communication services in response to large-scale external disturbances such as hurricanes. In particular, Hurricane Ike is drawn as a case study, and heterogeneous data is obtained from networks, storm, and system administrators. Using the data, we first study network-wide disruptions and dependences among different unreachable subnets. Our findings show that 120 out of 230 subnets in our data set were unreachable, among which 88 subnets became unreachable dependently at a time scale of seconds or less than three minutes. We then study dependencies between communication service-disruptions and external factors such as weather and power. Unreachable subnets are found to be weakly correlated with the storm. Power outages and lack of spare power are reported to be certain causes of communication disruptions. New research issues emerge for information acquisition across communication and power infrastructures as well as weather, and information sharing among organizations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070520/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12425118","publicationDate":"December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6070520/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Network-Service Disruption: Dependencies and External Factors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Network-Service Disruption: Dependencies and External Factors","sourcePdf":"375-tnsm1112-erjong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192597S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6102274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6102274","articleId":"6070520","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6070943,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Stefanini","affiliation":["Xlim/UMR6172, University of Limoges/CNRS, Limoges, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/6075219/6070943/6070943-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Romain Stefanini received the Master's degree in circuits, systems, and micro and nanotechnology for optical and high-frequency communications from the University of Limoges, Limoges, France, and the Engineering degree from the National School of Engineering of Limoges, Limoges, France, in 2008.

Furthermore, 10-20 element back-to-back switch arrays are developed and result in a marked improvement in the reliability of the overall switching device. A series-shunt design is also demonstrated with greatly improved isolation.

This setting is strictly competitive and can be related to perfectly competitive market models. In such models, general equilibrium theory is used to determine equilibrium measures that are Pareto optimal. First, we consider the links to be consumers that can trade goods within themselves. The goods in our setting correspond to beamforming vectors. We utilize the conflict representation of the consumers in the Edgeworth box, a graphical tool that depicts the allocation of the goods for the two consumers, to provide closed-form solution to all Pareto optimal outcomes. Afterwards, we model the situation between the links as a competitive market which additionally defines prices for the goods. The equilibrium in this economy is called Walrasian and corresponds to the prices that equate the demand to the supply of goods. We calculate the unique Walrasian equilibrium and propose a coordination process that is realized by an arbitrator which distributes the Walrasian prices to the consumers. The consumers then calculate in a decentralized manner their optimal demand corresponding to beamforming vectors that achieve the Walrasian equilibrium. This outcome is Pareto optimal and dominates the noncooperative outcome of the systems. Thus, based on the game theoretic model and solution concept, an algorithm for a distributed implementation of the beamforming problem in multiple-input single-output interference channels is provided.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2174962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6167334","startPage":"151","endPage":"164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6167334/06070948.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exchange Economy in Two-User Multiple-Input Single-Output Interference Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6070948/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exchange Economy in Two-User Multiple-Input Single-Output Interference Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578200","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exchange Economy in Two-User Multiple-Input Single-Output Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"jstsp-mochaourab-2174962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110346S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6167334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6167334","articleId":"6070948","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6070950,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Krongold","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Center of Energy Efficient Telecommunications, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Krongold","id":"37284936700"},{"name":"Timo Pfau","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Pfau","id":"37321336700"},{"name":"Noriaki Kaneda","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Noriaki","lastName":"Kaneda","id":"37272628700"},{"name":"Sian Chong Jeffrey Lee","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sian Chong Jeffrey","lastName":"Lee","id":"38240923900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6070950","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1571},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"Polarization-switched quadrature phase-shift keying (PS-QPSK) is a recently introduced 4-D signal constellation that has a power efficiency (and sensitivity) advantage over polarization-division multiplexed QPSK (PDM-QPSK). Using a polarization-rotated form of PS-QPSK, we show that it is equivalent to a short block code, and assert that basic information theory explains its advantage over PDM-QPSK. We consider the practicality of PS-QPSK by considering its performance after a forward error correction (FEC) is applied, as this is the true measure of a modulation format's power efficiency. When fairly compared with the same data rate, bandwidth, and transmit power, simulations show that PS-QPSK is actually not as efficient as PDM-QPSK when a sufficient FEC is applied to achieve the very low BERs required in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/6126857/06070950.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2011.2174978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2011.2174978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison Between PS-QPSK and PDM-QPSK With Equal Rate and Bandwidth","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Bandwidth","Forward error correction","Encoding","Optics","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","forward error correction","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization-switched quadrature phase-shift keying","PS-QPSK","polarization-division multiplexed QPSK","PDM-QPSK","equal rate","equal bandwidth","4D signal constellation","power efficiency","short block code","information theory","forward error correction","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent detection","polarization multiplexing","polarization-switched quadrature phase-shift keying (PS-QPSK)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison Between PS-QPSK and PDM-QPSK With Equal Rate and Bandwidth","volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6070950/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12472034","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison Between PS-QPSK and PDM-QPSK With Equal Rate and Bandwidth","sourcePdf":"lpt-krongold-2174978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038081S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6126857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6126857","articleId":"6070950","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6070984,"authors":[{"name":"Youngkil Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6139293/6070984/6070984-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youngkil Choi (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

A class-D amplifier for direct battery hookup must have a sufficiently high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) in preparation for noise, such as when a global system for mobile communications (GSM) bursts ripples through the system power line. This amplifier has a high PSRR of 88 dB for 217-Hz power supply ripples, using a third-order loop filter. System performance and stability are improved by applying the design technique of input-feedforward delta-sigma (\u0394\u03a3) modulators to the pulse-width modulation (PWM) class-D amplifier. A filterless method that can remove the external LC filter is employed, which offers great advantages in terms of PCB space and system cost. This amplifier achieves a power efficiency of 85.5% while delivering an output power of 750 mW into an 8-\u03a9 load from a 3.7-V supply voltage. Maximum achieved output power at 1% total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) from a 4.9-V supply voltage into an 8-\u03a9 load is 1.15 W. This class-D amplifier is designed to have a broad operational range of 2.7-4.9 V for the direct use of mobile phone battery power. It has a total area of 1.01 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and achieves a THD+N of 0.018%.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6139293/06070984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139293","startPage":"454","endPage":"463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.018% THD+N, 88-dB PSRR PWM Class-D Amplifier for Direct Battery Hookup","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 0.018% THD+N, 88-dB PSRR PWM Class-D Amplifier for Direct Battery Hookup","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12487874","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6070984/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.018% THD+N, 88-dB PSRR PWM Class-D Amplifier for Direct Battery Hookup","sourcePdf":"jssc-roh-2170770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087005S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6139293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6139293","articleId":"6070984","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6070985,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Center of Optical and Electromagnetic Research, The State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instruments, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shun-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086802494"},{"name":"Zhizhang David Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhizhang David","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278564400"},{"name":"Yi-qiang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada","East China Jiao Tong University, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Yi-qiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37405458200"},{"name":"Wen-Yan Yin","affiliation":["Center of Optical and Electromagnetic Research, The State Key Laboratory of Modern Optical Instruments, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Yan","lastName":"Yin","id":"37278303000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6070985","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":911},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Memory management","Wireless communication","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconditionally stable one-step leapfrog ADI-FDTD method","alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain method","substep computation","computational expenditure","electromagnetic problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational electromagnetics","efficiency","leapfrog alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time- domain (ADI-FDTD) method","unconditional stability"]}],"abstract":"One of the major hurdles that prevent the recently developed alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time- domain (ADT-FDTD) method from being widely used is its relatively large computational expenditures due to its sub-step computations.

It is found that the one-step method requires less amount of memory and CPU time than the current unconditionally stable FDTD methods and the similar memory requirement and less CPU time (when the time step is chosen to be adequately large) than the conventional FDTD method. In other words, when the unconditionally stable FDTD methods are required to solve electromagnetic problems, one is strongly recommended to use the one-step leapfrog method presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Unconditionally Stable One-Step Leapfrog ADI-FDTD Method and Its Comparisons With Other FDTD Methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2011.2173182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/6076819/06070985.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2011.2173182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6070985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6070985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"The Unconditionally Stable One-Step Leapfrog ADI-FDTD Method and Its Comparisons With Other FDTD Methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12403868","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Unconditionally Stable One-Step Leapfrog ADI-FDTD Method and Its Comparisons With Other FDTD Methods","sourcePdf":"lmwc-chen-2173182-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042424S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6076819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"41","articleId":"6070985","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6070988,"authors":[{"name":"Humberto Lobato-Morales","affiliation":["Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Humberto","lastName":"Lobato-Morales","id":"38274512300"},{"name":"Alonso Corona-Chavez","affiliation":["Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Alonso","lastName":"Corona-Chavez","id":"38274032700"},{"name":"Tatsuo Itoh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tatsuo","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37279606000"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 L.

The approach is a phase-based model that allows computation with sub-pixel accuracy. The algorithm uses a robust multi-scale and multi-orientation method that optimizes the estimation extraction with respect to the local image structure support. With respect to the state of the art, our work increases the on-chip power of computation compared to previous approaches in order to obtain a good accuracy of results with a large disparity range. In addition, our approach is specially suited for unconstrained environments applications thanks to the robustness of the phase information, capable of dealing with severe illumination changes and with small affine deformation between the image pair. This work also includes the rectification images circuitry in order to exploit the epipolar constraints on the chip. The dedicated circuit can rectify and process images of VGA resolution at a frame rate of 57 fps. The implementation uses a fine pipelined method (also with superscalar units) and multiple user defined parameters that lead to a high working frequency and a good adaptability to different scenarios. In the paper, we present different results and we compare them with state of the art approaches.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6257480/06071001.pdf","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Architecture for a Robust Multi-Scale Stereo Engine on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2172007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6257480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2172007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Architecture for a Robust Multi-Scale Stereo Engine on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"02 August 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"12904073","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6071001/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Architecture for a Robust Multi-Scale Stereo Engine on FPGA","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tomasi-2172007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133505S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6257480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6257480","articleId":"6071001","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6071003,"authors":[{"name":"Imdad Ali Rizvi","affiliation":["Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6079321/6071003/6071003-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Imdad Ali Rizvi received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electronics engineering from the University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India, in 2000 and 2004, respectively.

The problem of nonlinear separability of classes in a feature space consisting of spectral/spatial/textural features is addressed by kernel-based nonlinear mapping of the feature vectors. This facilitates use of linear discriminant functions for classification as used in artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this paper, performance of a recently introduced kernel called cloud basis function (CBF) is investigated with some modification for classification. The CBF has demonstrated superior performance to the tune of about 4% higher classification accuracy compared to conventional radial basis function used in ANN. The results are further improved by using probabilistic relaxation labeling as a postprocessing step. This paper has potential applications in urban planning and urban studies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6079321/06071003.pdf","startPage":"4815","endPage":"4820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object-Based Image Analysis of High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Modified Cloud Basis Function Neural Network and Probabilistic Relaxation Labeling Process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Image resolution","Object detection","Feature extraction","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","neural nets","object recognition","terrain mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object based image analysis","high resolution satellite images","modified cloud basis function neural network","probabilistic relaxation labeling process","remote sensing","object based image classification","land use","land cover","nonlinear separability","linear discriminant functions","artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accuracy assessment","artificial neural networks (ANNs)","high-resolution satellite imagery","object-based image analysis (OBIA)","probabilistic relaxation labeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Object-Based Image Analysis of High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Modified Cloud Basis Function Neural Network and Probabilistic Relaxation Labeling Process","volume":"49","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6071003/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376468","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object-Based Image Analysis of High-Resolution Satellite Images Using Modified Cloud Basis Function Neural Network and Probabilistic Relaxation Labeling Process","sourcePdf":"tgrs-rizvi-2171695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060844S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6079321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6079321","articleId":"6071003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6071006,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled A.

Based on the latest standard draft IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609.4, this paper proposes a variable CCH interval (VCI) multichannel medium access control (MAC) scheme, which can dynamically adjust the length ratio between CCH and SCHs. The scheme also introduces a multichannel coordination mechanism to provide contention-free access of SCHs. Markov modeling is conducted to optimize the intervals based on the traffic condition. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to help IEEE 1609.4 MAC significantly enhance the saturated throughput of SCHs and reduce the transmission delay of service packets while maintaining the prioritized transmission of critical safety information on CCH.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2171951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6205705/06071009.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2171951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6205705","startPage":"449","endPage":"458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IEEE 802.11p-Based Multichannel MAC Scheme With Channel Coordination for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An IEEE 802.11p-Based Multichannel MAC Scheme With Channel Coordination for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12761745","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6071009/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IEEE 802.11p-Based Multichannel MAC Scheme With Channel Coordination for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-leng-2171951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074713S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6205705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"6205705","articleId":"6071009","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6071013,"authors":[{"name":"Raja Giryes","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Raja","lastName":"Giryes","id":"37660798200"},{"name":"Michael Elad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Elad","id":"37283273600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6071013","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":999},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Matching pursuit algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Gaussian noise","Dictionaries","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","probability","signal denoising","signal reconstruction","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RIP-based near-oracle performance","denoising performance analysis","SP algorithm","CoSaMP algorithm","IHT algorithm","noisy signal recovery","additive random zero-mean white Gaussian noise","k-sparse representation","dictionary D","reconstruction error","probability","average error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Additive white noise","compressed sensing","Gaussian noise","signal denoising","signal reconstruction","signal representations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071013","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2174985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2174985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6146821","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6146821/06071013.pdf","startPage":"1465","endPage":"1468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RIP-Based Near-Oracle Performance Guarantees for SP, CoSaMP, and IHT","abstract":"This correspondence presents an average case denoising performance analysis for SP, CoSaMP, and IHT algorithms.

The proposed system will be termed a BA system. We assume that the statistics of the channel is known to the transmitter and a reverse link of very low rate is available so that the receiver can send back the quantized BA. Based on the statistics of the channel, we derive the statistical precoder so that bounds of the error rate averaged over the random correlated channel are minimized. Due to statistical precoding, the distribution of the BA is highly nonuniform. Treating BA as a vector signal, we quantize it using vector quantization (VQ), which is known to be particularly useful for quantizing signals with nonuniform distributions. As the distribution of BA is taken into consideration in the codebook design, a good tradeoff between performance and feedback rate can be achieved. Simulations show that the combination of statistical precoding and VQ-based quantization for BA leads to good performance with a small number of feedback bits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06071016.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2175011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2175011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Allocation and Statistical Precoding for Correlated MIMO Channels With Limited Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Receivers","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Vectors","Matrix decomposition","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","correlation methods","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters","statistical distributions","vector quantisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit allocation","statistical precoding","correlated MIMO channels","limited feedback","multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO transmitter","reverse link","MIMO receiver","random correlated channel","vector quantization","signal quantization","nonuniform distributions","codebook design","VQ-based quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit allocation","correlated channel","MIMO","precoding","VQ"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bit Allocation and Statistical Precoding for Correlated MIMO Channels With Limited Feedback","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6071016/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527169","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Allocation and Statistical Precoding for Correlated MIMO Channels With Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"tvt-lin-2175011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097651S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6071016","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6071019,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6139293/6071019/6071019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiran Chen (M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2005.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.

However, the large process variations of both magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and MOS transistors in the scaled technologies severely limit the yield of STT-RAM chips. In this work, we proposed a new sensing scheme, named as nondestructive self-reference sensing, or NSRS, for STT-RAM. By leveraging the different dependencies of the high and low resistance states of MTJs on the cell current amplitude, the proposed NSRS technique can work well at the scenario when bit-to-bit variation of MTJ resistances is large. Furthermore, we proposed three combined magnetic- and circuit-level techniques, including R-I curve skewing, yield-driven cell current selection, and ratio matching, to further improve the sense margin and robustness of NSRS sensing scheme. The measurement results of a 16 Kb STT-RAM test chip show that our proposed nondestructive self-reference sensing technique can reliably readout all the measured memory bits, of which 10% read failure rate was observed by using the conventional sensing technique. The three enhancement technologies ensure a 20 mV minimum sense margin and the whole sensing process can complete within 15 ns.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170778","startPage":"560","endPage":"573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6139293/06071019.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 130 nm 1.2 V/3.3 V 16 Kb Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory With Nondestructive Self-Reference Sensing Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A 130 nm 1.2 V/3.3 V 16 Kb Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory With Nondestructive Self-Reference Sensing Scheme","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487876","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6071019/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 130 nm 1.2 V/3.3 V 16 Kb Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory With Nondestructive Self-Reference Sensing Scheme","sourcePdf":"jssc-li-2170778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146566S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6139293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6139293","articleId":"6071019","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6071020,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Te Liao","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6109882/6071020/6071020-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Te Liao (S'03\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2003, the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2011.","In August 2011, he joined the Electrical Engineering Department, National Chung-Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, where he is currently an Assistant Professor.

The newly added features/modules include electromagnetic simulator to account for wall presence and target scattering, a wideband backprojection imaging algorithm, and different transceiver architectures and antenna array configurations. The developed platform is capable of time gating to suppress early wall reflections and simulates various discrete components and functions of the UWB SAR system using both linear and nonlinear analysis. The simulator has been experimentally validated for both dielectric and metallic targets. The developed simulator can also be used to study various effects related to operation frequency, pulse width, pulse shape, wall dispersion, and carrier leakage. It predicts UWB system performance such as detection range, image resolution, and receiver dynamic range. The system's components can be re-optimized for high performance 3-D imaging based on our developed models. The simulation platform is also suitable for designing the optimal signal waveform that could improve the recovered image quality for TWI applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2011","volume":"50","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"12691970","publicationDate":"May 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6071036/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Advanced System Level Simulation Platform for Three-Dimensional UWB Through-Wall Imaging SAR Using Time-Domain Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced System Level Simulation Platform for Three-Dimensional UWB Through-Wall Imaging SAR Using Time-Domain Approach","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2170694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143917S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6186874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6186874","articleId":"6071036","onlineDate":"07 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6071065,"authors":[{"name":"Selim Olcum","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6071037/6071065/6071065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Selim Ol\u00e7um was born in Chicago, IL, in 1981.

However, output power limitation of CMUTs compared with piezoelectrics has been a major drawback. In this work, we show that the output pressure of CMUTs can be significantly increased by deep-collapse operation, which utilizes an electrical pulse excitation much higher than the collapse voltage. We extend the analyses made for CMUTs working in the conventional (uncollapsed) region to the collapsed region and experimentally verify the findings. The static deflection profile of a collapsed membrane is calculated by an analytical approach within 0.6% error when compared with static, electromechanical finite element method (FEM) simulations. The electrical and mechanical restoring forces acting on a collapsed membrane are calculated. It is demonstrated that the stored mechanical energy and the electrical energy increase nonlinearly with increasing pulse amplitude if the membrane has a full-coverage top electrode. Utilizing higher restoring and electrical forces in the deep-collapsed region, we measure 3.5 MPa peak-to-peak pressure centered at 6.8 MHz with a 106% fractional bandwidth at the surface of the transducer with a collapse voltage of 35 V, when the pulse amplitude is 160 V. The experimental results are verified using transient FEM simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/6071037/06071065.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.2104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"2475","endPage":"2483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep-collapse operation of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Deep-collapse operation of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071065/","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6071065/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12357053","pubMedId":"22083780","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-collapse operation of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","sourcePdf":"t11b2475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16682S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6071037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6071037","articleId":"6071065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6071082,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6071079/6071082/6071082-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Wei Huang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science and information engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2010 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University.

These devices enable the electrical manipulation of microfluidics with various advantages, such as low power consumption, flexibility, accuracy, and efficiency. In addressing the need for low-cost and practical fabrication, pin-count reduction has become a key problem to the large-scale integration of EWOD-chip designs. One of the major approaches, broadcast addressing, reduces the pin count by assigning a single control pin to multiple electrodes with mutually compatible control signals. Most previous studies utilize this addressing scheme by scheduling fluidic-level synthesis on pin-constrained chip arrays. However, the associated interconnect routing problem is still not provided in currently available DMF automations, and thus the broadcast-addressing scheme cannot be actually realized. In this paper, we present the first network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm for EWOD-chip designs with a broadcast electrode-addressing scheme. Our algorithm simultaneously takes pin-count reduction and wirelength minimization into consideration for higher integration and better design performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm on a set of real-life chip applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6071079/06071082.pdf","startPage":"1786","endPage":"1799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2163158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2163158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network-Flow Based Pin-Count Aware Routing Algorithm for Broadcast-Addressing EWOD Chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Microfluidics","Electrodes","Actuators","Power demand","Printed circuits","Broadcast technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric devices","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","wetting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-flow based pin-count aware routing algorithm","broadcast-addressing EWOD chips","electrowetting-on-dielectric chips","digital microfluidic systems","pin-count reduction","fluidic-level synthesis","pin-constrained chip arrays","interconnect routing problem","wirelength minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast-addressing biochips","network flow","printed circuit board","routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Network-Flow Based Pin-Count Aware Routing Algorithm for Broadcast-Addressing EWOD Chips","volume":"30","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6071082/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360030","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network-Flow Based Pin-Count Aware Routing Algorithm for Broadcast-Addressing EWOD Chips","sourcePdf":"tcad-ho-2163158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100768S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6071079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6071079","articleId":"6071082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6071083,"authors":[{"name":"Roxana Ionutiu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Science, Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6071079/6071083/6071083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roxana Ionu\u0163iu (A'07) received the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from William Marsh Rice University, Houston, TX, in 2008.","This paper is part of her Ph.D. research on model reduction for multiterminal systems, conducted jointly at Jacobs University Bremen, Bremen, Germany, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, and NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven."]},"firstName":"Roxana","lastName":"Ionutiu","id":"38228154500"},{"name":"Joost Rommes","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6071079/6071083/6071083-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Joost Rommes received two M.S. degrees in computational science and computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands, in 2002, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Researcher with NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, and works on model reduction, specialized eigenvalue methods, and algorithms for problems related to circuit design and simulation."]},"firstName":"Joost","lastName":"Rommes","id":"37680983200"},{"name":"Wil H.

In this paper, we propose a novel stateful logic pipeline architecture based on memristive switches. The proposed architecture mapped to the field programmable nanowire interconnect fabric produces a field programmable stateful logic array, in which general-purpose computation functions can be implemented by configuring only nonvolatile nanowire crossbar switches. CMOS control switches are used to isolate stateful logic units so that multiple operations can be executed in parallel. Since basic operation of the stateful logic, namely, material implication, cannot fan out, a new basic AND operation which can duplicate output is proposed. The basic unit of the proposed architecture is designed to execute multiple basic operations concurrently in a step so that each basic unit implements a large fan-in OR or NOR gate. The fine-grain ultradeep constant-throughput pipeline properties pose new design automation problems. We address some of the issues, in particular logic representation using OR-inverter graphs, two-level optimization synthesis strategy, data synchronization with data forwarding, stall-free pipelined finite state machines, and constraints for synthesis and mapping onto the fabric.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","volume":"30","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6071085/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360033","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Field Programmable Stateful Logic Array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Programmable Stateful Logic Array","sourcePdf":"tcad-kim-2165067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094544S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6071079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6071079","articleId":"6071085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6071088,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammet Mustafa Ozdal","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6071079/6071088/6071088-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammet Mustafa Ozdal received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1999, and the M.S. degree in computer engineering in 2001, both from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2005.","He is currently a Research Scientist with the Strategic CAD Labs, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR.

However, vertical integration of layers exacerbates temperature-induced problems such as reliability degradation. Liquid cooling is a highly efficient solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems in 3-D architectures; however, it brings new challenges in modeling and run-time management for such 3-D MPSoCs with multitier liquid cooling. This paper proposes a novel design-time/run-time thermal management strategy. The design-time phase involves a rigorous thermal impact analysis of various thermal control variables. We then utilize this analysis to design a run-time fuzzy controller for improving energy efficiency in 3-D MPSoCs through liquid cooling management and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The fuzzy controller adjusts the liquid flow rate dynamically to match the cooling demand of the chip for preventing overcooling and for maintaining a stable thermal profile. The DVFS decisions increase chip-level energy savings and help balance the temperature across the system. Our controller is used in conjunction with temperature-aware load balancing and dynamic power management strategies. Experimental results on 2-tier and 4-tier 3-D MPSoCs show that our strategy prevents the system from exceeding the given threshold temperature. At the same time, we reduce cooling energy by up to 63% and system-level energy by up to 21% in comparison to statically setting a flow rate setting to handle worst-case temperatures.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2164540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6071079/06071089.pdf","endPage":"1896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multiobjective Thermal Control for Liquid-Cooled 3-D Stacked Architectures","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2164540","startPage":"1883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multiobjective Thermal Control for Liquid-Cooled 3-D Stacked Architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071089/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360036","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6071089/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Multiobjective Thermal Control for Liquid-Cooled 3-D Stacked Architectures","sourcePdf":"tcad-sabry-2164540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125155S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6071079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6071079","articleId":"6071089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6071091,"authors":[{"name":"Wangyang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Wangyang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37536602900"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872800"},{"name":"Frank Liu","affiliation":["IBM Research Laboratory, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275916700"},{"name":"Emrah Acar","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

By exploring the underlying sparse pattern in spatial frequency domain, VP achieves substantially lower sampling frequency than the well-known Nyquist rate. In addition, VP is formulated as a linear programming problem and, therefore, can be solved both robustly and efficiently. Our industrial measurement data demonstrate the superior accuracy of VP over several traditional methods, including 2-D interpolation, Kriging prediction, and k-LSE estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2164536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/6071079/06071091.pdf","startPage":"1814","endPage":"1827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2164536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Probe: A Statistical Framework for Low-Cost Silicon Characterization of Nanoscale Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Probe: A Statistical Framework for Low-Cost Silicon Characterization of Nanoscale Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360038","volume":"30","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Probe: A Statistical Framework for Low-Cost Silicon Characterization of Nanoscale Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcad-zhang-2164536-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081985S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6071079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"41","articleId":"6071091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6071215,"authors":[{"name":"Li Hongxing","affiliation":["Coll. of Automation, Beijing Union Univ., Beijing 100101, P.

It is suggested that a high-order system can be approximated by a low-order model with a time delay. The denominator parameters of the reduced-order model are determined by the Routh approximation method, then the numerator parameters and time delay are identified by the GA. The reduced-order models obtained by the proposed method will always be stable if the original system is stable and produce a good approximation to the original system in both the frequency domain and time domain.

While being cost-effective, such a solution can cause significant measurement errors due to phase noise and frequency offset in the local oscillators. In this paper, we systematically analyze the resulting errors and show that, in practice, overestimation of channel capacity by several hundred percent can occur. Overestimation is caused by phase noise (and to a lesser extent by frequency offset), leading to an increase of the MIMO channel rank. Our analysis furthermore reveals that the impact of phase errors is, in general, most pronounced if the physical channel has low rank (typical for line-of-sight or poor scattering scenarios). The extreme case of a rank-1 physical channel is analyzed in detail. The capacity bounds derived in this paper show excellent agreement with measurement results. In light of the findings of this paper, the results obtained through MIMO channel measurement campaigns using TDMS-based channel sounders should be interpreted with great care.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2165129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6071748/06071754.pdf","startPage":"7555","endPage":"7577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2165129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-Theoretic Analysis of MIMO Channel Sounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6071754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071754/","displayDocTitle":"Information-Theoretic Analysis of MIMO Channel Sounding","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-Theoretic Analysis of MIMO Channel Sounding","sourcePdf":"tit-bolcskei-2165129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08481S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6071748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6071754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6071756,"authors":[{"name":"Srikanth Jagabathula","affiliation":["Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Jagabathula","id":"37827925300"},{"name":"Devavrat Shah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Devavrat","lastName":"Shah","id":"37283901000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6071756","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":505},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Fourier transforms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","data compression","Fourier transforms","group theory","random functions","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained sensing","group theoretic Fourier transform","multiobject tracking","ranking systems","recommendation systems","discrete-time functions","nonnegative functions","natural random model","compressive sensing","convex relaxation","\u21131 optimization","information theoretic framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Fourier analysis over symmetric group","functions over permutations","sparsest-fit"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of recovering a function over the space of permutations (or, the symmetric group) over \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n elements from given partial information; the partial information we consider is related to the group theoretic Fourier Transform of the function. This problem naturally arises in several settings such as ranked elections, multi-object tracking, ranking systems, and recommendation systems.

In the absence of dispersion, this channel behaves as a collection of parallel per-sample channels. The conditional probability density function of the nonlinear per-sample channels is derived using both a sum-product and a Fokker-Planck differential equation approach. It is shown that, for a fixed noise power, the per-sample capacity grows unboundedly with input signal. The channel can be partitioned into amplitude and phase subchannels, and it is shown that the contribution to the total capacity of the phase channel declines for large input powers. It is found that a 2-D distribution with a half-Gaussian profile on the amplitude and uniform phase provides a lower bound for the zero-dispersion optical fiber channel, which is simple and asymptotically capacity-achieving at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A lower bound on the capacity is also derived in the medium-SNR region. The exact capacity subject to peak and average power constraints is numerically quantified using dense multiple ring modulation formats. The differential model underlying the zero-dispersion channel is reduced to an algebraic model, which is more tractable for digital communication studies, and, in particular, it provides a relation between the zero-dispersion optical channel and a 2 \u00d7 2 multiple-input multiple-output Rician fading channel. It appears that the structure of the capacity-achieving input distribution resembles that of the Rician fading channel, i.e., it is discrete in amplitude with a finite number of mass points, while continuous and uniform in phase.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2165793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6071748/06071761.pdf","startPage":"7522","endPage":"7541","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2165793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Per-Sample Capacity of Nondispersive Optical Fibers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Per-Sample Capacity of Nondispersive Optical Fibers","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6071761/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12356993","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071761/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Per-Sample Capacity of Nondispersive Optical Fibers","sourcePdf":"tit-yousefi-2165793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090468S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6071748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6071748","articleId":"6071761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6071814,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xianda Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Xianda","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6071814","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":968},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Artificial neural networks","MIMO","Equalizers","Estimation","Kalman filters","Vectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple input multiple output","channel equalization","channel estimation","artificial neural networks","symbol estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a channel estimation and equalization algorithm using three-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs) with feedback for multiple input multiple output wireless communication systems.

Most widely used are fingerprinting based techniques where a map of received signal strengths is used to infer the position based on comparing the current signal strength measurement to this map. Most research focuses on this inference itself and on the creation of accurate fingerprinting maps. In this paper we will not address those issues in depth but focus on analysing the fingerprint maps themselves in more detail. By looking closely into the maximum likelihood estimation for the position we will derive its expected uncertainty and show that it can be calculated for every possible position in advance from the fingerprint maps alone. This allows to derive an expected localisation accuracy map of the environment that can be used to assess and optimise the WiFi design based on localisation accuracy needs rather than relying on given access point placements solely based on coverage or signal-to-noise criteria.","doi":"10.1109/IPIN.2011.6071939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPIN.2011.6071939","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062621/6071904/06071939.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting the expected accuracy for fingerprinting based WiFi localisation systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6071939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predicting the expected accuracy for fingerprinting based WiFi localisation systems","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359094","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6071939/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting the expected accuracy for fingerprinting based WiFi localisation systems","confLoc":"Guimaraes, Portugal","sourcePdf":"204PredictingexpectedBeder2067905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064472S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062621","isNumber":"6071904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062621","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6071904","articleId":"6071939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6071957,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This has led to an under-utilization of licensed spectrum by licensed users, while other users are experiencing spectrum shortages. To correct this situation, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is emerging as a promising technology to enable unlicensed users to operate in unused licensed spectrum. To enable DSA, the unlicensed user must posses the capability of detecting the presence/absence of licensed users so that all users, licensed and unlicensed, can coexist without interference. In this paper, different sensing methods for detecting primary users' signals are reviewed before proposing automatic modulation classification detection's method for sensing the presence/absence of licensed users. The research presented in this paper focuses on the sensing of digitally modulated primary radio signals. In achieving this objective, a digital automatic modulation classifier was developed using an artificial neural network. The classifier results show accurate performance with an average success rate of above 99.50%. With the success recorded so far, the outcomes of this on-going research will produce a single sensing method capable of sensing all forms of primary radio signals in a cognitive radio environment. Compared with other detection methods, this sensing method promises better performance as all radio devices in the cognitive radio environment make use of one form of modulation technique or another when transmitting their signals.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062325/6071956/06072009.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural network for sensing primary radio signals in a cognitive radio environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural network for sensing primary radio signals in a cognitive radio environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072009/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358556","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural network for sensing primary radio signals in a cognitive radio environment","confLoc":"Victoria Falls, Zambia","sourcePdf":"NF001759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096067S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062325","isNumber":"6071956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062325","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6071956","articleId":"6072009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6072020,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The model assumes that PU channel occupancy can be described as a binary process. A two state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has thus been chosen and it is shown that the performance of the model is influenced by the algorithm employed for training the model. Traditional training algorithms are compared to certain evolutionary based training algorithms in terms of the resulting prediction accuracy and convergence time achieved. The performance of the model is important since it provides secondary users (SU) with a basis upon which channel switching and future channel allocation may be performed. Further simulation results illustrate the positive effect that our model has on channel switching under both heavy and light traffic density conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072020/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12358567","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072020/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a Hidden Markov channel occupancy model for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a Hidden Markov channel occupancy model for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Victoria Falls, Zambia","sourcePdf":"NF002003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087014S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062325","isNumber":"6071956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062325","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6071956","articleId":"6072020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6072038,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

In vehicular applications, cognitive radios typically transit regions with differing densities of primary users. Therefore, speed of detection is key, so detection based on a small number of samples is particularly advantageous for vehicular applications. Without assuming any prior knowledge of the primary user's signaling scheme, the channels between the primary user and the cognitive user, and the variance of the noise seen at the cognitive user, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed to detect the presence/absence of the primary user. Asymptotic performance analysis for the proposed GLRT is also presented. Performance comparison between the proposed GLRT and other existing methods such as the energy detector and several eigenvalue-based methods under the condition of unknown or inaccurately known noise variance is provided. Our results show that the proposed GLRT exhibits better performance than other existing techniques, especially when the number of samples is small, which is particularly critical in vehicular applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072049/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12358596","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072049/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rapid spectrum sensing with multiple antennas for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid spectrum sensing with multiple antennas for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Victoria Falls, Zambia","sourcePdf":"NF002763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103772S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062325","isNumber":"6071956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062325","xplore-issue":"6071956","articleId":"6072049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6072071,"authors":[{"name":"Philip R.

We introduce an adaptive scheme which incorporates the two algorithms into the design of the functional units of cognitive engine, to meet the requirements of transmit-power control.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071956","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062325/6071956/06072088.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive transmit-power control scheme for cognitive radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6072088/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive transmit-power control scheme for cognitive radios","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358635","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive transmit-power control scheme for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Livingstone","sourcePdf":"NF003859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049976S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062325","isNumber":"6071956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062325","xplore-issue":"6071956","articleId":"6072088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":6072097,"authors":[{"name":"Zdenek Kolka","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zdenek","lastName":"Kolka","id":"37546869900"},{"name":"Michal Kubicek","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Kubicek","id":"37887575400"},{"name":"Viera Biolkova","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Viera","lastName":"Biolkova","id":"37332024000"},{"name":"Irena Hlavickova","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Irena","lastName":"Hlavickova","id":"38016471400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-993-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-992-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-991-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6072097","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jitter","Clocks","Image edge detection","Markov processes","Bit error rate","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","clocks","error statistics","jitter","Markov processes","signal processing equipment","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDR analysis","sampling domain","statistical simulation model","feed-forward blind oversampling","clock circuit","data recovery circuit","hardware complexity","sampling phase","fixed-length window","Markov chain representation","bit-error rate","computational complexity","jitter period length","random jitter","sinusoidal jitter","frequency offset","transmit clocks","receive clocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind oversampling CDR","jitter tolerance","statistical methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072097","abstract":"The paper deals with a statistical simulation model for a newly proposed feed-forward blind oversampling Clock and Data Recovery circuit with low hardware complexity.

The proposed simulation model is based on periodic Markov chain representation of the domain-selection process. The averaged Bit-Error Rate can be simply computed from the steady-state of the chain. Computational complexity is determined by the jitter period length.

On the one hand, the power amplifiers cause up to 60 % of the power dissipation of a base station, on the other hand it constitutes a bottleneck concerning transmit bandwidth. The following paper presents a very promising concept of a highly efficient Doherty which supports multiband capability in order to enable future efficient, flexible and sustainable mobile radio applications.

Due to the mathematical difficulties of analyzing unevenly spaced event series or unevenly sampled signals, all of the previously described techniques are impeded by some severe limitations which result from either representing the signal based on an assumed and often insufficient physiological model of signal generation, or from simplifications in the selected signal processing tools. Though the described methods have their merits and allow sufficient description of heart rate in some special applications, there has been no systematic investigation into a continuous representation of unevenly sampled physiological signals which is free from any limitations or simplifying assumptions and which would allow an objective comparison of the known methods and the determination of the respective errors in order to decide which technique is the best suited for a specific application. In this paper a continuous representation of the point event series describing the temporal sequence of heart beats is presented which does not impose any limiting assumptions on the data analysis. The results obtained were validated through simulations in both time and frequency domains, and compared with the established techniques to allow the determination of errors at the specific times where the heart beats occur, as well as within the intervals between these sample points.","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072162","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062325/6071956/06072162.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous representation of unevenly sampled signals - An application to the analysis of heart rate variability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Continuous representation of unevenly sampled signals - An application to the analysis of heart rate variability","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072162/","accessionNumber":"12358709","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072162/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous representation of unevenly sampled signals - An application to the analysis of heart rate variability","confLoc":"Victoria Falls, Zambia","sourcePdf":"NF006157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045677S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062325","isNumber":"6071956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062325","xplore-issue":"6071956","articleId":"6072162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6072180,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoaki Nagaoka","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, Applied Electromagnetic Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoaki","lastName":"Nagaoka","id":"37410938000"},{"name":"Soichi Watanabe","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, Applied Electromagnetic Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Soichi","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37280301300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-993-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-992-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-991-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0033"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0025"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-0025"}],"articleNumber":"6072180","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Finite difference methods","Instruction sets","Time domain analysis","Kernel","Computational modeling","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","computer architecture","computerised instrumentation","dosimetry","electromagnetic fields","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-based 3D-FDTD computation","electromagnetic field dosimetry","numerical dosimetry","computational human model","computational memory","general purpose graphics processing unit","GPGPU","three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method","compute unified device architecture","CUDA","NVIDIA Tesla C2070","GPU-CPU speed ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic safety","GPGPU","FDTD method","Specific absorption rate","Human voxel model"]}],"abstract":"Numerical dosimetry with the computational human model using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has recently been used for a safety assessment of electromagnetic field applications. However, the FDTD calculation runs very slowly and requires a large amount of computational memory. We focus, therefore, on general purpose programming on the graphics processing unit (GPGPU). We implemented the three-dimensional (3D) FDTD method on GPUs using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). In this study, we used the NVIDIA Tesla C2070 as a GPGPU board and tested the performance of FDTD computation on GPUs. The results indicated that while the single GPU/CPU speed ratio varies depending on the calculation domain, 3D-FDTD computation using a GPU requires significantly less run time than that using a conventional CPU. We confirmed that the FDTD computation on a multi-GPU is much faster than that on a single GPU, and we also found that eight GPUs can compute faster than a vector supercomputer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-based 3D-FDTD computation for electromagnetic field dosimetry","publicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","doi":"10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Africon '11","pdfPath":"/iel5/6062325/6071956/06072180.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFRCON.2011.6072180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"GPU-based 3D-FDTD computation for electromagnetic field dosimetry","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072180/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358727","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-based 3D-FDTD computation for electromagnetic field dosimetry","confLoc":"Victoria Falls, Zambia","sourcePdf":"NF007072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084707S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6062325","isNumber":"6071956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6062325","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6071956","articleId":"6072180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6072183,"authors":[{"name":"Yakim Y.

Recent work has explored ways to embed high-dimensional features or complex distance functions into a low-dimensional Hamming space where items can be efficiently searched. However, existing methods do not apply for high-dimensional kernelized data when the underlying feature embedding for the kernel is unknown. We show how to generalize locality-sensitive hashing to accommodate arbitrary kernel functions, making it possible to preserve the algorithm's sublinear time similarity search guarantees for a wide class of useful similarity functions. Since a number of successful image-based kernels have unknown or incomputable embeddings, this is especially valuable for image retrieval tasks.

The term \u201cspacetime texture\u201d is taken to refer to patterns in visual spacetime, (x,y,t), that primarily are characterized by the aggregate dynamic properties of elements or local measurements accumulated over a region of spatiotemporal support, rather than in terms of the dynamics of individual constituents. Examples include image sequences of natural processes that exhibit stochastic dynamics (e.g., fire, water, and windblown vegetation) as well as images of simpler dynamics when analyzed in terms of aggregate region properties (e.g., uniform motion of elements in imagery, such as pedestrians and vehicular traffic). Spacetime texture representation and recognition is important as it provides an early means of capturing the structure of an ensuing image stream in a meaningful fashion. Toward such ends, a novel approach to spacetime texture representation and an associated recognition method are described based on distributions (histograms) of spacetime orientation structure. Empirical evaluation on both standard and original image data sets shows the promise of the approach, including significant improvement over alternative state-of-the-art approaches in recognizing the same pattern from different viewpoints.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6186729/06072218.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spacetime Texture Representation and Recognition Based on a Spatiotemporal Orientation Analysis","volume":"34","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072218/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12709867","pubMedId":"22064801","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072218/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spacetime Texture Representation and Recognition Based on a Spatiotemporal Orientation Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttp2012061193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045858S","chronDate":"June  2012","isNumber":"6186729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"66","articleId":"6072218","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6072221,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan J.

However, processing of highly squinted SAR data is usually a challenging task attributed to the spatial-variant range cell migration over a long aperture. The Omega-k algorithm is generally accepted as an ideal solution to this problem. In this paper, we focus on using the wavenumber-domain approach for highly squinted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) SAR imagery. A squinted phase gradient autofocus (SPGA) algorithm is proposed to overcome the severe motion errors, including phase and nonsystematic errors. Herein, the inconsistence of phase error and range error in the squinted wavenumber-domain imaging is first presented, which reveals that even the motion error introduces very small phase error, it causes considerable range error due to the Stolt mapping. Based on this, two schemes of SPGA-based motion compensation are developed according to the severity of motion error. By adapting the advantages of weighted phase gradient autofocus and quality phase gradient autofocus, the robustness of SPGA is ensured. Real measured data sets are used to validate the proposed approach for highly squinted UAV-SAR imagery.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2175216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178352","startPage":"1574","endPage":"1588","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6178352/06072230.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavenumber-Domain Autofocusing for Highly Squinted UAV SAR Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6072230/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wavenumber-Domain Autofocusing for Highly Squinted UAV SAR Imagery","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12669477","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavenumber-Domain Autofocusing for Highly Squinted UAV SAR Imagery","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhang-2175216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091509S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6178352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6178352","articleId":"6072230","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6072240,"authors":[{"name":"Hoc Phan","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hoc","lastName":"Phan","id":"37987468100"},{"name":"Trung Q.

The Bayesian focusing method minimizes the mean-square error of the transformation over the probability density functions (pdfs) of the DOAs, thus achieving improved focusing accuracy over the entire bandwidth. In order to solve the Bayesian focusing problem, we derive and utilize a weighted extension of the wavefield interpolated narrowband generated subspace (WINGS) focusing transformation. We provide a closed-form expression for the optimal BFT and extend it to the case of directional sensors. We then consider a numerical computation scheme of the BFT in the angular domain. We show that if an angular sampling condition is satisfied then the angle domain approximation yields the optimal BFT. We also treat the important issue of robust focused minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. We analyze the sensitivity of the focused MVDR to the focusing errors and show that the array gain (AG) is inversely proportional to the square of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for large values of the SNR, and highly sensitive to the focusing errors. In order to reduce this sensitivity we generalize the popular narrowband diagonal loaded MVDR to the focused wideband case, referred to as the Q-loaded focused MVDR wideband beamformer. We derive a closed-form analytic expression for the AG of the Q-loaded focused MVDR beamformer which depends on the focusing transformations. A numerical performance evaluation and simulations demonstrate the advantage of the BFT over that of other focusing transformations, for multiple source scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12536603","htmlLink":"/document/6072254/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Focusing for Coherent Wideband Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Focusing for Coherent Wideband Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tasl-cohen-2175384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10492S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6145765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6145765","articleId":"6072254","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6072256,"authors":[{"name":"Behtash Babadi","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Behtash","lastName":"Babadi","id":"37391447200"},{"name":"Scott M.

The main problem in stepped frequency SAR is the range difference in one sequence of pulses. This paper analyzes the influence of range difference in one sequence of pulses in detail and proposes a method to compensate this influence in the Doppler domain. A Stolt interpolation for the stepped frequency signal is used to focus the data accurately. The parameters for the stepped frequency SAR are analyzed, and some criteria are proposed for system design. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

However, it is often unavoidable in practice that the input blur kernel is erroneous to some extent. Sometimes, the error could be severe, e.g., for images degraded by nonuniform motion blurring. When an inaccurate blur kernel is used as the input, significant distortions will appear in the image recovered by existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel convex minimization model that explicitly takes account of error in the blur kernel. The resulting minimization problem can be efficiently solved by the so-called accelerated proximal gradient method. In addition, a new boundary extension scheme is incorporated in the proposed model to further improve the results. The experiments on both synthesized and real images showed the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm to both the image noise and the model error in the blur kernel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6072265/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12615446","pubMedId":"22084049","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Image Deblurring With an Inaccurate Blur Kernel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Image Deblurring With an Inaccurate Blur Kernel","sourcePdf":"tip-ji-2171699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085372S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6170603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6170603","articleId":"6072265","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6072266,"authors":[{"name":"Sathish Ramani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Com-puter Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sathish","lastName":"Ramani","id":"37286001600"},{"name":"Jeffrey A.

However, the huge dynamic range of the statistical weights leads to a highly shift-variant inverse problem making it difficult to precondition and accelerate existing iterative algorithms that attack the statistical model directly. We propose to alleviate the problem by using a variable-splitting scheme that separates the shift-variant and (\"nearly\") invariant components of the statistical data model and also decouples the regularization term. This leads to an equivalent constrained problem that we tackle using the classical method-of-multipliers framework with alternating minimization. The specific form of our splitting yields an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with an inner-step involving a \"nearly\" shift-invariant linear system that is suitable for FFT-based preconditioning using cone-type filters. The proposed method can efficiently handle a variety of convex regularization criteria including smooth edge-preserving regularizers and non- smooth sparsity-promoting ones based on the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm and total variation.

Fourier series of SELDP defined on a period is derived and the approximate series is extended to that defined on the set of whole positive real numbers. To show the feasibility of the obtained results, we first give an effective design scheme of electrical circuit related to SELDP signal and this may be helpful in future implementations. We concentrate on this case in which the unforced system possesses two homoclinic orbits. In order to apply Melnikov's approach to make the underlying parameter conditions for suppressing and inducing chaos more clear, a generic numerical algorithm is proposed to compute complicated Melnikov functions. Two propositions, serving as designing the correct parameters in the SELDP function are also given. From our study, we find that chaos can be induced (suppressed) according to the corresponding Melnikov functions have (do not have) simple zeros. Our work can help to understand the underlying mechanisms of suppressing and inducing chaos. The simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6174505/06072282.pdf","startPage":"784","endPage":"795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2169884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2169884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6174505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Approach to Chaos Suppressing and Inducing in a Periodically Forced Family of Nonlinear Oscillators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Orbits","Oscillators","Manifolds","Damping","Force","Discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","Fourier series","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos suppression","nonlinear oscillator","single-exponential local decay pulse","SELDP","damping","external periodic excitation","Fourier series","electrical circuit","homoclinic orbit","Melnikov function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos inducing","chaos suppressing","Melnikov's approach","nonlinear driven oscillators","periodic parameter perturbations","single-exponential local decay pulse (SELDP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to Chaos Suppressing and Inducing in a Periodically Forced Family of Nonlinear Oscillators","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6072282/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638992","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to Chaos Suppressing and Inducing in a Periodically Forced Family of Nonlinear Oscillators","sourcePdf":"tcsi-liao-2169884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104357S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6174505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6174505","articleId":"6072282","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6072283,"authors":[{"name":"Sujiang Rong","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6155677/6072283/6072283-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sujiang Rong received the B.Sc. degree in information science and electronic engineering from Zhe Jiang University, China, in 2003 and the M.Ph. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic and computer engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","From 2003 to 2006, he was with Winbond Electronic Ltd, Shanghai, China, developing 802.11a/b/g WLAN transceivers in standard CMOS.

It is shown that one-port oscillators consume less power than two-port counterparts but may suffer from stability problem which can be solved by a notch-peak cancellation technique. On the other hand, compared to one-port oscillators, two-port oscillators need to consume more power to obtain the same output swing, but their phase noise can be improved more linearly with increasing bias current, and thus they can achieve lower phase noise with a sufficiently large bias current. Based on the results, a dual-band quadrature voltage- controlled oscillator (Q-VCO) is systematically designed and implemented in a 0.13- m CMOS process for software-defined -radio (SDR) applications, in which the two-port topology is used in the low band for low phase noise and the one-port topology is employed in the high band for low power consumption.

It is shown that, due to the substantial differences between the SISO and MIMO systems, the extension is not straightforward and further significant development is necessary. A matrix relation property among the associated matrices under the augmenting and admissible elementary operations is first revealed. Based on this matrix relation property, the realization problem for the MIMO -D case is formulated as an elementary operation problem of a certain -D polynomial matrix, which makes the extension possible. General constructive procedures are then established for the regular realizations based on the right and left matrix fraction descriptions (MFDs) of a given transfer matrix, respectively, such that one can easily implement this approach by a computer program in, e.g., MATLAB or Maple. Numerical and symbolic examples are provided to illustrate the main ideas and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Elementary Operation Approach to Multidimensional Realization and LFR Uncertainty Modeling: The MIMO Case","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167262","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6155677/06072287.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","displayDocTitle":"A New Elementary Operation Approach to Multidimensional Realization and LFR Uncertainty Modeling: The MIMO Case","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6072287/","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556356","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Elementary Operation Approach to Multidimensional Realization and LFR Uncertainty Modeling: The MIMO Case","sourcePdf":"tcsi-xu-2167262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107302S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6155677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6155677","articleId":"6072287","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6072288,"authors":[{"name":"Ze-Kun Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6174505/6072288/6072288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ze-Kun Zhou was born on March 20, 1984.

However, practical approaches that can handle the complex decision-making process faced by decision makers to justify the long-term financial effects of distribution automation have remained scarce. An automated and remote-controlled sectionalizing switch play a fundamental role in an automated distribution network. This paper introduces a new optimization approach for distribution automation in terms of automated and remotely controlled sectionalizing switch placement. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is utilized to model the problem. The proposed model can be solved with large-scale commercial solvers in a computationally efficient manner. The proposed sectionalizing switch placement problem considers customer outage costs in conjunction with sectionalizing switch capital investment, installation, as well as annual operation and maintenance costs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on a reliability test system and a typical real size system. The presented results indicate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2171060","startPage":"362","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2011.2171060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6108459","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/6108459/06072299.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Sectionalizing Switch Placement Strategy in Distribution Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072299/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimized Sectionalizing Switch Placement Strategy in Distribution Systems","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6072299/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12425758","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Sectionalizing Switch Placement Strategy in Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-abirijahromi-2171060-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070352S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6108459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6108459","articleId":"6072299","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6072307,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Crocco","affiliation":["Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6072307/6072307-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Crocco received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering, computer science and telecommunications in 2009 from the University of Genova.","From 2005 to 2010, he was with the Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genova, in the Acoustic, Antennas Arrays, and Underwater Signals (A3US) Laboratory of the Signal Processing and Telecommunications Group.

Given the measures of a set of time of arrival delays at each sensor, the approach simultaneously estimates the 3D position of the sensors and the sources that have generated the event. Such inference is obtained with no assumption about the sensor localization; the only assumption made is that the emission time of the sources must be known in order to evaluate the time of flight for each event. Moreover, we propose a further method that deals with the likely case of missing data in the measurements. This occurs when sensors are far apart or behind natural barriers that avoids the registration of the given event.

Motivated by practical considerations, the capacity-achieving precoder is found by maximizing the capacity subject to two separate power constraints; namely, a constraint on the available power at the transmitter which is imposed on a per-amplifler basis, and a constraint on the allowable radiated power. These two separate constraints occur because MIMO antenna systems are usually unable to use a perfect conjugate multiport impedance match in practice and therefore MIMO systems with mutual coupling usually do not radiate all of the power input or available to them. Assuming that perfect channel state information is available to both the transmitter and receiver, we first derive sufficient conditions on the power constraints, in terms of the mutual coupling, under which the dual-constraint problem reduces to effectively a single-constraint problem. This greatly simplifies the optimization problem in some cases. For the more general case where both constraints are relevant, we present an efficient suboptimal algorithm by first relaxing the per-amplifier power constraint to a sum power constraint and then solving the dual-constraint problem based on dynamic water-filling and mode-dropping. Finally, we investigate the optimal precoder design at high signal to noise ratios, and provide stronger theoretical results in this regime. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique when dual power constraints are important to consider.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2175221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6126210/06072309.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2175221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126210","startPage":"848","endPage":"861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of MIMO Systems With Mutual Coupling: Transmitter Optimization With Dual Power Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of MIMO Systems With Mutual Coupling: Transmitter Optimization With Dual Power Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471567","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6072309/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of MIMO Systems With Mutual Coupling: Transmitter Optimization With Dual Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"tsp-mckay-2175221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097227S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6126210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6126210","articleId":"6072309","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6072310,"authors":[{"name":"Jinwen Hu","affiliation":["EXQUISITUS, Centre of E-City, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6126210/6072310/6072310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinwen Hu was born in Shanxi, China, in 1983.

The key factor defining the performance and complexity of such systems is the relaying protocol, i.e., the interface between the OFDM point-to-point backhaul link and the OFDMA point-to-multipoint service link. We introduce and analyze a comprehensive set of OFDM(A) relaying protocols that are based on the following design choices: whether to perform time-domain, frequency-domain, resource block (RB)-wise, or symbol-wise processing; whether to apply amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) retransmission; whether to implement random, fixed, or adaptive pairing of RBs in backhaul and service links; whether to introduce buffering over fading states or not; and how the time sharing between the backhaul and service links is controlled. The joint effect of all these design choices has not previously been evaluated in a unified framework or by means of closed-form performance expressions. The main contribution of this paper is to calculate the average ergodic system capacity when adopting each of the proposed relaying protocols. Consequently, the new expressions facilitate thorough numerical performance comparison between the different protocols in a typical suburban vehicular system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2175257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6129945/06072312.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2175257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of OFDM(A) Relaying Protocols: Capacity Analysis in Infrastructure Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072312/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of OFDM(A) Relaying Protocols: Capacity Analysis in Infrastructure Framework","volume":"61","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471790","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6072312/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of OFDM(A) Relaying Protocols: Capacity Analysis in Infrastructure Framework","sourcePdf":"tvt-riihonen-2175257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101797S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6129945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6129945","articleId":"6072312","onlineDate":"08 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6072327,"authors":[{"name":"Huo Yongqing","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Univ. of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 610054, P.

For the severely resource constrained applications, the energy-efficient and small size cryptography algorithm implementation is a critical problem. Hardware implementations of the advanced encryption standard (AES) for authentication and encryption are presented. An energy consumption variable is derived to evaluate low-power design strategies for battery-powered devices. It proves that compact AES architectures fail to optimize the AES hardware energy, whereas reducing invalid switching activities and implementing power-optimized sub-modules are the reasonable methods. Implementations of different substitution box (S-Boxes) structures are presented with 0.25 \u03bcm 1.8 V CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) standard cell library. The comparisons and trade-offs among area, security, and power are explored. The experimental results show that Galois field composite S-Boxes have smaller size and highest security but consume considerably more power, whereas decoder-switch-encoder S-Boxes have the best power characteristics with disadvantages in terms of size and security. The combination of these two type S-Boxes instead of homogeneous S-Boxes in AES circuit will lead to optimal schemes. The technique of latch-dividing data path is analyzed, and the quantitative simulation results demonstrate that this approach diminishes the glitches effectively at a very low hardware cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","volume":"19","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient and security-optimized AES hardware design for ubiquitous computing","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-efficient and security-optimized AES hardware design for ubiquitous computing","sourcePdf":"20080403652658.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03028S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"6072353","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6072360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6072382,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Yali","affiliation":["Coll. of Automation, Nanjing Univ. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, P.

First, based on the universality of single qubit rotation gate and two-qubit controlled-NOT gate, a quantum neuron model is constructed, which is composed of input, phase rotation, aggregation, reversal rotation and output. In this model, the input is described by qubits, and the output is given by the probability of the state in which |1\u3009 is observed. The phase rotation and the reversal rotation are performed by the universal quantum gates. Secondly, the quantum BP neural networks model is constructed, in which the output layer and the hide layer are quantum neurons. With the application of the gradient descent algorithm, a learning algorithm of the model is proposed, and the continuity of the model is proved. It is shown that this model and algorithm are superior to the conventional BP networks in three aspects: convergence speed, convergence rate and robustness, by two application examples of pattern recognition and function approximation.","doi":"10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60063-8","startPage":"167","endPage":"174","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971804/6072475/06072506.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1004-4132(08)60063-8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning algorithm and application of quantum BP neural networks based on universal quantum gates","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Quantum computing","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Computational modeling","Quantum mechanics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum computing","universal quantum gate","quantum neuron","quantum neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Learning algorithm and application of quantum BP neural networks based on universal quantum gates","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Learning algorithm and application of quantum BP neural networks based on universal quantum gates","sourcePdf":"200801167174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019543S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","isNumber":"6072475","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6072506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6072561,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Garber","bio":{"p":["Lee Garber, Computer, l.garber@computer.org"]},"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Garber","id":"37326562300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9162"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0814"}],"articleNumber":"6072561","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":653},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wreless communications","visible light communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communications","Subcarrier index-modulated orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","SIM-OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In the ongoing search for better ways to transmit data, researchers have turned to a wireless approach that has been discussed for years: visible light communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turning on the Lights for Wireless Communications","publicationTitle":"Computer","doi":"10.1109/MC.2011.352","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/6072553/06072561.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072553","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Turning on the Lights for Wireless Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6072561/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12357001","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turning on the Lights for Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"mco2011110011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087023S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"6072553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6072553","articleId":"6072561","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6072703,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These instruments use advanced proprietary solutions that are not applicable to low cost instrumentation easily. Accurate frame interleaved sampling becomes applicable when the waveform of interest can be excited at will, and requires these excitations to be delayed by a certain amount in relation to the ADC clock. An implementation of this mode using DCMs readily available in Xilinx FPGAs is described. The developed instrument cost about two orders of magnitude less than the real time DSO used for comparison, but nevertheless provided much better resolution of the acquired pulse responses at the tolerable expense of the increased measurement time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS.2011.6072703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072690","startPage":"20","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6063705/6072690/06072703.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of accurate frame interleaved sampling in a low cost FPGA-based data acquisition system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6072703/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of accurate frame interleaved sampling in a low cost FPGA-based data acquisition system","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359115","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of accurate frame interleaved sampling in a low cost FPGA-based data acquisition system","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"020025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099995S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6063705","isNumber":"6072690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6063705","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6072690","articleId":"6072703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6072743,"authors":[{"name":"Volodymyr Turchenko","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Computer Systems, Ternopil National Economic University, Ternopil, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Turchenko","id":"37444935100"},{"name":"Taras Puhol","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Computer Systems, Ternopil National Economic University, Ternopil, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Taras","lastName":"Puhol","id":"37681355900"},{"name":"Anatoly Sachenko","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Computer Systems, Ternopil National Economic University, Ternopil, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Anatoly","lastName":"Sachenko","id":"37273884500"},{"name":"Lucio Grandinetti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Informatics and Systems, University of Calabria, Rende, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Lucio","lastName":"Grandinetti","id":"37444060200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1425-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1426-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6072743","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Algorithm design and analysis","Prediction algorithms","Computational efficiency","Computational modeling","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","parallel processing","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluster-based implementation","resource brokering strategy","parallel training","neural network training","BSP computation model","Pareto optimality","weight coefficients approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computational cluster","resource broker","Pareto-optimality","neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072743","abstract":"The implementation issues of a cluster-based resource brokering strategy intended for efficient parallelization of neural networks training are presented in this paper.

An iterative method based on a finite difference approach has been used for the numerical solution (red black point successive over relaxation). The main idea is to move the computationally intensive parts of the algorithm onto the GPU. Because of the lack of communication between the blocks of the GPU grid, the computations have been included in two separate kernels. An important improvement to the GPU implementation has been the padding of the memory buffers which has led to fewer global memory transactions and faster kernel execution times. The performances of the two versions of the algorithm (CPU and CPU-GPU) have been compared on three different grained grids. The results indicate a speed-up which varies from around two for the coarsest grid up to over one order of magnitude for the finest grid.","doi":"10.1109/IDAACS.2011.6072748","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6063705/6072690/06072748.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS.2011.6072748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072690","startPage":"238","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated simulation of elliptic partial differential equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6072748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated simulation of elliptic partial differential equations","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072748/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359158","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6072748/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated simulation of elliptic partial differential equations","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"238242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048473S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6063705","isNumber":"6072690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6063705","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6072690","articleId":"6072748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6072759,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this condition the on-line testing methods expose a new property to reject the reliable results detecting the inessential errors. This fact makes a problem of low reliability of on-line testing methods in checking the result. The ways to increase a reliability of the on-line testing methods in checking the result using the features of approximate calculations are shown.

the issue and receipt of tender documentation through electronic means which facilitates the procurement of construction work and the award of contracts. The current paperbased method of tendering has been commonplace within the industry for a significant number of years, but with recent technological advancements, this traditional process is rapidly becoming outdated. Several major projects within the UK are now being procured through the e-tendering process which includes the multibillion pound development for the Olympic Games in London 2012. However, while these prestigious projects are embracing e-tendering technology, it is not certain as to what extent e-tendering is used across the construction sector generally. This research is primarily concerned with establishing the current status, practicalities and resource effectiveness of e-tendering within UK construction. Results are provided from an industry survey which includes both quantitative and qualitative data. A case study implementation is also included which assesses the utilisation of e-tendering software in practice. The research findings indicated that e-tendering can provide substantial resource savings to a major part of the supply chain, with the key benefits being enhanced communication, time savings and reduced costs. However, a considerable proportion of the industry remains uncertain about embracing new technologies, with reluctance to change being perceived as the greatest barrier. The findings suggest that many professionals within the UK construction industry recognise a requirement for increased implementation of e-tendering, but feel that training, education and support from senior management are essential requirements for e-tendering to become widely accepted in the future.","doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(08)70161-5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(08)70161-5","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6072946/06072992.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"E-tendering tendering process within construction: A UK perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6072992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"E-tendering tendering process within construction: A UK perspective","volume":"13","issue":"S1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"E-tendering tendering process within construction: A UK perspective","sourcePdf":"273278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050297S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"6072946","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","articleId":"6072992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6073012,"authors":[{"name":"Hitoshi Furuta","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Kansai University, Takatsuki, Osaka 569-1095, Japan"],"firstName":"Hitoshi","lastName":"Furuta"},{"name":"Ken Ishibashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kansai University, Takatsuki, Osaka 569-1095, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Ishibashi"},{"name":"Koichiro Naka Tsu","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Kansai University, Takatsuki, Osaka 569-1095, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichiro Naka","lastName":"Tsu"},{"name":"Shun Hotta","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kansai University, Takatsuki, Osaka 569-1095, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Hotta"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6073012","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Delay","Uncertainty","Robustness","Roads","Earthquakes","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["restoration schedule","genetic algorithm","uncertainty","delay of schedule"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073012","abstract":"The purpose of this research is to propose an early restoration for lifeline systems after earthquake disasters. The previous researches show that the optimization of the restoration schedule by using genetic algorithm (GA) is powerful. However, those are not considering the uncertain environment after earthquake disasters. The circumstances of the damage at devastated areas are very changeable due to the aftershock, fire disaster and bad weather. In addition, the restoring works may delay by unexpected accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the restoration schedule which has robustness, because the actual restoring works could not progress smoothly under the uncertain environment. GA considering uncertainty (GACU) can treat various uncertainties involved, but it is difficult to obtain the robust schedule. In this study, an attempt is made to develop a decision support system of the optimal restoration scheduling by using the improved GACU.","doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(08)70181-0","startPage":"400","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(08)70181-0","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072946","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6072946/06073012.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal restoration scheduling of damaged networks under uncertain environment by using improved genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073012/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal restoration scheduling of damaged networks under uncertain environment by using improved genetic algorithm","volume":"13","issue":"S1","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimal restoration scheduling of damaged networks under uncertain environment by using improved genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"400405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01928S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"6072946","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6073012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6073023,"authors":[{"name":"Jiansong Gan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Jiansong","lastName":"Gan"},{"name":"Yunzhou Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Yunzhou","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Shidong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Shidong","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6073023","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Random variables","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Receivers","Power demand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed antenna system (DAS)","minimum mean-square error (MMSE)","sum rate","power consumption","random matrix theory"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum rate and power consumption of a circular-layout distributed antenna system with MMSE receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073023","doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(08)72197-7","startPage":"759","endPage":"768","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6073017/06073023.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(08)72197-7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073017","abstract":"The distributed antenna system (DAS) is considered as a promising architecture for future wireless access. This paper describes the uplink of a power-controlled circular-layout DAS (CL-DAS) with minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers. Results from random matrix theory are used to show that for such a DAS, the per-user sum rate and the total transmit power both converge as the number of users and antennas goes to infinity with a constant ratio of antennas to users. The relationship between the asymptotic per-user sum rate and the asymptotic total transmit power is given for all possible values of the radius of the circle on which antennas are placed. This rate-power relationship is then used to find the optimal radius. With this optimal radius, the CL-DAS is proved to offer a significant gain compared with a traditional co-located antenna system. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the analysis and the superiority of the DAS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073023/","volume":"13","issue":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Sum rate and power consumption of a circular-layout distributed antenna system with MMSE receivers","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sum rate and power consumption of a circular-layout distributed antenna system with MMSE receivers","sourcePdf":"759768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045197S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","isNumber":"6073017","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6073023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6073029,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Intelligent Transportation Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Huadong Meng","affiliation":["Intelligent Transportation Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Huadong","lastName":"Meng"},{"name":"Wang Xiqin","affiliation":["Intelligent Transportation Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xiqin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6073029","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073029","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Correlation","Bandwidth","Radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["coherent train","autocorrelation function (ACF)","sidelobes suppression","genetic algorithm (GA)","performance improvement"]}],"doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(08)72203-X","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6073017/06073029.pdf","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","startPage":"800","endPage":"806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(08)72203-X","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppressing autocorrelation sidelobes of LFM pulse trains with genetic algorithm","abstract":"Modulations and diversities, including the Costas-ordered stepped-frequency and nonlinear stepped-frequency waveforms are widely used in linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse trains to reduce the relatively high autocorrelation function (ACF) sidelobes.

It is found that the correlation output deteriorates greatly when the FM interference power exceeds the anti-jamming limit of the radar. According to the fact that the PRC-CW radar echo is a wideband pseudo random signal occupying the whole TF plane, while the FM interference only concentrates in a small portion, a new method is proposed based on adaptive short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and time-varying filtering for FM interference suppression. This method filters the received signal by using a binary mask to excise only the portion of the TF plane corrupted by the interference. Two types of interference, linear FM (LFM) and sinusoidal FM (SFM), under different signal-to-jamming ratio (SJR) are studied. It is shown that the proposed method can effectively suppress the FM interference and improve the performance of target detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073083/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","publicationDate":"April 2010","displayDocTitle":"FM interference suppression for PRC-CW radar based on adaptive STFT and time-varying filtering","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"FM interference suppression for PRC-CW radar based on adaptive STFT and time-varying filtering","sourcePdf":"2010No2P219223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017551S","chronDate":"April  2010","isNumber":"6073071","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6073083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6073124,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Ishtiaq Ahmad","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, P.

A new numerical order selection scheme is presented based on fractional power spectra (FrFT moment) of the linear chirp signal. This method can adaptively determine the optimum FrFT order by maximizing the second-order central FrFT moment. This makes the desired chirp signal substantially concentrated whereas the noise is rejected considerably. This improves the mean square error minimization beamformer by reducing effectively the signal-noise cross terms due to the finite data length de-correlation operation. Simulation results show that the new method works well under a wide range of signal to noise ratio and signal to interference ratio.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971804/6073117/06073124.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"369","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2010.03.003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2010.03.003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order selection in fractional Fourier transform based beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimized production technology","Array signal processing","Chirp","Signal to noise ratio","Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)","fractional moments","chirp signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Order selection in fractional Fourier transform based beamforming","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Order selection in fractional Fourier transform based beamforming","sourcePdf":"2010No3P361369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040453S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"6073117","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6073124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6073145,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an 710072, P.

However, most CFB boilers in China usually burn hard coals such as anthracite and bituml nous coal and coal wastes, so the carbon content in the fly ash from these boilers is higher than expected. This paper investigates the source of unburned carbon in the fly ash of CFB boilers burning hard coal through a series of field tests and laboratory investigations. The char behavior during combustion, including fragmentation and de activation, which is related to the parent coal, has an important impact on the carbon burnout in CFB boilers. The research shows that char deactivation occurs during char burnout in fluidized bed combustion, especially for large particles of low rank coal. The uneven mixing of solids and air in the core region of the furnace also causes poor burnout of carbon in CFB fly ash. An index describing the volatile content (as dry ash free basis) over the heating value is proposed to present the coal rank. The coal combustion efficiency is shown to be strongly connected with this coal index. Several changes in the CFB boiler design are suggested to reduce the unburned carbon loss in the fly ash.","startPage":"687","endPage":"691","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6073218/06073228.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unburned carbon loss in fly ash of CFB boilers burning hard coal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2003","displayDocTitle":"Unburned carbon loss in fly ash of CFB boilers burning hard coal","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Unburned carbon loss in fly ash of CFB boilers burning hard coal","sourcePdf":"687691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049835S","chronDate":"Dec.  2003","isNumber":"6073218","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6073228","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6073317,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The performance of these equipments were analyzed using the IEEE Benchmark model concluding that the proposed CBCR has better performance than the TCSC for damping both electromechanical power oscillation and the subsynchronous resonance (SSR).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Power capacitors","Oscillators","Power transmission lines","Torque","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","power capacitors","power convertors","power system stability","subsynchronous resonance","synchronous generators","thyristor applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous generator power oscillation damper","TCSC","SSSC","variable reactance","thyristor controlled series capacitor","static synchronous series compensator","generator-long transmission line system","CBCR","converter based controlled reactance","POD","IEEE benchmark model","subsynchronous resonance","SSR","electromechanical power oscillation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power oscillations","subsynchronous resonance","TCSC","SSSC","CBCR","voltage source converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073368","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059525/6073288/06073368.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronous generator power oscillations damped by using TCSC or SSSC working as a variable reactance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronous generator power oscillations damped by using TCSC or SSSC working as a variable reactance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073368/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6073368/","accessionNumber":"12389753","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronous generator power oscillations damped by using TCSC or SSSC working as a variable reactance","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"056PE11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05595S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059525","isNumber":"6073288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059525","xplore-issue":"6073288","articleId":"6073368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6073369,"authors":[{"name":"Ghazanfar Shahgholian","affiliation":["Naiafabad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Esfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Ghazanfar","lastName":"Shahgholian","id":"37570096000"},{"name":"Seyed Mohsen Mirbagheri","affiliation":["Naiafabad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Esfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohsen","lastName":"Mirbagheri","id":"38228378400"},{"name":"Hosein Safaeipoor","affiliation":["Naiafabad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Esfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hosein","lastName":"Safaeipoor","id":"38228378100"},{"name":"Mehdi Mahdavian","affiliation":["Naein Branch, Islamic Azad University, Esfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Mahdavian","id":"37570094900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1043-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1044-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1042-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6073369","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073369","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Power system stability","Damping","Mathematical model","Power system dynamics","Loading","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","flexible AC transmission systems","power system control","power system dynamic stability","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static var compensator","SVC-FACTS controller","power system oscillation damping control","dynamic stability","supplementary control","SMIB power system","pole-placement technique","IEEE type-ST1"]}],"abstract":"Static var compensator (SVC) is used to improve the dynamic stability of the system using supplementary control.

The dual linear motors servo system comprises two parallel permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs). The dynamics of the single-axis motion system with a lumped uncertainty which contains parameter variations, external disturbances and nonlinear friction force is briefly introduced first. Then, a CSMC is designed to guarantee the precision position tracking requirement in single-axis control for the dual linear motors. Moreover, to enhance the robustness to uncertainties and to eliminate the synchronous error of dual linear motors, the CSMC with a SFNN compensator is proposed where the SFNN compensator is designed mainly to compensate the synchronous error.

Computer simulation using finite element technique has been conducted to study the torque waveform.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073528","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059525/6073288/06073528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073288","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"No-load torque ripple analysis of a novel permanent magnet synchronous motor with anti-rotation dual rotors using finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"No-load torque ripple analysis of a novel permanent magnet synchronous motor with anti-rotation dual rotors using finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073528/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12389912","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6073528/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No-load torque ripple analysis of a novel permanent magnet synchronous motor with anti-rotation dual rotors using finite element method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"216PSCM09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064752S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059525","isNumber":"6073288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059525","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6073288","articleId":"6073528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6073553,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-Dong Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu-Dong","lastName":"Kim","id":"38240335300"},{"name":"Jun-Gu Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Gu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37407283600"},{"name":"Yong-Chae Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Namseoul University, Cheonan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Chae","lastName":"Jung","id":"37400442500"},{"name":"Chung-Yuen Won","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chung-Yuen","lastName":"Won","id":"37270902400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1043-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1044-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1042-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6073553","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":809},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved non-isolated high voltage gain boost converter using coupled inductors","abstract":"In some cases of grid connected system using photovoltaic modules, high voltage gain is required to match the grid voltage.

The problems such as damper winding vibration and fracture caused by electromagnetic force often occur. Due to the relative movement between magnetic field produced by harmonic and negative sequence currents and damper windings, the electromagnetic force acting on damper windings is more obvious, therefore, it is very necessary to quantitatively calculate the electromagnetic force on damper windings with harmonic and native sequence currents considered. In this paper, the 1000 MW hydro-generator was taken as an example, and the 2D electromagnetic field-circuit-motion coupled time-stepping element method mathematical model of the hydro-generator was established, using the independent coordinate system subdivision method, which can fully consider the slot effect, saturation effect, etc. The calculation results indicate that the value and distribution of electromagnetic force on damper windings are much different between rated load operating and negative sequence operating condition, the connection feature of the damper windings and magnetic slot wedge both have influence on electromagnetic force on damper windings. So these factors had been taken into account in this hydro-generator model. The conclusions in this paper can provide theory reference for large capacity hydro-generator design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Electromagnetic forces","Bars","Shock absorbers","Windings","Magnetomechanical effects","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","finite element analysis","hydroelectric generators","machine theory","machine windings","shock absorbers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic force","damper winding vibration","hydrogenerator model","damper system","magnetic field","negative sequence currents","2D electromagnetic field-circuit-motion coupled time-stepping element method","mathematical model","independent coordinate system subdivision method","saturation effect","slot effect","magnetic slot wedge","finite element model","power 1000 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hydro-generator","electromagnetic force","damper winding","finite element method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073681","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059525/6073288/06073681.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and calculation of electromagnetic force on damper windings for 1000MW hydro-generator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and calculation of electromagnetic force on damper windings for 1000MW hydro-generator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073681/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6073681/","accessionNumber":"12389368","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and calculation of electromagnetic force on damper windings for 1000MW hydro-generator","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"369PSTHG02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047389S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059525","isNumber":"6073288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059525","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6073288","articleId":"6073681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6073769,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336627100"},{"name":"Hun Young Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hun Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"38240472100"},{"name":"Myung Jin Jun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung Jin","lastName":"Jun","id":"38231944900"},{"name":"Seung Chul Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Chul","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600723600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1043-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1044-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1042-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6073769","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"abstract":"This paper deals with finding the optimal ratio of height and length of Single-Sided Linear Induction Motors (SLIM) using Finite Element Method (FEM) for magnetic field analysis coupled with optimal design methodology. For effective analysis, FEM is conducted in time harmonic field which provides steady state performance with the fundamental components of voltage and current. The ratio of height to length providing the required output power is obtained by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and optimal values are presented by the variation in output power. When output power is small, the ratio is high and as the power increases, the ratio shows a converged value. Considering the general application of linear motors, using a small ratio can be limiting, however, the shape ratio for maximum thrust can be identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059525/6073288/06073769.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073288","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum shape design of single-sided linear induction motors using response surface methodology and finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Shape","Induction motors","Response surface methodology","Finite element methods","Magnetic circuits","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","linear induction motors","machine theory","magnetic fields","response surface methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-sided linear induction motors","optimum shape design","finite element method","optimal ratio","magnetic field analysis","optimal design","time harmonic field","steady state performance","response surface methodology","maximum thrust"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimum shape design of single-sided linear induction motors using response surface methodology and finite element method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6073769/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12389455","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum shape design of single-sided linear induction motors using response surface methodology and finite element method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"457PSCM35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049296S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059525","isNumber":"6073288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059525","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6073288","articleId":"6073769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6073795,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipments, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37595292500"},{"name":"Yongdong Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipments, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279894000"},{"name":"Zedong Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power System and Generation Equipments, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zedong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538780100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1043-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1044-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1042-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6073795","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073795","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Electric potential","Switches","Voltage control","Inverters","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate bipolar transistors","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neutral-point potential balancing algorithm","five-level active neutral-point-clamped converters","flying-capacitor converters","zero-sequence voltage injection","insulated gate bipolar transistors","IGBT"]}],"abstract":"Five-level active neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter is a newly emerging topology which can overcome the drawbacks of traditional neutral-point clamped (NPC) converters and flying-capacitor (FC) converters. Its dc-link is subdivided into two equal parts and the main problem is the neutral-point (NP) potential balancing. In this paper, a NP potential balancing algorithm based on zero-sequence voltage injection is presented. By calculating the NP currents of all key zero-sequence voltages, the most appropriate zero-sequence voltage is selected to generate the demanded NP current. Moreover, by further limiting the span of injected zero-sequence voltages, the NP balancing algorithm can make the two IGBTs connected in series operate at fundamental frequency. A three-phase five-level ANPC inverter prototype was built up and experimental results are presented to verify the validity of this algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073795","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6059525/6073288/06073795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2011.6073795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neutral-point potential balancing algorithm for five-level ANPC converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A neutral-point potential balancing algorithm for five-level ANPC converters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6073795/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12389481","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6073795/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neutral-point potential balancing algorithm for five-level ANPC converters","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"483PSPE66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060989S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6059525","isNumber":"6073288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6059525","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6073288","articleId":"6073795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6073803,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Lie","firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Lie","id":"37543247700"},{"name":"Li Yongdong","firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yongdong","id":"37271204300"},{"name":"Ma Hongwei","firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Hongwei","id":"38467412500"},{"name":"Zheng Zedong","firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zedong","id":"37590087600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1043-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1044-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1042-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6073803","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6073803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Support vector machines","Modulation","Matrix converters","Capacitors","Aerospace electronics","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","matrix convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude coefficient","multilevel matrix converter space vector modulation","AC AC converters","regeneration capability","energy store elements","high power application","matrix converter topology","SABER simulation"]}],"abstract":"The AC-AC converters (such as matrix converter) gains increasingly attention in recent years due to their merit in compact design, regeneration capability and no large energy store elements.

Good dynamic and static performance of servo system requires controlling inertia robustly. In this paper, in order to get the moment of rotational inertia, online identification methods based on model reference adaptive identification (MRAI) were developed.

The WNN controller parameters are updated continuously on-line for drive operating conditions using the back propagation training algorithm. The Lyapunov-based stability criterion is used for robust operation of the WNN speed controller. In order to operate the IPM motor above the rated speed, the flux-weakening control technique is used. The maximum torque per ampere control technique is used below the rated speed. The proposed WNN speed controller is implemented for the IPM motor drive system in simulation and experiment. The WNN controller-based drive system is implemented in real-time using a DSP controller board. The performances of the WNN controller are compared to those of conventional fixed-gain and adaptive speed controllers.

A Streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilized finite element method is proposed to solve the air governing formulations in the region between the cables and the retaining tunnel in the underground power transmission system. In thermal analysis, a nonlinear-coupled electromagnetic-thermal model of underground cables and the radiation heat exchanges between external cables surface and internal tunnel surface is proposed. The analysis reveals that the convection induced heat exchange is much stronger than the conduction induced heat exchange in the air between external cables surface and internal tunnel surface. At last, Newton-Rahpson iteration method is used to evaluate the cable ampacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/6064644/6074261/06074407.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2011.6074407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2011.6074407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6074261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6074407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal analysis of cables in tunnel using SUPG finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil","Thermal conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convection","finite element analysis","Galerkin method","heat conduction","heat radiation","Newton-Raphson method","power cables","thermal analysis","tunnels","underground cables","underground transmission systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cable thermal analysis","SUPG finite element method","ampacity evaluation","underground power cables","streamline-upwind-Petrov-Galerkin stabilized FEM","underground power transmission system","nonlinear-coupled electromagnetic thermal model","radiation heat","cable surface","tunnel surface","convection-induced heat exchange","conduction-induced heat exchange","Newton-Rahpson iteration method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal Field","Finite Element Method","Cable Ampacity","Tunnel","Coupled Analysis","SUPG Stabilized Formulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Thermal analysis of cables in tunnel using SUPG finite element method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6074407/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12386405","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","conferenceDate":"9-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal analysis of cables in tunnel using SUPG finite element method","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2011PSEC238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082559S","chronDate":"9-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6064644","isNumber":"6074261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6064644","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6074261","articleId":"6074407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6074408,"authors":[{"name":"\u0130lker Y\u0131lmaz","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey","T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-UZAY, Power Electronics Group, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u0130lker","lastName":"Y\u0131lmaz","id":"38014745300"},{"name":"Muammer Ermi\u015f","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Muammer","lastName":"Ermi\u015f","id":"38229089900"},{"name":"I\u015f\u0131k \u00c7ad\u0131rc\u0131","affiliation":["T\u00dcB\u0130TAK-UZAY, Power Electronics Group, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"I\u015f\u0131k","lastName":"\u00c7ad\u0131rc\u0131","id":"38192817600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9500-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9498-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9499-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"},{"format":"CD","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"6074408","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":434},"abstract":"The variable frequency operation of the coreless induction melting furnace has been investigated in detail both theoretically and experimentally.

The linear frequency modulation signals superimposed on the data signals are used as the training signals. By performing FRFT on the received signals and searching the peak value of the FRFT results, the receiver can realize timing synchronization and frequency offset acquisition simultaneously. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm can provide better timing synchronization performance and larger frequency offset acquisition range even under multi-path channels with low signal to noise ratio.

These clocks have gravitational and motional frequency shifts which are so large that, without properly accounting for relativistic effects, the system would not work. As a practical matter, therefore, many individuals who use the GPS need to understand how relativistic effects are accounted for in the system. This paper discusses relativistic effects arising from both special relativity and general relativity, and how these effects are incorporated in GPS operations. Two introductory sections on kinematics in special and general relativity, respectively, are followed by a section which describes how relativistic effects should be accounted for. The concept of synchronization in the Earth-Centered Inertial frame is discussed in detail. Numerical and experimental examples are given, showing the sizes of the various effects. The treatment of special and general relativity is sufficiently complete that a person should be able to follow the development without much reference to external material, except that a few standard results have been quoted from textbooks without derivation.","startPage":"199","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971804/6074789/06074806.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6074789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relativistic effects in the global positioning system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Relativistic effects in the global positioning system","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Relativistic effects in the global positioning system","sourcePdf":"199237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025773S","chronDate":"Dec.  1995","isNumber":"6074789","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6074806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6074817,"authors":[{"name":"Min Yao","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, Hangzhou University, Hangzhou 310028, P.

To capture the tradeoff between obtaining good performance and saving as much energy as possible for both classes of terminals, we propose a noncooperative game with strict incomplete information (i.e., a pre-Bayesian game) based on an energy-efficient criterion that depends on each terminal's status. This formulation allows us to derive an iterative and distributed algorithm that enables each terminal to locally regulate its optimal transmit power without any knowledge about all others' operating status. A numerical example is reported to measure the improvements provided by the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2175361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6167334/06074921.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2175361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6167334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pre-Bayesian Game for CDMA Power Control During Network Association","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6074921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074921/","displayDocTitle":"A Pre-Bayesian Game for CDMA Power Control During Network Association","volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578201","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6074921/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pre-Bayesian Game for CDMA Power Control During Network Association","sourcePdf":"jstsp-bacci-2175361-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129008S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6167334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6167334","articleId":"6074921","onlineDate":"09 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6074929,"authors":[{"name":"Haiquan Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290335100"},{"name":"Xiangping Zeng","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiangping","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288001900"},{"name":"Xiaoqiang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240063700"},{"name":"Zhengyou He","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyou","lastName":"He","id":"37291353700"},{"name":"Tianrui Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Technology, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tianrui","lastName":"Li","id":"37280718200"},{"name":"Weidong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37087065016"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"6074929","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":891},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6074929","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter banks","Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood detection","Filtering theory","Finite impulse response filter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic filters","active noise control","adaptive filters","nonlinear acoustics","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive extended pipelined second-order Volterra filter","nonlinear active noise controller","nonlinear filtered-x algorithms","filter bank implementation","standard SOV filter","filtered-x least mean square","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active noise control (ANC)","adaptive Volterra filter","filtered-x LMS algorithm","pipelined architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2175383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6145765/06074929.pdf","startPage":"1394","endPage":"1399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2175383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Extended Pipelined Second-Order Volterra Filter for Nonlinear Active Noise Controller","abstract":"This correspondence presents an extended pipelined second-order Volterra (EPSOV) filter for active control of nonlinear noise processes.

However, the resulting increase in copper losses leads to higher temperatures in the coils, particularly in the center of the slots where the thermal resistance to the ambient/cooling surfaces is highest. In this paper, a novel, simple technique is presented in which a higher thermal conductivity path between the center of the slot and the cooling arrangement is created, thus increasing the heat flow away from the slot center. A lumped-parameter thermal model is presented and used along with finite-element analysis to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The lumped-parameter model is also used for optimizing the high conductivity path for maximum air-gap shear stress and to obtain a compromise between the reduced slot area and the improved temperature distribution. Experimental validation is then presented to compare the predicted results with the measured results on a purposely built instrumented setup.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Thermal Improvement Technique for the Phase Windings of Electrical Machines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2011.2175470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6132606/06074939.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2011.2175470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6074939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Thermal Improvement Technique for the Phase Windings of Electrical Machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6074939/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477599","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Thermal Improvement Technique for the Phase Windings of Electrical Machines","sourcePdf":"tia-galea-2175470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074301S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6132606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6132606","articleId":"6074939","onlineDate":"09 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6074940,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Ming Lai","affiliation":["Power SBG Power SBG, Lite-ON Technology Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6132606/6074940/6074940-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ching-Ming Lai (S'06\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in aeronautical engineering in the honor of the top-rated prize from National Huwei University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan, in 2004, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu Taiwan, in 2010.","He is currently with the Product Competence Center, Power SBG, Lite-ON Technology Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan, where he has worked on high-efficiency high power-density ac/dc power supplies and high-performance power converters.

Then, steady-state analyses are made to show the merits of the proposed converter module. For closed-loop control design, the corresponding small-signal model is also derived. It is seen that, for higher power applications, more modules can be paralleled to increase the power rating and the dynamic performance. As an illustration, closed-loop control of a 450-W rating converter consisting of two paralleled modules with 24-V input and 200-V output is implemented for demonstration. Experimental results show that the modular high step-up boost converter can achieve an efficiency of 95.8% approximately.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6132606/06074940.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2011.2175473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2011.2175473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6074940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Modular High Step-Up Interleaved Boost Converter for DC-Microgrid Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Capacitors","Switches","Inductors","Steady-state","Integrated circuit modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","distributed power generation","power convertors","voltage multipliers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency modular high step-up interleaved boost converter","DC-microgrid","forward energy-delivering circuit","voltage doubler","steady-state analysis","closed-loop control design","small-signal model","power 450 W","voltage 24 V","voltage 200 V","efficiency 95.8 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC microgrid","high step-up converter","modeling and parallel operation control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Modular High Step-Up Interleaved Boost Converter for DC-Microgrid Applications","volume":"48","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6074940/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12477600","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Modular High Step-Up Interleaved Boost Converter for DC-Microgrid Applications","sourcePdf":"tia-lai-2175473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08588S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6132606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"6132606","articleId":"6074940","onlineDate":"09 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6074943,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Sroubek","affiliation":["Institute of Information Theory and Automation, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6074943/6074943-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Filip \u0160roubek (M'08) received the M.S. degree in computer science from the Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic, in 1998 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Charles University, Prague, in 2003.","From 2004 to 2006, he was on a postdoctoral position with the Instituto de Optica, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.

The memory cell error is reduced by 90% with the asymmetric coding. On the other hand, the inter bit-line capacitance significantly increases with the scaling of memory cells. The bit-line charging current becomes unacceptably large. To decrease the write power consumption, the stripe pattern elimination algorithm (SPEA) is proposed. The SPEA eliminates the column-stripe pattern which consumes the maximum power to charge all of the inter bit-line capacitance in a NAND chip. Theoretical analyses are given for both the asymmetric coding and the SPEA. The asymmetric coding and the SPEA can be used together with the other highly reliable or low power techniques such as intelligent interleaving and adaptive code selection scheme and realizes the high reliability and low power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/6109882/06074961.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6109882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2011.2170637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Reliable and Low Power SSD Using Asymmetric Coding and Stripe Bitline-Pattern Elimination Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6074961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Highly Reliable and Low Power SSD Using Asymmetric Coding and Stripe Bitline-Pattern Elimination Programming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074961/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12425682","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6074961/","volume":"47","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Reliable and Low Power SSD Using Asymmetric Coding and Stripe Bitline-Pattern Elimination Programming","sourcePdf":"jssc-tanakamaru-2170637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104024S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6109882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6109882","articleId":"6074961","onlineDate":"09 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6074962,"authors":[{"name":"Freeman Zhong","affiliation":["LSI Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6079316/6074962/6074962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Freeman Zhong (M\u201900) received the B.S. degree and M.S. degree in physics from Guangzhou University, China, and Jinan University, China, respectively.

The proposed scheme uses a pair of very-high resolution satellite-borne panchromatic and multispectral images and integrates classification results of two parallel and independent analyses, respectively based on spectral and textural information. The multispectral image is divided into spectrally homogeneous but non-contiguous segments using unsupervised classification. In parallel, the panchromatic image is split into a grid of square blocks on which is performed a texture-driven supervised classification. Finally, the spectral and the textural classifications are fused to generate the land-use map. This method contrasts with object-based methods that sequentially perform image segmentation and classification. Results are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, based on field survey ground-truth data.

Visual comparison of the resulting map with the ground-truth is performed, with the analysis of the binary error maps.

Thus, there is a need for the development of computational cost effective algorithms that speed up processing, yet retain essential data quality and information. Endmember extraction is critical in the processing chain of hyperspectral data. Existing methods have primarily been demonstrated on small data sets so their usefulness with large data sets has not been fully explored. The objective of this paper is to adapt the Orthogonal Subspace Projection (OSP) and Spatial Spectral Endmember Extraction (SSEE) algorithms, such that they run efficiently on large data sets without the loss of global image endmember quality. This is demonstrated using a simulated and two real hyperspectral images, the last of which is a multi- flight-line survey. The two adapted methods (OSP SS and SSEE SS) make use of spatial sub-sampling via local endmember extraction to reduce the size of the original data set. This paper will demonstrate that this type of spatial sub-sampling retains the full volume of the data, and thus, the vertices of the simplex that represent the global image endmembers. The results also show that computational time is reduce by more than half using the adapted methods. For the large multi- flight-line survey SSEE SS was able to better retain endmembers of natural materials compared with OSP SS. These results illustrate the potential of spatial sub-sampling for other endmember extraction tools when dealing with multi-flight-line surveys.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

Due to high vehicular speed, sporadic connection, limited communication range, and large volume of data that need to be transmitted, V2G communications have the crucial requirements of fast authentication and encryption/decryption. This paper proposes a unique batch authentication protocol UBAPV2G that takes into account the characteristics of vehicle communication. The performance analysis shows that UBAPV2G can achieve less authentication delay, less computational cost, and less communication traffic, and security analysis shows that UBAPV2G is strong enough to defend against security attacks. The experimental results also demonstrate that UBAPV2G can achieve less authentication delay for large number of packets.

This, in turn, may be leveraged by attackers for consistent financial arbitrage such as virtual bidding at selected pairs of nodes. This paper is a first attempt to formalize the economic impact of malicious data attacks on real-time market operations. We show how an attack could systematically construct a profitable attacking strategy, in the meantime being undetected by the system operator. Such a result is also valuable for the system operators to examine the potential economic loss due to such cyber attack. The potential impact of the false data injection attacks is illustrated on real-time market operations of the IEEE 14-bus system.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2161892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2161892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6084801/06074981.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrity Data Attacks in Power Market Operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Integrity Data Attacks in Power Market Operations","volume":"2","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6074981/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376626","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6074981/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrity Data Attacks in Power Market Operations","sourcePdf":"tsg-xie-2161892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051412S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6084801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"6084801","articleId":"6074981","onlineDate":"09 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6075010,"authors":[{"name":"Ramesh Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Jain","id":"37279812500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1114-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1112-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6075010","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge based systems","next generation networks","sensors","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital expression","digital sharing","mobile phones","next generation networks","real time collective information","knowledge based approach","microblog","chirping sensors","social life networks","SLN"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. Social Networks provide numerous channels for digital expression and sharing with people almost instantaneously in any part of the world. By bringing different media as well as modes of distribution - focused, narrowcast, and broadcast; synchronous as well as asynchronous - social networks have revolutionized communication and connectivity among people. By using the enormous reach of mobile phones equipped with myriads of sensors, the next generation of social networks can be designed to further connect people with essential life resources. This could be accomplished by Real Time Collective Information and Knowledge based approaches to identify where the needs and the resources are and then connecting them. Real time collective information can now be collected by developing frameworks and infrastructure for harnessing information in micro-blogs (e.g. from Twitter and Facebook), from micro-events generated by chirping sensors that are becoming commonplace, and from more than 5 Billion mobile phones for even the remote parts of the planet. We call these networks Social Life Networks (SLN). We believe that SLN have potential to transform how computing, in general, and social networks, in particular, can be used to transform connectivity among people and essential life resources for the people who are in the Middle of the Pyramid. In this presentation we will discuss concepts and motivations related to Social Life Networks and present our approach to building such networks using specific applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICTer.2011.6075010","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6064643/6075003/06075010.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTer.2011.6075010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social Life Networks for the Middle of the Pyramid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075010/","displayDocTitle":"Social Life Networks for the Middle of the Pyramid","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","conferenceDate":"1-2 Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12359309","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social Life Networks for the Middle of the Pyramid","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"08KeyNote01001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017169S","chronDate":"1-2 Sept. 2011","isNumber":"6075003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6064643","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6075010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6075056,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Fei","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed Signal VLSI Laboratory, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Fei","id":"37597666700"},{"name":"Sai-Weng Sin","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed Signal VLSI Laboratory, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Sai-Weng","lastName":"Sin","id":"37269869400"},{"name":"U Seng-Pan","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed Signal VLSI Laboratory, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"U","lastName":"Seng-Pan","id":"38272449500"},{"name":"Rui Paulo Martins","affiliation":["Analog and Mixed Signal VLSI Laboratory, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China","On leave from Instituto Superior Tecnico/TU of Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui Paulo","lastName":"Martins","id":"37272711500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1610-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1608-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1609-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-2160"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-2144"}],"articleNumber":"6075056","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075056","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Gain","Pipelines","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Polynomials","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinearity digital background calibration algorithm","pipelined ADC","opamp sharing architecture","analog-to-digital converters"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new digital background calibration algorithm for 2.5bits/stage pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with opamp sharing architecture.

It is applicable to three-phase four-wire hybrid active power filters (HAPFs), which use four-leg voltage source inverters (VSIs). Different from the conventional controller using instantaneous reactive power theory, the proposed controller could work when source voltages are unbalanced. The bit width and I/O ports of the FPGA-based controller are user-defined. Hence, the proposed FPGA-based controller is more flexible than those using digital signal processors (DSPs).

But its proper function is suffered from crosstalk errors, which is becoming more and more serious with the rapid shrink of the technology. Meanwhile chip in hard environment where full filled with energetic particles such as nuclear power plant, eagerly calls for strong reliability. In this paper, we proposed a coding method for NoC channel, multiple-continuous-error-correct-coding (MCECC) which can strongly correct continuous error bits with 14-bit maximum fault tolerance. Besides, an adaptive error control scheme is proposed to work with this code to enhance the robust communication. Experiments show that the proposed design can reduce nearly 50% wire capacitance energy dissipation and stronger error correcting ability, especially for continuous errors.","publicationTitle":"2011 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068278/6075053/06075080.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple continuous error correct code for high performance network-on-chip","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2011.6075080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2011.6075080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple continuous error correct code for high performance network-on-chip","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360342","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6075080/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple continuous error correct code for high performance network-on-chip","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"D2AM2R621020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058608S","chronDate":"6-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068278","isNumber":"6075053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068278","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6075053","articleId":"6075080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6075086,"authors":[{"name":"Kaichen Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kaichen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37595715700"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37349976200"},{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37289420800"},{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Li","id":"37068214300"},{"name":"Junyan Ren","affiliation":["Micro-/Nano-Electronics Science and Technology Innovation Platform, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junyan","lastName":"Ren","id":"37288701600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1610-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1608-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1609-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-2160"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"CD","value":"2159-2144"}],"articleNumber":"6075086","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance matching","Gain","Wideband","Broadband communication","Topology","CMOS integrated circuits","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","feedback amplifiers","field effect MMIC","impedance matching","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","microwave amplifiers","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low noise amplifier","active balun","multistandard application","LNA","resistive negative feedback stage","wideband input impedance matching","single-to-differential conversion","S2D conversion","RF CMOS process","power consumption","amplifier gain","frequency 0.8 GHz to 10.6 GHz","size 0.13 mum","voltage 1.2 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075086","doi":"10.1109/PrimeAsia.2011.6075086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PrimeAsia.2011.6075086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075053","publicationTitle":"2011 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Asia Pacific Conference on Postgraduate Research in Microelectronics & Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6068278/6075053/06075086.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.13-\u03bcm CMOS 0.8\u201310.6GHz low noise amplifier with active balun for multi-standard applications","abstract":"A CMOS 0.8-10.6 GHz Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with an active balun is proposed for multi-standard applications.

The feasibility study for enhanced spectrum utilization across different cellular technologies considering present regulations have been simulated and results are presented in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360209","htmlLink":"/document/6075105/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of spectrum utilization for existing cellular technologies in context to cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of spectrum utilization for existing cellular technologies in context to cognitive radio","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"104103315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067558S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6067545","isNumber":"6075092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6067545","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6075092","articleId":"6075105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6075111,"authors":[{"name":"Sharanyan Srikanthan","affiliation":["BrahMos AeroSpace Private Limited, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Sharanyan","lastName":"Srikanthan","id":"37717430900"},{"name":"Arvind Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37598655500"},{"name":"Rajeev Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, India"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Gupta","id":"38001192300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1386-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1385-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1384-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6075111","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":510},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Speech","Parallel processing","Euclidean distance","Heuristic algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","multi-threading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multithreaded environment","unsupervised pattern discovery","dynamic time warping","patter recognition","acoustic similarities","speech sequence","image processing","thread-level parallelism","multicore server","multiprocessor server","Intel Xeon processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data parallelism","thread level parallelism","speech recognition and parallel programming"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has been a widely used algorithm in the field of patter recognition. DTW is used to finding acoustic similarities in the same speech sequence or between sequences or both. Its use is not limited to speech signals but it is also a key step in image processing as well. Despite being one of the most important and effective algorithms, DTW is computationally very intense. Processing of one hour of speech using DTW takes a few hours on a single processor, limiting its applicability to desktop and server platforms. Even on advanced platforms, DTW is used only in an offline manner and not in real time. Further modifications for improving performance in DTW make the algorithm slower. In this paper, we aim at extracting maximum thread-level parallelism from the process so as to accelerate its execution using clusters, multicore and multi-processor servers. Since the existing parallelism in this process in highly limited, we restructure the entire algorithm to extract maximum parallelism without altering the functional behavior of the algorithm. We implement the algorithm on a cluster of Intel Xeon processors running at 2.93GHz. We compare the results on a multi processor and multicore level to analyze the benefits of both versions. Our results show that it is possible to implement such a compute intense algorithm in real time which is a big boost considering that these algorithms are always done in an offline manner.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075092","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT-2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT-2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6067545/6075092/06075111.pdf","endPage":"398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing the dynamic time warping algorithm in multithreaded environments for real time and unsupervised pattern discovery","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075111","startPage":"394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Implementing the dynamic time warping algorithm in multithreaded environments for real time and unsupervised pattern discovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075111/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360215","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6075111/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing the dynamic time warping algorithm in multithreaded environments for real time and unsupervised pattern discovery","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"71610380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046345S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6067545","isNumber":"6075092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6067545","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6075092","articleId":"6075111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6075114,"authors":[{"name":"H.

When software prefetching is applied to memory-intensive benchmark programs, the performance improves with higher power consumption. The present work provides a mechanism to transform a program with software prefetching to its power-aware equivalent. This is done by executing the software prefetching program at different voltage-frequency pairs. Besides reducing the power, the performance has been improved by adjusting the prefetch distance. XEEMU-Panalyzer simulator is used to evaluate the present work. Experimental results of the proposed scheme guarantees that performance improvement of software prefetching program is possible at the cost of less power consumption.

In this paper, we propose a technique for optimizing static testing efficiency by identifying the critical path clusters using genetic algorithm. The testing efficiency is optimized by applying the genetic algorithm on the test data. The test case scenarios are derived from the source code.

Since radio frequencies are diminishing natural resources, there seems to be a fundamental barrier to further capacity increase. The solution can be found by using smart antenna systems. Smart or adaptive antenna arrays consist of an array of antenna elements with signal processing capability that optimizes the radiation and reception of a desired signal, dynamically. Smart antenna can place nulls in the direction of interferers via adapting adaptive updating of weights linked to each antenna element. They thus cancel out most of the co-channel interference resulting in better quality of reception and lower dropped calls. Smart antenna can also track the user within a cell via direction of arrival algorithms. This paper focuses on about the smart antenna in hierarchical cell clustering (overlay-underlay) with demand based frequency allocation techniques in cellular mobile radio networks in INDIA.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075092","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT-2011)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Computer and Communication Technology (ICCCT-2011)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6067545/6075092/06075182.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCT.2011.6075182","startPage":"531","endPage":"535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposed cellular network for Indian conditions for enhancement of spectral density and reduction of power consumption & RF pollution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075182/","displayDocTitle":"Proposed cellular network for Indian conditions for enhancement of spectral density and reduction of power consumption & RF pollution","htmlLink":"/document/6075182/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12360285","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposed cellular network for Indian conditions for enhancement of spectral density and reduction of power consumption & RF pollution","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"949582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05341S","chronDate":"15-17 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6067545","isNumber":"6075092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6067545","xplore-issue":"6075092","articleId":"6075182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6075190,"authors":[{"name":"Debashis Chowdhury","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Debashis","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"38015985700"},{"name":"Swapan Kumar.

The method results in a controlled modulated index change with complete suppression of mode coupling associated with the overlapping LPG structure leading to highly symmetric superstructure spectra, with the grating reflection well within the Fourier design limit. The devices are characterized and compared with numerical modeling by solving Maxwell's equations and calculating the back reflection spectrum using the bidirectional beam propagation method (BiBPM). Experimental results validate our numerical analysis, allowing for the estimation of inscription parameters such as the ac index modulation change, and the wavelength, position and relative strength of each significant resonance peak. We also present results on temperature and refractive index measurements showing potential for sensing applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6158728/06075225.pdf","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1236","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2175702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2175702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6158728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superstructure Fiber Gratings Via Single Step Femtosecond Laser Inscription","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fiber gratings","Refractive index","Gratings","Ultrafast optics","Indexes","Fiber lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diffraction gratings","high-speed optical techniques","laser materials processing","numerical analysis","optical fibre fabrication","refractive index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superstructure fiber gratings","single step femtosecond laser inscription","silica optical fiber","sampled gratings","minor polarization dependence","controlled modulated index change","mode coupling","overlapping LPG structure","highly symmetric superstructure spectra","grating reflection","Fourier design limit","numerical modeling","Maxwell's equations","back reflection spectrum","bidirectional beam propagation method","numerical analysis","inscription parameters","ac index modulation change","resonance peak","refractive index measurements","sensing applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber gratings","femtosecond lasers","numerical modeling","optical fiber sensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Superstructure Fiber Gratings Via Single Step Femtosecond Laser Inscription","volume":"30","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6075225/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April15, 2012","accessionNumber":"12637687","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superstructure Fiber Gratings Via Single Step Femtosecond Laser Inscription","sourcePdf":"jlt-davies-2175702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088643S","chronDate":"April15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6158728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6158728","articleId":"6075225","onlineDate":"10 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6075228,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Saad","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6167334/6075228/6075228-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Walid Saad (M'11) received the B.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from the Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2004, the M.E. degree in computer and communications engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Beirut, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, in 2010.","From August 2008 until July 2009, he was a Visiting Scholar in the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

Although each SU has an incentive to sense the primary user (PU) channels for locating spectrum holes, this exploration of the spectrum can come at the expense of a shorter transmission time, and, hence, a possibly smaller capacity for data transmission. This paper investigates the impact of this tradeoff on the cooperative strategies of a network of SUs that seek to cooperate in order to improve their view of the spectrum (sensing), reduce the possibility of interference among each other, and improve their transmission capacity (access). The problem is modeled as a coalitional game in partition form and an algorithm for coalition formation is proposed. Using the proposed algorithm, the SUs can make individual distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition while maximizing their utilities which capture the average time spent for sensing as well as the capacity achieved while accessing the spectrum. It is shown that, by using the proposed algorithm, the SUs can self-organize into a network partition composed of disjoint coalitions, with the members of each coalition cooperating to jointly optimize their sensing and access performance. Simulation results show the performance improvement that the proposed algorithm yields with respect to the noncooperative case. The results also show how the algorithm allows the SUs to self-adapt to changes in the environment such as changes in the traffic of the PUs, or slow mobility.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coalitional Games in Partition Form for Joint Spectrum Sensing and Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2175699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6167334/06075228.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2175699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6167334","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075228","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075228/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Coalitional Games in Partition Form for Joint Spectrum Sensing and Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6075228/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12578202","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coalitional Games in Partition Form for Joint Spectrum Sensing and Access in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-saad-2175699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110108S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6167334","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6167334","articleId":"6075228","onlineDate":"10 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6075229,"authors":[{"name":"Thakshila Wimalajeewa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6130608/6075229/6075229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thakshila Wimalajeewa (S'07\u2013M'10) received the B.

Analyses have shown that the kurtosis method generally detects RFI in an efficient manner, particularly concerning pulsed, low duty cycle signals, but it has some shortcomings when it comes to more continuous wave signal types. Hence, other detection methods have been investigated as well. In particular, inspection of the third and fourth Stokes parameters shows promising results\u2014possibly as a complement to the kurtosis method. The kurtosis method, however, cannot be used with SMOS data. Since SMOS is fully polarimetric, the third and fourth Stokes parameter method is an option, and a first assessment using a fully polarimetric SMOS data set looks promising.

The proposed distributed spatiotemporal NN mimics the functionality of the mammal cerebellum, which is capable of very fast learning and contains features of interpolation. PAs' memory effects are modeled by using linear affine projection on a local function generated by preceding signal inputs. The applicability of the proposed model is validated in the frequency and time domains for forward and reverse modeling using a highly nonlinear Doherty amplifier and a class AB PA driven by wideband code division multiple access and WiMAX signals. The modeling performance is compared with existing techniques to establish it as a successful model that requires a relatively less demanding processing speed and memory requirement during the identification procedure. This model was found to be effective for adaptive applications such as baseband predistortion-based linearization of wireless transmitters.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2170915","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6145766/06075254.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"608","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2170915","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Spatiotemporal Neural Network for Nonlinear Dynamic Transmitter Modeling and Adaptive Digital Predistortion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Spatiotemporal Neural Network for Nonlinear Dynamic Transmitter Modeling and Adaptive Digital Predistortion","volume":"61","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12524371","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6075254/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Spatiotemporal Neural Network for Nonlinear Dynamic Transmitter Modeling and Adaptive Digital Predistortion","sourcePdf":"tim-rawat-2170915-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114346S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6145766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6145766","articleId":"6075254","onlineDate":"10 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6075258,"authors":[{"name":"Mircea-Bogdan Radac","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Politehnica University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea-Bogdan","lastName":"Radac","id":"37569790300"},{"name":"Radu-Emil Precup","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Politehnica University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu-Emil","lastName":"Precup","id":"37301187100"},{"name":"Emil M.

The representative case of controlled processes modeled by second-order systems with an integral component is discussed. New IFT and SPSA algorithms are suggested to tune the parameters of the state feedback controllers with an integrator in the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem formulation. An implementation case study concerning the LQG-based design of an angular position controller for a direct current servo system laboratory equipment is included to highlight the pros and cons of IFT and SPSA from an application's point of view.

The formulation obtained from the high-frequency model based on the Tsypkin's method explicitly shows the relation between the maximum switching frequency with the system and design parameters. The shunt compensator has been used for the load compensation in a distribution system for both weak and strong feeder supplying a nonlinear load. The maximum switching frequency has been shown related with hysteresis bandwidth and parameters of the VSI, feeder, and load of the distribution system. It is shown that the feeder and load reactance has a significant effect in determining the maximum switching frequency for the weak feeder distribution systems. However, the maximum switching frequency is mainly dependent upon the shunt compensator parameters for strong feeder distribution systems. The minimum switching frequency in general depends upon the modulation depth of the VSI. The results are verified using as power systems CAD (PSCAD) simulation studies for single-phase load compensation. A laboratory model distribution system has been used for the experimental verification.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2175750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6159241/06075261.pdf","startPage":"2526","endPage":"2535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2175750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6159241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Frequency Domain Formulation of the Switching Frequency for Hysteresis Current Controlled VSI Used for Load Compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075261/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Frequency Domain Formulation of the Switching Frequency for Hysteresis Current Controlled VSI Used for Load Compensation","volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12571282","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6075261/","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Frequency Domain Formulation of the Switching Frequency for Hysteresis Current Controlled VSI Used for Load Compensation","sourcePdf":"tpel-gupta-2175750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086456S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6159241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6159241","articleId":"6075261","onlineDate":"10 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6075278,"authors":[{"name":"Mark S.

This is not only important for lab equipment, but also for the spectrum sensing part of cognitive radio, where low cost and integration is at a premium. Often there is a trade-off between linearity and noise: improving one degrades the other. Crosscorrelation can break this trade-off by reducing noise at the expense of measurement time. An existing RF frontend in CMOS-technology with IIP3 = +11 dBm and NF = 5.5 dB is duplicated and attenuators are put in front to increase linearity to IIP3 = +24 dBm. The attenuation degrades NF, but by using crosscorrelation of the outputs of the two frontends, the effective NF is reduced to around 5 dB. In total, this results in a spurious-free dynamic range of 88 dB in 1 MHz resolution bandwidth.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155677","startPage":"479","endPage":"492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6155677/06075278.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS-Compatible Spectrum Analyzer for Cognitive Radio Exploiting Crosscorrelation to Improve Linearity and Noise Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6075278/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A CMOS-Compatible Spectrum Analyzer for Cognitive Radio Exploiting Crosscorrelation to Improve Linearity and Noise Performance","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556357","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS-Compatible Spectrum Analyzer for Cognitive Radio Exploiting Crosscorrelation to Improve Linearity and Noise Performance","sourcePdf":"tcsi-alink-2167266-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100966S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6155677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6155677","articleId":"6075278","onlineDate":"10 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6075285,"authors":[{"name":"Maggie Yihong Chen","affiliation":["Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University, San Marcos, San Marcos, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6112732/6075285/6075285-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maggie Yihong Chen (M'03\u2013SM'08) received the B.S. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, in 1993, 1996, and 2002, respectively.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with Texas State University (TSU), San Marcos.

Passive and active components, such as microstrip transmission lines, phase shifters, and RF power distribution networks are all developed adopting a room-temperature printing process. The PAA working at 5.2 GHz is printed on flexible DuPont Kapton flexible printed circuit polyimide film to demonstrate the conformal nature. High-speed carbon-nanotube-based field-effect transistors (FETs) function as switches to route the RF signal go through different segments of the true-time delay lines. The FET switch exhibits an on-off ratio of over 1000 and current of 3.6 mA is obtained at a low source-drain bias of 0.8 V. The 2-bit azimuth beamsteering angles of the PAA are measured and confirmed to agree well with simulation values.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6112732/06075285.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2173209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2173209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6075285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conformal Ink-Jet Printed --Band Phased-Array Antenna Incorporating Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistor Based Reconfigurable True-Time Delay Lines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Transmission line measurements","FETs","Logic gates","Delay lines","Materials","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","carbon nanotube field effect transistors","delay lines","field effect transistor switches","ink jet printing","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conformal ink-jet printing","C-band phased array antenna","carbon nanotube","field effect transistor","reconfigurable true time delay lines","active components","passive components","flexible DuPont Kapton flexible printed circuit","FET switch","on-off ratio","azimuth beamsteering angles","PAA","frequency 5.2 GHz","current 3.6 mA","voltage 0.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon nanotube (CNT)","conformal antennas","field-effect transistor (FET) switches","ink-jet printing","phased-array antennas (PAAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Conformal Ink-Jet Printed <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$C$</tex></formula>-Band Phased-Array Antenna Incorporating Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistor Based Reconfigurable True-Time Delay Lines","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6075285/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12427048","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conformal Ink-Jet Printed <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$C$</tex></formula>-Band Phased-Array Antenna Incorporating Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistor Based Reconfigurable True-Time Delay Lines","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chen-2173209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056729S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6112732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6112732","articleId":"6075285","onlineDate":"10 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6075299,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper describes a new efficient pruning method, the multi-weight optimal brain surgeon (MWOBS) method, to optimize neural network topologies. The advantages and disadvantages of the OBS and unit-OBS were analyzed to develop the method. Actually, optimized topologies are difficult to get within reasonable times for complex problems. Motivating by the mechanism of natural neurons, the MW-OBS method balances the accuracy and the time complexity to achieve better neural network performance. The method will delete multiple connections among neurons according to the second derivative of the error function, so the arithmetic converges rapidly while the accuracy of the neural network remains high. The stability and generalization ability of the method are illustrated in a Java program. The results show that the MWOBS method has the same accuracy as OBS, but time is similar to that of unit-OBS. Therefore, the MWOBS method can be used to efficiently optimize structures of neural networks for large scale applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6075894/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2006","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MW-OBS: An improved pruning method for topology design of neural networks","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"MW-OBS: An improved pruning method for topology design of neural networks","sourcePdf":"307312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067709S","chronDate":"June  2006","isNumber":"6075885","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6075894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6076011,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Ding"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6076011","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":519},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076011","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Detectors","Face detection","Training","Real time systems","Estimation","Training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face detection","pose estimation","multi-view face detection","AdaBoost"]}],"doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(05)70047-X","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6076005/06076011.pdf","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","startPage":"152","endPage":"157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(05)70047-X","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time multi-view face detection and pose estimation based on cost-sensitive AdaBoost","abstract":"Locating multi-view faces in images with a complex background remains a challenging problem.

Experimental results show that the proposed multi-view face detector, which can be constructed easily, gives more robust face detection and pose estimation and has a faster real-time detection speed compared with other conventional methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2005","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2005","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-time multi-view face detection and pose estimation based on cost-sensitive AdaBoost","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Real-time multi-view face detection and pose estimation based on cost-sensitive AdaBoost","sourcePdf":"152157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020786S","chronDate":"April  2005","isNumber":"6076005","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6076011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6076013,"authors":[{"name":"Wanchun Fei","affiliation":["Material Engineering College, Soochow University, Suzhou 215021, China; Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Wanchun","lastName":"Fei"},{"name":"Lun Bai","affiliation":["Material Engineering College, Soochow University, Suzhou 215021, China"],"firstName":"Lun","lastName":"Bai"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6076013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1362},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Biological system modeling","Analytical models","Least squares methods","Educational institutions","White noise","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time series analysis","auto-covariance","non-stationary","auto-regressive model","size curve of cocoon filament"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076013","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6076005/06076013.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(05)70049-3","doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(05)70049-3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076005","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auto-regressive models of non-stationary time series with finite length","abstract":"To analyze and simulate non-stationary time series with finite length, the statistical characteristics and auto-regressive (AR) models of non-stationary time series with finite length are discussed and studied.

The proposed algorithm for increase of convergence speed has been adaptive configured by inertia weight value and to improve obtained solutions uses from a local search and to avoid wasting function evaluation of stopped swarms. To improve the search performance, when the search areas of two swarms are overlapped, the worse swarms will be removed. Moreover, in order to track quickly the changes in the environment, all particles in the swarm convert to quantum particles when a change in the environment is detected.

In this study, the proposed algorithm translated a given prior knowledge and the available samples into a function space before introducing the idea of Pareto optimality concept to the problem. Instead of a single optimal solution competing with the objectives, the algorithm provides a set of solutions, generally denoted as the Pareto-optimal that offers more flexibility towards the intended solution. Thus the corresponding trade-off between solutions can be chosen in the presence of preference information. The proposed technique also does not require the addition of equality or non-equality constraints in introducing a prior knowledge.

This paper presents an analysis and simulation of HQAM in order to bring out its merits over QAM. The simulation is carried out using MATLAB & Simulink for different values of modulation parameter.

A system consisting of one-source-one-destination pair and N-multihop relay nodes is studied. The system under investigation is suitable for a network of nodes with low power or widely spread nodes, where transmitted signal can reach its first tier nodes only. While signal degrades and doesn't reach second tier neighbors. Therefore, unlike previous work in the literature, this paper studies a system where no direct link between the source and the destination node. A new proposed detection scheme using the maximum ratio combiner (MRC) is designed for such a network with uncertain channel links. It is applied at the destination to optimally detect the originally transmitted message from the source. Using the new proposed MRC detection scheme, Monte-Carlo simulation results are presented to evaluate the bit error rate (BER) for this system under study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

It is a tool to verify the design's behaviour in case of fault attacks and to verify implemented countermeasures. The environment is script-based for fully automated modification of the digital design and simulation. It can handle designs in VHDL as well as in Verilog language and does not require modifications to the design's source code.

Most of these attacks target the AES with 128-bit key. However, the two other variants are nowadays deployed in various applications and are also submitted to the same attack path. In this paper, we adapt DFA techniques originally used on AES-128 in order to retrieve the whole keys of AES-192 and AES-256. The two main kinds of injection localization have been analyzed: faults during cipher and during Key Expansion computations. Analysis of this last case highlights different fault diffusion problems requiring to be solved to exploit the differential faults. Finally, we propose the first attack on AES-192 and AES-256 on Key Expansion. This attack leads finding the whole initial key with 16 fault injections in both cases.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2011.15","publicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075045/6076451/06076466.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2011.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From AES-128 to AES-192 and AES-256, How to Adapt Differential Fault Analysis Attacks on Key Expansion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"From AES-128 to AES-192 and AES-256, How to Adapt Differential Fault Analysis Attacks on Key Expansion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360587","htmlLink":"/document/6076466/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From AES-128 to AES-192 and AES-256, How to Adapt Differential Fault Analysis Attacks on Key Expansion","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"4526a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057447S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075045","isNumber":"6076451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075045","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6076451","articleId":"6076466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6076469,"authors":[{"name":"Kazim Yumbul","affiliation":["Gebze Institute of Technology, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kazim","lastName":"Yumbul","id":"38109641600"},{"name":"Serdar Suer Erdem","affiliation":["Gebze Institute of Technology, Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Serdar Suer","lastName":"Erdem","id":"37871190000"},{"name":"Erkay Savas","affiliation":["Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erkay","lastName":"Savas","id":"38202380000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1463-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076469","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076469","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Cryptography","Registers","Computer architecture","Circuit faults","Software","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","error detection codes","microcomputers","public key cryptography","reconfigurable architectures","residue codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic application protection","fault attacks","error detection codes","quadratic dual residue codes","general-purpose microprocessor cores","bit flipping","single-precision arithmetic operations","public key cryptography algorithms","multiplication operations","addition operations","embedded reconfigurable processor","Montgomery multiplication algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Cryptographic Algorithms","Fault Attacks","Error Detection","Instruction Set Extensions","Computer Architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2011.14","publicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075045/6076451/06076469.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2011.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Protecting Cryptographic Applications Against Fault Attacks Using Residue Codes","abstract":"We propose a new class of error detection codes, {\\em quadratic dual residue codes}, to protect cryptographic computations running on general-purpose processor cores against fault attacks. The assumed adversary model is a powerful one, whereby the attacker can inject errors anywhere in the data path of a general-purpose microprocessor by bit flipping. We demonstrate that quadratic dual residue codes provide a much better protection under this powerful adversary model compared to similar codes previously proposed for the same purpose in the literature. The adopted strategy aims to protect the single-precision arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, which usually dominate the execution time of many public key cryptography algorithms in general-purpose microprocessors. Two so called {\\em robust} units for addition and multiplication operations, which provide a protection against faults attacks, are designed and tightly integrated into the data path of a simple, embedded re-configurable processor. We report the implementation results that compare the proposed error detection codes favorably with previous proposals of similar type in the literature. In addition, we present performance evaluations of the software implementations of Montgomery multiplication algorithm using the robust execution units. Implementation results clearly show that it is feasible to implement robust arithmetic units with relatively low overhead even for a simple embedded processor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076469/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360590","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On Protecting Cryptographic Applications Against Fault Attacks Using Residue Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Protecting Cryptographic Applications Against Fault Attacks Using Residue Codes","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"4526a069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077912S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075045","isNumber":"6076451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075045","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6076451","articleId":"6076469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076470,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Mozaffari-Kermani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Mozaffari-Kermani","id":"38274063800"},{"name":"Arash Reyhani-Masoleh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Reyhani-Masoleh","id":"38277977100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1463-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076470","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076470","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Polynomials","Hardware","Complexity theory","Computer architecture","Delay","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","cryptography","fault diagnosis","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance fault diagnosis approach","AES subbytes","mixed bases","nonlinear transformation","advanced encryption standard","hardware architectures","S-boxes","high-speed architecture","malicious faults","CHES 2010","fault detection scheme","ASIC synthesis","CMOS technology","hardware complexity","polynomial bases","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault detection","mixed bases","multi-bit parity","S-box"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2011.11","publicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075045/6076451/06076470.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2011.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance Fault Diagnosis Approach for the AES SubBytes Utilizing Mixed Bases","abstract":"The Sub Bytes (S-boxes) is the only non-linear transformation in the encryption of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), occupying more than half of its hardware implementation resources. One important required aspect of the hardware architectures of the S-boxes is the reliability of their implementations. This can be compromised by occurrence of internal faults or intrusion of the attackers. In this paper, we present a high-speed architecture for the S-boxes constructed using mixed bases to counteract these internal/malicious faults. Although using polynomial and normal bases for the S-boxes has been studied extensively, using mixed bases has just been considered very recently in CHES 2010. In the proposed fault detection scheme of this paper, we present formulations for multi-bit parities for the S-boxes using mixed bases. Then, these formulations are utilized in our error simulations and it is shown that the presented architecture reaches very high error coverage. Through our ASIC syntheses utilizing a 65-nm CMOS technology, we show that with comparable hardware complexity, the efficiency of the presented reliable architecture (without sub-pipelining) reaches around 5.02 Mbps/\u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, outperforming other fault detection schemes for composite field architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076470/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360591","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance Fault Diagnosis Approach for the AES SubBytes Utilizing Mixed Bases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance Fault Diagnosis Approach for the AES SubBytes Utilizing Mixed Bases","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"4526a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072035S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075045","isNumber":"6076451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075045","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6076451","articleId":"6076470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076471,"authors":[{"name":"Jasper G.J. van Woudenberg","affiliation":["Riscure, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jasper G.J.","lastName":"van Woudenberg","id":"38228586200"},{"name":"Marc F.

We observe that the effects of fault injection on two-stage pipeline devices are more complex than commonly reported in the literature. While injecting a fault is relatively easy, injecting an exploitable fault is hard. We further observe that the easiest to inject and reliable fault is to replace instructions, and that random faults do not occur. Finally we explain how typical fault attacks can be mounted on this device, and describe a new attack for which the fault injection is easy and the cryptanalysis trivial.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076451","publicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075045/6076451/06076473.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2011.9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2011.9","startPage":"105","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An In-depth and Black-box Characterization of the Effects of Clock Glitches on 8-bit MCUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076473/","displayDocTitle":"An In-depth and Black-box Characterization of the Effects of Clock Glitches on 8-bit MCUs","htmlLink":"/document/6076473/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12360594","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An In-depth and Black-box Characterization of the Effects of Clock Glitches on 8-bit MCUs","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"4526a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065558S","chronDate":"28-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075045","isNumber":"6076451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075045","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6076451","articleId":"6076473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6076495,"authors":[{"name":"Eugen Feller","affiliation":["INRIA Centre Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Eugen","lastName":"Feller","id":"37846586500"},{"name":"Louis Rilling","affiliation":["KerLaboratories, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Rilling","id":"37565799900"},{"name":"Christine Morin","affiliation":["INRIA Centre Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Morin","id":"37284788700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4572-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1904-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-1093"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-1085"}],"articleNumber":"6076495","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":184,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1040},"abstract":"With increasing numbers of energy hungry data centers energy conservation has now become a major design constraint. One traditional approach to conserve energy in virtualized data centers is to perform workload (i.e., VM) consolidation. Thereby, workload is packed on the least number of physical machines and over-provisioned resources are transitioned into a lower power state. However, most of the workload consolidation approaches applied until now are limited to a single resource (e.g., CPU) and rely on simple greedy algorithms such as First-Fit Decreasing (FFD), which perform resource-dissipative workload placement. Moreover, they are highly centralized and known to be hard to distribute. In this work, we model the workload consolidation problem as an instance of the multi-dimensional bin-packing (MDBP) problem and design a novel, nature-inspired workload consolidation algorithm based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We evaluate the ACO-based approach by comparing it with one frequently applied greedy algorithm (i.e., FFD). Our simulation results demonstrate that ACO outperforms the evaluated greedy algorithm as it achieves superior energy gains through better server utilization and requires less machines. Moreover, it computes solutions which are nearly optimal. Finally, the autonomous nature of the approach allows it to be implemented in a fully distributed environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075048/6076475/06076495.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing","doi":"10.1109/Grid.2011.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Grid.2011.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Ant Colony Based Workload Placement in Clouds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Estimation","Heuristic algorithms","Greedy algorithms","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bin packing","cloud computing","computer centres","energy conservation","greedy algorithms","optimisation","power aware computing","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware ant colony","ant colony based workload placement","energy hungry data center","energy conservation","workload consolidation approach","greedy algorithm","first-fit decreasing algorithm","resource-dissipative workload placement","multidimensional bin-packing problem","ant colony optimization","cloud computing","virtualized data center"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ant Colony Optimization","Combinatorial Optimization","Green Cloud Computing","Multidimensional Bin Packing","Swarm Intelligence","Virtualization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Ant Colony Based Workload Placement in Clouds","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076495/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360687","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Ant Colony Based Workload Placement in Clouds","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"4572a026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107938S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075048","isNumber":"6076475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075048","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6076475","articleId":"6076495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6076508,"authors":[{"name":"Astrid Undheim","affiliation":["Corporate Development, Telenor ASA, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Astrid","lastName":"Undheim","id":"37293871900"},{"name":"Ameen Chilwan","affiliation":["Department of Telematics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Ameen","lastName":"Chilwan","id":"38229382000"},{"name":"Poul Heegaard","affiliation":["Department of Telematics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Poul","lastName":"Heegaard","id":"37399205000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4572-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1904-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-1093"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-1085"}],"articleNumber":"6076508","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":948},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Cloud computing","Hardware","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","fault tolerant computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing SLA","service delivery","cloud data center","failure rate","fault-tolerance technique","virtual machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Availability","cloud","differentiation","SLA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076508","abstract":"Cloud computing is the new trend in service delivery, and promises large cost savings and agility for the customers. However, some challenges still remain to be solved before widespread use can be seen. This is especially relevant for enterprises, which currently lack the necessary assurance for moving their critical data and applications to the cloud. The cloud SLAs are simply not good enough. This paper focuses on the availability attribute of a cloud SLA, and develops a complete model for cloud data centers, including the network. Different techniques for increasing the availability in a virtualized system are investigated, quantifying the resulting availability. The results show that depending on the failure rates, different deployment scenarios and fault-tolerance techniques can be used for achieving availability differentiation. However, large differences can be seen from using different priority levels for restarting of virtual machines.","doi":"10.1109/Grid.2011.25","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075048/6076475/06076508.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Grid.2011.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiated Availability in Cloud Computing SLAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Differentiated Availability in Cloud Computing SLAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076508/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360700","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differentiated Availability in Cloud Computing SLAs","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"4572a129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075395S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075048","isNumber":"6076475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075048","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6076475","articleId":"6076508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6076514,"authors":[{"name":"Shunsuke Mikami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Mikami","id":"37901863000"},{"name":"Kazuki Ohta","affiliation":["Preferred Infrastructure, Inc., Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuki","lastName":"Ohta","id":"37069665400"},{"name":"Osamu Tatebe","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Japan Science and Technology Agency, CREST, University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Tatebe","id":"37565852400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4572-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1904-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-1093"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-1085"}],"articleNumber":"6076514","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":523},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076514","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Benchmark testing","File systems","Distributed databases","Google","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","file organisation","parallel programming","public domain software","Unix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gfarm file system","POSIX compatible storage platform","Hadoop MapReduce applications","parallel programming","data sets","HDFS","output data","open source distributed file systems","portable operating system interface based on UNIX"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MapReduce","Hadoop","Gfarm","Distributed file system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/Grid.2011.31","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/ACM 12th International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075048/6076475/06076514.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Grid.2011.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Gfarm File System as a POSIX Compatible Storage Platform for Hadoop MapReduce Applications","abstract":"MapReduce is a promising parallel programming model for processing large data sets. Hadoop is an up-and-coming open-source implementation of MapReduce. It uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) to store input and output data. Due to a lack of POSIX compatibility, it is difficult for existing software to directly access data stored in HDFS. Therefore, it is not possible to share storage between existing software and MapReduce applications. In order for external applications to process data using MapReduce, we must first import the data, process it, then export the output data into a POSIX compatible file system. This results in a large number of redundant file operations. In order to solve this problem we propose using Gfarm file system instead of HDFS. Gfarm is a POSIX compatible distributed file system and has similar architecture to HDFS. We design and implement of Hadoop-Gfarm plug-in which enables Hadoop MapReduce to access files on Gfarm efficiently. We compared the MapReduce workload performance of HDFS, Gfarm, PVFS and Gluster FS, which are open-source distributed file systems. Our various evaluations show that Gfarm performed just as well as Hadoop's native HDFS. In most evaluations, Gfarm performed bettar than twice as well as PVFS and Gluster FS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076514/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360706","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using the Gfarm File System as a POSIX Compatible Storage Platform for Hadoop MapReduce Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Gfarm File System as a POSIX Compatible Storage Platform for Hadoop MapReduce Applications","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"4572a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089487S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075048","isNumber":"6076475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075048","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6076475","articleId":"6076514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6076530,"authors":[{"name":"Xingfu Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Xingfu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537470200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9954-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4339-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2330-9857"}],"articleNumber":"6076530","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Measurement","Vectors","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Image recognition","Algorithm design and analysis","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","Laplace equations","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","Mahalanobis distance metric based Laplacian mapping algorithm","MLMA","Mahalanobis metric matrix","USPS databases","ORL databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["laplacian mapping","manifold learning","dimensionality reduction","image recognition"]}],"abstract":"An Improved algorithm for image recognition, called Mahalanobis Distance Metric based Laplacian Mapping Algorithm(MLMA), is presented in this paper.

However, as all the femtocells use the same radio band, it poses a serious interference issue amongst neighboring femtocells, especially when femtocells are densely deployed. In this paper, we study the problem of DL (downlink) and UL (uplink) interference amongst closed-access neighboring femtocells used in conjunction with the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology and propose a solution to mitigate this interference using Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) technique. User equipments (UEs) report to their serving femto base stations (F-BSs) periodically. If the report reveals high interference level, neighboring F-BSs locally adopt FFR in a coordinated but decentralized way. FFR divides the femtocell in cell-center and cell-edge areas where the cell-edge of interfering F-BSs use distinct set of sub-carriers (SCs). The division takes place in a way such that the affected UE falls in the cell-edge area. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme decreases interference in the neighboring F-BSs, femto UEs (F-UEs) and macro UEs (M-UEs) and improves the overall throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Frequency Reuse to Mitigate Interference in Self-Configuring LTE-Femtocells Network","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.138","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076590.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Frequency Reuse to Mitigate Interference in Self-Configuring LTE-Femtocells Network","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076590/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360813","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Frequency Reuse to Mitigate Interference in Self-Configuring LTE-Femtocells Network","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058681S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076591,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Xin","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Xin","id":"37276378400"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293614100"},{"name":"Jiannong Cao","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jiannong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277630700"},{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Feng","id":"37405914800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076591","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Quality of service","Routing","Signal to noise ratio","Equations","Approximation algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","computational complexity","greedy algorithms","optimisation","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network routing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint admission control","channel assignment","QoS routing","multihop cognitive radio cellular networks","secondary users","primary users","PU","SU","multihop infrastructure-based secondary systems","multiple access channels","transmission reliability","CogCell system","multihop secondary transmissions","interference constraints","NP-hard","coverage optimization problem","approximation ratio","greedy heuristic approximation scheme","polylogarithmic approximation ratio","polylogarithmic factor"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Admission Control, Channel Assignment and QoS Routing for Coverage Optimization in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Cellular Networks","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.17","startPage":"55","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076591","abstract":"In recent years, cognitive radio technology (CR) has been proposed to allow unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically access the channels unused by primary users. As a result, there is a lot of recent interests on studying cognitive radio cellular networks (CogCells) that can support both PUs and SUs. Due to the limited transmission range of SUs, in this work we consider supporting Multi-hop infrastructure-based secondary systems (SSs), where SUs can communicate with the BS over multiple hops. The use of SSs improves the reliability and coverage compared to its single-hop counterpart. In addition, SUs are allowed to access multiple channels, which helps to increase transmission reliability and coverage and relieve interference at PUs. To enable multi-hop secondary transmissions, it is also important to support efficient routing. In CogCells, efficient admission control, channel assignment and routing is crucial for the coverage optimization of SSs and to ensure the QoS requirements in CogCells. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the problem of joint admission control, channel assignment and QoS routing to maximize the coverage of SUs in a CogCell system that supports multi-hop secondary transmissions, taking into account the interference constraints and QoS requirements from the PUs and admitted SUs. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to optimize the coverage of SUs in multi-hop CogCells with the concurrent support of the above three important procedures. We show that the problem is NP-hard and propose three different algorithms to solve the coverage optimization problem and give the theoretical analyses of its performances in terms of approximation ratio to the optimum. Our solutions include a greedy heuristic approximation scheme, an algorithm that can provide exact solution, and a new approximation solution with a poly-logarithmic approximation ratio guarantee, e.g., the performance of our algorithm is within a poly-logarithmic factor of that of any optimal algorithm for the problem. Our preliminary simulation results indicate that our new approximation algorithms can effectively exploit the increased number of SUs and channels, and performs much better than the theoretical worst case bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360814","htmlLink":"/document/6076591/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Admission Control, Channel Assignment and QoS Routing for Coverage Optimization in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Admission Control, Channel Assignment and QoS Routing for Coverage Optimization in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115857S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076592,"authors":[{"name":"Jasvinder Singh","affiliation":["Nimbus Centre of Embedded System Research, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Jasvinder","lastName":"Singh","id":"37271346100"},{"name":"Dirk Pesch","affiliation":["Nimbus Centre of Embedded System Research, Cork Institute of Technology, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Pesch","id":"37271619300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076592","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076592","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Fading","Energy efficiency","Fuzzy logic","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","fuzzy control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient adaptive error control","indoor WSN","fuzzy logic based approach","radio signal quality","radio interferences","energy consumption","resource-restricted wireless nodes","forward error correction","line-of-sight-non-line-of-sight detection","ACK-NACK","low-power link quality","packet transmissions","AFECCC","adaptive FEC code control schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WSN","Forward Error Correction (FEC)","Fuzzy","Adaptive FEC","BCH codes"]}],"abstract":"In populated indoor environments, the radio signal quality is heavily influenced by channel impairments caused by movement of people, obstacles, or radio interferences. In such environments, high packet drop rates lead to frequent retransmissions and increased energy consumption of resource-restricted wireless nodes. To overcome this, we propose a novel Forward Error Correction (FEC) based adaptive error control strategy that employs a cascaded fuzzy inference system to combat communication unreliability. The strategy unifies various heterogeneous metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio, line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight detection and ACK/NACK to closely estimate the low-power links' quality and based on that, selects an appropriate FEC code to protect packet transmissions. Numerical evaluations are carried out using a realistic indoor fading channel model and IEEE 802.15.4 2.4 GHz modulation format. The performance results obtained from a comparative analysis with static and Adaptive FEC Code Control schemes (AFECCC) conclude that the proposed adaptive scheme guarantees better trade-off (packet error rate and energy-efficiency) for indoor WSN applications.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.18","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076592.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Energy Efficient Adaptive Error Control in Indoor WSN: A Fuzzy Logic Based Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Towards Energy Efficient Adaptive Error Control in Indoor WSN: A Fuzzy Logic Based Approach","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076592/","accessionNumber":"12360815","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Energy Efficient Adaptive Error Control in Indoor WSN: A Fuzzy Logic Based Approach","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071347S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6076593,"authors":[{"name":"Fachang Jiang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fachang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37708082800"},{"name":"Shibo He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shibo","lastName":"He","id":"37405849000"},{"name":"Peng Cheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37287113500"},{"name":"Jiming Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076593","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":620},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076593","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Optimal scheduling","Wireless communication","Mathematical model","Mobile communication","Monitoring","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","stochastic processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless rechargeable sensor network","stochastic event capture","energy-harvesting sensor node","human activity recognition","embedded infrastructure sensing","WRSN","optimal scheduling problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal Scheduling","Wireless Recharge Sensor Networks","Stochastic Event Capture"]}],"abstract":"Recently, wireless recharging technologies have merged as a promising approach to address the energy constraint problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

However, due to the unpredictable node mobility in DTNs, traditional caching schemes cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose DAC, a novel caching protocol adaptive to the challenging environment of DTNs. Specifically, we exploit the social community structure to combat the unstable network topology in DTNs. We propose a new centrality metric to evaluate the caching capability of each node within a community, and solutions based on this metric are proposed to determine where to cache. More importantly, we consider the impact of the contact duration limitation on cooperative caching, which has been ignored by the existing works. We prove that the marginal caching benefit that a node can provide diminishes when more data is cached. We derive an adaptive caching bound for each mobile node according to its specific contact patterns with others, to limit the amount of data it caches.

High-end mobile phones and laptops double their mobile data traffic every year and this trend is expected to continue given the rapid development of mobile social applications. It is imperative that novel architectures be developed to handle such voluminous mobile data. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an integrated architecture exploiting the opportunistic networking paradigm to migrate data traffic from cellular networks to metropolitan WiFi access points (APs). To quantify the benefits of deploying such an architecture, we consider the case of bulk file transfer and video streaming over 3G networks and simulate data delivery using real mobility data set of 500 taxis in an urban area. We are the first to quantitatively evaluate the gains of city-wide WiFi offloading using large scale real traces. Our results give the numbers of APs needed for different requirements of quality of service for data delivery in large metropolitan area. We show that even with a sparse WiFi network the delivery performance can be significantly improved. This effort serves as an important feasibility study and provides guidelines for operators to evaluate the possibility and cost of this solution.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.26","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076617.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular Traffic Offloading through WiFi Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cellular Traffic Offloading through WiFi Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360840","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076617/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076617/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular Traffic Offloading through WiFi Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055347S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6076618,"authors":[{"name":"Nikodin Ristanovic","affiliation":["EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nikodin","lastName":"Ristanovic","id":"37847240300"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Le Boudec","affiliation":["EPFL, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Le Boudec","id":"37295574000"},{"name":"Augustin Chaintreau","affiliation":["Columbia University, USA"],"firstName":"Augustin","lastName":"Chaintreau","id":"37295188700"},{"name":"Vijay Erramilli","affiliation":["Telefonica, Spain"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Erramilli","id":"37542193700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076618","dbTime":"74 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":883},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Mobile communication","Smart phones","Switches","Delay","Mobile computing","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","ad hoc networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient offloading","3G networks","smartphones","mobile operators","mobile data traffic","AT&T network","data networks","ad hoc transfers","HotZones algorithm","delay tolerance","Wi-Fi access points","Apple ping music social network","mobile energy efficiency","MixZones algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3G offloading","delay tolerant networks","mobility prediction"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Offloading of 3G Networks","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","endPage":"211","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.27","startPage":"202","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076618","abstract":"The increase in data consumed by smartphones is becoming a huge problem for mobile operators. In three years, mobile data traffic in AT&T's network rose 5000%. The US operators invest $50 billion in the data networks every year and the technology upgrades and innovation still fail to keep up with the demand. In this paper we design two algorithms for delay-tolerant offloading of bulky, socially recommended content from 3G networks. The first one, called \"MixZones\", uses opportunistic, ad hoc transfers between users, and is assisted by predictions made by the network operator. The second one, called \"HotZones\", exploits delay tolerance and tries to download contents when users are close to Wi-Fi access points; it is also assisted by predictions made by the operator. We evaluate both algorithms using a large data set, obtained from a major mobile operator and a realistic application similar to Apple's Ping music social network. The metrics address the amount of offloading, delay and mobile energy efficiency. We find that both solutions succeed in offloading a significant amount of traffic, with a positive impact on user battery lifetime. Surprisingly, we also find that all the benefit obtained from the operator with the MixZones algorithm (i.e with ad hoc exchanges between users) can be achieved with the HotZones algorithm and a small investment in Wi-Fi access points. Note that the latter is considerably less complex to deploy than the former.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360841","htmlLink":"/document/6076618/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Offloading of 3G Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Offloading of 3G Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137688S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6076619,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxing Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hongxing","lastName":"Li","id":"37067569200"},{"name":"Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37532641000"},{"name":"Chuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37308270500"},{"name":"Zongpeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Zongpeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37309823800"},{"name":"Francis C.M.

Even under the assumption that all secondary users are fully collaborative, the optimization requires cross-layer decision making which is challenging. The challenge escalates if users are socially selfish, who prefer to relay data only to those other users with whom there are social ties. Such social selfishness of users translates into new constraints on network protocol design. There has been no study so far on the impact of social selfishness on data dissemination in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we consider social selfishness of secondary users, and propose the design of a joint end-to-end rate control, routing, and channel allocation protocol which can maximize the overall throughput utility of multi-session unicast in cognitive radio networks. We give a distributed implementation of the protocol. Based on a Lyapunov optimization framework, we address social preferences of users using differentiated buffer sizes and relay rates for different data sessions, and apply back-pressure based transmission scheduling to achieve guaranteed utility optimality. A unique contribution of our Lyapunov optimization is that only a finite-sized buffer is required at each user node, which sets our design apart from other designs in existing literature where they assume infinite buffers. We investigate the the optimality of our protocol and the impact of user social selfishness using both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360842","htmlLink":"/document/6076619/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Utility-Maximizing Data Dissemination in Socially Selfish Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-Maximizing Data Dissemination in Socially Selfish Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082839S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6076650,"authors":[{"name":"Ramzi Saifan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Ramzi","lastName":"Saifan","id":"37540395500"},{"name":"Ahmed E.

The model enables the CR node to benefit from its previous measurements. It assumes that there are multi-idle states, each with specific length and known probability of staying in it. We used this model to find the best sensing time, energy detection threshold, and false alarm probability of the channel being sensed in monitoring. Also, we developed an out-of-band optimization formulation.

Through calculated preceding, SA contracts the perceived signal space at a node to match its receive diversity, and hence facilitates the demodulation of linearly combined data packets. PNC coupled with SA (PNC-SA) has the potential of fully exploiting the preceding space at the senders, and can better utilize the spatial diversity of a MIMO network for higher transmission rates, outperforming existing techniques including MIMO or PNC alone, interference alignment (IA) and interference alignment and cancellation (IAC). PNC-SA adopts the seminal idea of 'demodulate a linear combination' from PNC. The design of PNC-SA is also inspired by recent advances in IA, though SA aligns signals not interferences. We study the optimal preceding and power allocation problem of PNC-SA, for SNR maximization at the receiver. The mapping from SNR to BER is then analyzed, revealing that the throughput gain of PNC-SA does not come with a sacrifice in BER. We finally demonstrate general applications of PNC-SA, and show via network level simulations that it can substantially increase the throughput of unicast and multicast sessions, by opening previously unexplored solution spaces in multi-hop MIMO routing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Network Coding with Signal Alignment for MIMO Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.142","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076651.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Network Coding with Signal Alignment for MIMO Wireless Networks","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076651/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360874","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Network Coding with Signal Alignment for MIMO Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118323S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6076652,"authors":[{"name":"Sabita Maharjan","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway","Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"firstName":"Sabita","lastName":"Maharjan","id":"37844966000"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway","Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"},{"name":"Chau Yuen","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chau","lastName":"Yuen","id":"37273147100"},{"name":"Stein Gjessing","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway","Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"firstName":"Stein","lastName":"Gjessing","id":"37267845900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076652","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Optimization","Media Access Protocol","Detectors","Probability distribution","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","game theory","radio spectrum management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed spectrum sensing","cognitive radio network","fairness consideration","cooperative spectrum sensing","medium access control protocol","MAC protocol","game theoretical framework","optimization problem","heterogeneous traffic dynamics","system utility","Nash equilibrium","fair social welfare correlated equilibrium","neighbourhood based learning algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076652","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.143","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","abstract":"Cooperative spectrum sensing improves the reliability of detection. However, if the secondary users are selfish, they may not collaborate for sensing. In order to address this problem, Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols can be designed to enforce cooperation among secondary users for spectrum sensing. In this paper, we investigate this problem using game theoretical framework. We introduce the concept of correlated equilibrium for the cooperative spectrum sensing game among non-cooperative secondary users and formulate the optimization problem for the case where secondary users have heterogeneous traffic dynamics. We show that the correlated equilibrium improves the system utility, as compared to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. While maximizing system payoff is important, fairness is also equally important in systems with dissimilar users. In order to address fairness issue, we propose a new fair social welfare correlated equilibrium, which maximizes the system utility and ensures that the less well-off users do not starve. We employ a no-regret learning algorithm for distributed implementation of the correlated equilibrium. Finally, we propose a neighbourhood based learning algorithm and show that it achieves better performance than the no-regret algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","startPage":"540","endPage":"549","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076652.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks with Fairness Consideration: Efficiency of Correlated Equilibrium","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076652/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks with Fairness Consideration: Efficiency of Correlated Equilibrium","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360875","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks with Fairness Consideration: Efficiency of Correlated Equilibrium","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119102S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6076653,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Dai","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Dai","id":"37856708200"},{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279156600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076653","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Routing","Channel estimation","Complexity theory","Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","communication complexity","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic source routing","cognitive radio networks","CRN","SINR-driven model","DSR","unicasting model","route reply message","RREP message","data transmission rate","source node","single route channel assignment","multiroute channel assignments","multiroute scheme","complexity analysis","multiroute channel assignment algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel assignment","cognitive radio networks","dynamic source routing","piggyback","SINR estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.58","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076653.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Channel Assignment under Dynamic Source Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"The channel assignment problem is one of the most important issues in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). Under a SINR-driven model, we consider channel assignments in a network using dynamic source routing (DSR). In this unicasting model, channel assignments are conducted in a relatively small scale of nodes, which are on the chosen route. In addition, we can make use of the route reply (RREP) message in DSR to estimate the SINR and the maximum data transmission rate of nodes on the chosen route. In this way, the source node can conduct the channel assignment in a more efficient way. We propose two algorithms for the single route and multi-route channel assignments, where the multi-route scheme uses alternative nodes to help transmitting. We give a complexity analysis of two algorithms and an extension of reducing complexity for the multi-route channel assignment algorithm. Finally, we conduct simulations of our two algorithms under networks with different densities and show that the performance of our algorithms is efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076653/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12360876","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076653/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Channel Assignment under Dynamic Source Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Channel Assignment under Dynamic Source Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065142S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6076656,"authors":[{"name":"Razvan Stanica","affiliation":["IRIT-ENSEEIHT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Razvan","lastName":"Stanica","id":"37545765200"},{"name":"Emmanuel Chaput","affiliation":["IRIT-ENSEEIHT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Chaput","id":"37353594000"},{"name":"Andre-Luc Beylot","affiliation":["IRIT-ENSEEIHT, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Andre-Luc","lastName":"Beylot","id":"37294719000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076656","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"abstract":"Enhancing road safety using vehicle-to-vehicle communication has become an important goal for the automotive industry.

The solutions proposed so far focus on data rate or transmission power control. In this paper, we argue that the most important parameter for congestion control in vehicular ad hoc networks is the carrier sense threshold. We support this theory with analytical and simulation results and we demonstrate that the optimal threshold depends on the vehicular density. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive mechanism for physical carrier sense control and analyse its performance, showing an important increase in message reception probability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Safety","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Receivers","Power control","Radio transmitters","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","power control","telecommunication congestion control","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VANET","vehicle-to-vehicle communication","automotive industry","medium access control protocol","MAC protocol","data rate","transmission power control","congestion control","vehicular ad hoc networks","carrier sense threshold","optimal threshold","vehicular density","message reception probability","physical carrier sense control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VANET","beaconing","CSMA","physical carrier sense"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.61","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076656.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Carrier Sense in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical Carrier Sense in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076656/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076656/","accessionNumber":"12360879","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Carrier Sense in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142175S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":6076674,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Dvir","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS), Budapest University of Technology & Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Dvir","id":"37284704500"},{"name":"T\u00b4mas Holczer","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS), Budapest University of Technology & Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"T\u00b4mas","lastName":"Holczer","id":"37403131200"},{"name":"Levente Buttyan","affiliation":["Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS), Budapest University of Technology & Economics, Hungary"],"firstName":"Levente","lastName":"Buttyan","id":"37324283900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1345-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4469-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-6806"}],"articleNumber":"6076674","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":927},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Measurement","Authentication","Logic gates","Routing protocols","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","directed graphs","internetworking","IP networks","message authentication","routing protocols","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VeRA","version number-rank authentication","IPv6 routing protocol","low-power-lossy networks","path diversity","gateway","network traffic","destination oriented directed acyclic graph","DODAG","routing topology","security service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LLN","RPL","Hash chain","Version Number","Rank","Authentication"]}],"abstract":"Designing a routing protocol for large low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), consisting of thousands of constrained nodes and unreliable links, presents new challenges. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL), have been developed by the IETF ROLL Working Group as a preferred routing protocol to provide IPv6 routing functionality in LLNs. RPL provides path diversity by building and maintaining directed acyclic graphs (DAG) rooted at one (or more) gateway. However, an adversary that impersonates a gateway or has compromised one of the nodes close to the gateway can divert a large part of network traffic forward itself and/or exhaust the nodes' batteries. Therefore in RPL, special security care must be taken when the Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root is updating the Version Number by which reconstruction of the routing topology can be initiated. The same care also must be taken to prevent an internal attacker (compromised DODAG node) to publish decreased Rank value, which causes a large part of the DODAG to connect to the DODAG root via the attacker and give it the ability to eavesdrop a large part of the network traffic forward itself. Unfortunately, the currently available security services in RPL will not protect against a compromised internal node that can construct and disseminate fake messages. In this paper, a new security service is described that prevents any misbehaving node from illegitimately increasing the Version Number and compromise illegitimate decreased Rank values.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2011.76","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075051/6076571/06076674.pdf","startPage":"709","endPage":"714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2011.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VeRA - Version Number and Rank Authentication in RPL","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076674/","displayDocTitle":"VeRA - Version Number and Rank Authentication in RPL","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360897","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076674/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VeRA - Version Number and Rank Authentication in RPL","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079534S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6076703,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

This scheme accommodates a channel model having velocity that accelerate and de-accelerate during a packet of multiple OFDM frames. Furthermore, it assumes that the Doppler-shift varies linearly during the symbol time. To deal with this variation, the time expansion/compression is measured within a fraction of the sample period and then compensated using sample-by-sample interpolation. The Doppler-shift and its residual are frequently estimated during the symbol time to mitigate the inter-carrier interference (ICI) by estimating the first order moment of the cyclic prefix correlation. Additionally, in this technique, the fractional deviation of the sub-carrier spacing, which is considered to be the source of ICI, is estimated by exploiting the fractional part of the normalized sampling frequency offset. The proposed algorithm performance is investigated with real data obtained from an experiment that took place in the North Sea in 2009. In addition, results show that the technique is robust and more pragmatic than existing cyclic prefix (CP)-based algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Eighth International Conference on

More specifically the available channels are not contiguous and vary from one location to another. In addition the white space available in a given location can vary with time if one or more of the TV band primary users start/stop operation. Public Safety Situation Aware services are a main concern when one strives to provide a standard overview of an incident. This standard overview aims at providing intervention information as refreshed as possible to facilitate Incident Commander/Unified Command (e.g. in the case of an European cooperative intervention that involves different Operations Center). Within this study, we propose to investigate how this service can be supported in a Cognitive Radio Network context by considering the unpredictable availability of spectrum resources. We present a Random Network Coding based technique and evaluate the performance assessment of this technique under Cognitive Radio Network assumptions. We show that even for a very restrictive radio resource access, Public Safety Situation Aware services can be fully supported without interfering with a existing primary user activity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360938","htmlLink":"/document/6076716/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Public Safety Situation Aware Services over Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Public Safety Situation Aware Services over Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4469a962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087198S","chronDate":"17-22 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075051","isNumber":"6076571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075051","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6076571","articleId":"6076716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076756,"authors":[{"name":"Yilei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538317100"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

However, invoking all the available cloud components from user-side for evaluation purpose is expensive and impractical. To address this critical challenge, we propose a neighborhood-based approach, called CloudPred, for collaborative and personalized quality prediction of cloud components. CloudPred is enhanced by feature modeling on both users and components. Our approach CloudPred requires no additional invocation of cloud components on behalf of the cloud application designers. The extensive experimental results show that CloudPred achieves higher QoS prediction accuracy than other competing methods. We also publicly release our large-scale QoS dataset for future related research in cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2011.10","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075220/6076749/06076756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2011.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076749","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Latent Features for Memory-Based QoS Prediction in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Latent Features for Memory-Based QoS Prediction in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076756/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360942","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Latent Features for Memory-Based QoS Prediction in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"4450a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099528S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075220","isNumber":"6076749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075220","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6076749","articleId":"6076756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6076757,"authors":[{"name":"Kamal Kc","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Kc","id":"37860592900"},{"name":"Xiaohui Gu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Gu","id":"37276603600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1349-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4450-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"},{"format":"CD","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"6076757","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":533},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Clustering algorithms","Cloud computing","Production systems","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","program debugging","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ELT","efficient log-based troubleshooting system","cloud computing infrastructures","hybrid log mining approach","fine-grained log features","coarse-grained log features","invariant checking","production cloud system","Hadoop cluster","software bugs","cloud system management practice"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076757","abstract":"We present an Efficient Log-based Troubleshooting(ELT) system for cloud computing infrastructures.

Users log into the computing infrastructure remotely, by providing their credentials (e.g., username and password), through the public network and using well-established authentication protocols, e.g., SSH. However, user credentials can be stolen and an attacker (using a stolen credential) can masquerade as the legitimate user and penetrate the system as an insider. This paper deals with security incidents initiated by using stolen credentials and occurred during the last three years at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. We analyze the key characteristics of the security data produced by the monitoring tools during the incidents and use a Bayesian network approach to correlate (i) data provided by different security tools (e.g., IDS and Net Flows) and (ii) information related to the users' profiles to identify compromised users, i.e., the users whose credentials have been stolen. The technique is validated with the real incident data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in detecting compromised users, while allows eliminating around 80% of false positives (i.e., not compromised user being declared compromised).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076770/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360956","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Compromised Users in Shared Computing Infrastructures: A Data-Driven Bayesian Network Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Compromised Users in Shared Computing Infrastructures: A Data-Driven Bayesian Network Approach","confLoc":"Madrid, Spain","sourcePdf":"4450a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126656S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6075220","isNumber":"6076749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6075220","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6076749","articleId":"6076770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6076811,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Sojka","affiliation":["System Department, IHP, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Sojka","id":"37860537200"},{"name":"Krzysztof Piotrowski","affiliation":["System Department, IHP, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Piotrowski","id":"37297117100"},{"name":"Peter Langendoerfer","affiliation":["System Department, IHP, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Langendoerfer","id":"37297116000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1624-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4451-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076811","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbiosis of a Lightweight ECC Security and Distributed Shared Memory Middleware in Wireless Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 30th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/6075221/6076449/06076811.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 30th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDSW.2011.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076449","doi":"10.1109/SRDSW.2011.14","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curves","Middleware","Elliptic curve cryptography","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware","public key cryptography","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight ECC security symbiosis","distributed shared memory middleware","wireless sensor networks","WSN","security management","short key cryptosystem","shared memory abstraction","tinyDSM","shortECC","AES","elliptic curve cryptography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","lightweight security","shared memory","group security management","public key infrastructure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076811","abstract":"In this paper we present our work on a combination of two approaches for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), to provide a self contained, reliable and secure shared memory middleware with security management.

In the (primary) domain of beamformer weights, the proposed algorithm operates the projections onto multiple closed convex sets each of which bounds the magnitude of an instantaneous beamformer-output. At the same time, it also operates the projection onto a closed ball in a secondary domain. All the projections are combined convexly in the primary domain. The idea of the secondary-domain projection is to bound the energy of interfering signals remaining in the beamformer output. The numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm achieves drastic improvements of the convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12360982","htmlLink":"/document/6076841/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming by simultaneous projection in dual domains","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming by simultaneous projection in dual domains","confLoc":"Poitiers, France","sourcePdf":"NDS11MO23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071807S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6064925","isNumber":"6076826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6064925","xplore-issue":"6076826","articleId":"6076841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076845,"authors":[{"name":"Zangen Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zangen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38241104900"},{"name":"Ran Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403649100"},{"name":"Jingxin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems and Electrical Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Jingxin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293675600"},{"name":"Cishen Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Industrial Sciences, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Cishen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274220300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-817-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-815-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-816-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076845","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"abstract":"How to speed up the scanning process is the bottleneck problem of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As a newly developed mathematical framework of signal sampling and recovery, compressed sensing (CS) provides a solution to this problem because of its potential of reconstructing MR images from fewer samples. Recent work has demonstrated successful application of CS to MRI. However, the frequently used sparsifying transform is the traditional discrete wavelet transform, which has shortcomings, such as oscillations, lack of directionality and shift variance. This paper implements compressed sensing MRI reconstruction based on a new kind of two-dimensional wavelet filter banks which has improved directional selectivity and approximate shift invariance. Our experiments show that the method can significantly reduce aliasing and achieve higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 International Workshop on Multidimensional (nD) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6064925/6076826/06076845.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"The 2011 International Workshop on Multidimensional (nD) Systems","doi":"10.1109/nDS.2011.6076845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/nDS.2011.6076845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI by two-dimensional wavelet filter banks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Phantoms","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","discrete wavelet transforms","filtering theory","mathematical analysis","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two dimensional wavelet filter banks","magnetic resonance imaging","mathematical framework","signal sampling","signal recovery","CS","compressed sensing MRI","discrete wavelet transform","peak signal to noise ratio","PSNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing MRI by two-dimensional wavelet filter banks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360986","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing MRI by two-dimensional wavelet filter banks","confLoc":"Poitiers, France","sourcePdf":"NDS11MO32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050897S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6064925","isNumber":"6076826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6064925","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6076826","articleId":"6076845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6076921,"authors":[{"name":"Amitangshu Pal","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Amitangshu","lastName":"Pal","id":"37393613200"},{"name":"Asis Nasipuri","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Asis","lastName":"Nasipuri","id":"37297865800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1265-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1264-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1263-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-0375"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-0367"},{"format":"CD","value":"1944-0367"}],"articleNumber":"6076921","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"abstract":"We present an analytical model to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) with and without the RTS/CTS handshake in radio-over-fiber (RoF) wireless LANs.

Radio jamming, the most common type of localized disruption causes wireless link failures. Jamming mitigation has been traditionally addressed in the physical and MAC layers. Such approaches come with added complexity and often require specialized hardware. We investigate whether a generally applicable routing layer approach, based on multipath routing coupled with power control, can mitigate the effects of jamming. We propose (1) proactive protection and (2) reactive protection techniques for jamming mitigation in wireless multihop networks with fixed nodes. For reactive protection, we propose a distributed geographic routing algorithm that finds alternative route to the destination, starting from the first node with failed link on the original path. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm using OPNET simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076932/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12361227","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076932/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A routing approach to jamming mitigation in wireless multihop networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A routing approach to jamming mitigation in wireless multihop networks","confLoc":"Chapel Hill, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"21patelrouting.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059744S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6068505","isNumber":"6076913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6068505","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6076913","articleId":"6076932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6076962,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Der Chou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Der","lastName":"Chou","id":"37301808400"},{"name":"Yao-Tsung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Tsung","lastName":"Yang","id":"38090201100"},{"name":"Wen-Pei Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Pei","lastName":"Chang","id":"38237038500"},{"name":"Yi-Shou Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Shou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37965970200"},{"name":"Te-Chin Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Te-Chin","lastName":"Chang","id":"38239511400"},{"name":"Ce-Kuen Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ce-Kuen","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37265551300"},{"name":"Sheng-Wei Huang","affiliation":["National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, TW"],"firstName":"Sheng-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"38106109300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076962","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Graphical user interfaces","Software","Monitoring","Measurement","Servers","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","field programmable gate arrays","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NetFPGA","network virtualization","physical network managements","hierarchical management system of virtual network","network flows"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hierarchical management","network virtualization","virtual network management","NetFPGA"]}],"abstract":"With the advancement of network virtualization, physical and virtual network managements become more and more complex and difficult.

We have considered two M2M communication platforms namely smart-devices and sensor network in our system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076967","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06076967.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A policy based management framework for machine to machine networks and services","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A policy based management framework for machine to machine networks and services","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6076967/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377204","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A policy based management framework for machine to machine networks and services","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S1886843.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063158S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6076967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6076973,"authors":[{"name":"Ge-Lian Chao","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Laboratory, Chunghwa Telecom Laboratories, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ge-Lian","lastName":"Chao","id":"38231776600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076973","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","MIMO","Vectors","Transmitters","Computational complexity","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","fading channels","feedback","MIMO communication","precoding","quantisation (signal)","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel monitoring scheme","multiple-antenna wireless communication","flat-fading wireless system","limited feedback multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems","scalar quantization","codebook","uniform bit assignment","optimal bit assignment","exhaustive search method","MIMO equal gain precoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","scalar quantization (SQ)","equal gain precoder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076973","abstract":"We consider the design of the channel monitoring scheme in flat-fading and limited feedback multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems.

In such precoders, bit assignment can be used for quantization to further improve the system performance. There are two conventional bit assignment schemes. One is the uniform bit assignment and the other is the optimal bit assignment obtained by using exhaustive search. The uniform bit assignment is simple but turns out to have obvious performance degradation. On the other hand, the exhaustive search method leads to the optimal performance. However, its computational complexity is extremely high and may be somewhat impractical to be realized. In this paper, we propose two bit assignment methods for the MIMO equal gain precoder with scalar quantization. The proposed methods are with low complexity and their performance are close to that of the optimal scheme. Consequently, the proposed bit assignments provide good trade-off between performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076973","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06076973.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel monitoring scheme in multiple-antenna wireless communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A channel monitoring scheme in multiple-antenna wireless communications","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076973/","accessionNumber":"12377210","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076973/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel monitoring scheme in multiple-antenna wireless communications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S21486722.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056905S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6076973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6076989,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Hsin Lee","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Hsin","lastName":"Lee","id":"38240395000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6076989","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Throughput","Bandwidth","Quality of service","Signal to noise ratio","Loading","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load balance","3GPP femtocell network","user equipment","call probability","data rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load Balance","LTE","HeNB","Femto-Cell"]}],"abstract":"The number of femto-cell users will increase dramatically in the future, but the unbalanced load distribution in femto-cell environment is unavoidable because users would move around.

Although virtualization improves the usage of hardware devices and flexibility, it brings new security challenges. Users face a new type of attacks, called inter-VM attack, which targets at the VMs running on the same physical machine. To eliminate the possible inter-VM attacks from competitors, we propose a centralized control mechanism based on the Chinese Wall security policy to forbid deploying and running the competitors' VMs on the same physical machines so that physical isolation is achieved. We build the Chinese Wall Central Management System (CWCMS) with the proposed centralized control mechanism in an internal-built experimental cloud. CWCMS effectively manages the VMs and enforce the Chinese Wall security policy in the cloud. Furthermore, CWCMS employs the graph coloring algorithm to achieve the better utilization of cloud resources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06076992.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6076992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6076992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical Chinese wall security model in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Security","Virtual machine monitors","Hardware","Centralized control","Servers","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","graph colouring","security of data","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["practical Chinese wall security model","cloud computing","virtualization technology","on demand scalability","interVM attacks","centralized control mechanism","graph coloring algorithm","cloud resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese Wall security policy","Virtualization","Cloud"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6076992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A practical Chinese wall security model in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6076992/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377228","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical Chinese wall security model in cloud computing","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"S3186530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103309S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6076992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6077005,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hsu-Su","affiliation":["Chunghwa Telecommunication Laboratory, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hsu-Su","id":"38318246400"},{"name":"Bo-Teng Deng","affiliation":["Chunghwa Telecommunication Laboratory, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bo-Teng","lastName":"Deng","id":"38329760000"},{"name":"Chia-Hong Lin","affiliation":["Chunghwa Telecommunication Laboratory, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hong","lastName":"Lin","id":"38337424900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6077005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Servers","Computer architecture","Collaboration","Global Positioning System","Databases","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed collaboration scheme","service management","region detection","location based service detection","commercial vehicle operations system","LBS detection","mobile service operator","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location Based Services(LBS)","LBS Architecture","Service Management","Trial Results","Case Studies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077005","abstract":"In recent years, the Location Based Services (LBS) have grown rapidly.

In this paper, a distributed collaboration scheme of region detection is proposed to solve the problem and implemented in a commercial vehicle operations system. The effect of the scheme can be verified by analyzing the service data and simulation results. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has a great improvement in decreasing system processing time and the quantity of data transmission, which will achieve remarkable success in raising the system efficiency and quality of services.

While configuring the firewalls, rule configuration has to conform to, or say be consistent with, the demands of the network security policies so that the network security would not be flawed. Accordingly, firewall rule editing, ordering, and distribution must be done very carefully on each of the cooperative firewalls, especially in a large-scale and multi-firewall-equipped network. Nevertheless, network operators are prone to incorrectly configuring the firewalls because there are typically thousands or hundreds of thousands of filtering/admission rules (i.e., rules in the Access Control List file; or ACL for short) which could be setup in a firewall, not mention these rules among firewalls which affect mutually can make the matter worse. Under this situation, the network operators would hardly know their mis-configuration until the network functions beyond the expectations. For this, our work is to build a feasible diagnosis system for checking the anomalies between firewalls' rules which often give rise to the inconsistency between the demands of network security policies and firewall rule configuration. The system collects the filtering/admission rules (or ACL rules) from all of the firewalls (and routers if they are ACL-configured) in the managed network and then a Rule Anomaly Relation tree (RAR tree) is created on the basis of these collected firewall rules. By utilizing the RAR tree, we can not only do the diagnosis of intra-ACL rule anomalies more efficiently, but make the diagnosis of inter-ACL rule anomalies much easier and more flexible. In addition, to facilitate the understanding of the diagnosis results, a systematic visualization approach is also developed. With the aid of this approach, the anomaly situation can be easily revealed and investigated. As a consequence, our prototype system with discussions is shown at the end of this paper as a demonstration our system's performance and, as of now, part of our system design and implementation has been applied to our campus network also.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management

that, although these traffic features are unstable and show seasonal patterns like traffic volume for a long period, they are stable and consistent with Gaussian distribution in a short time period. However, this equilibrium property will be violated by some anomalies. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-dimensional Clustering method for Short-time scale Traffic(MCST) to classify abnormal and normal traffic. We compare our new method to the well known wavelet technique. The detection result on synthetic anomaly traffic shows MCST can better detect the low-rate attacks than wavelet-based method, and detection result on real traffic demonstrates that MCST can detect more anomalies with low false alarm rate.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077018","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06077018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MCST: Anomaly detection using feature stability for packet-level traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077018","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MCST: Anomaly detection using feature stability for packet-level traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077018/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377253","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6077018/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCST: Anomaly detection using feature stability for packet-level traffic","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TS3385408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081815S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6077018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6077024,"authors":[{"name":"Taku Kihara","affiliation":["NTT Network Service Systems Laboratories, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Taku","lastName":"Kihara","id":"37661861500"},{"name":"Naoki Tateishi","affiliation":["NTT Network Service Systems Laboratories, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Tateishi","id":"37973259800"},{"name":"Saburo Seto","affiliation":["NTT Network Service Systems Laboratories, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Saburo","lastName":"Seto","id":"37975663200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6077024","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Vectors","IP networks","Fault detection","Data models","Network interfaces","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network performance evaluation","computer network reliability","computer network security","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fault location","IP networks","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network fault detection method","matrix eigenvector","IP network reliability","network monitoring alarms","anomaly detection method","network fault simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP Network","Fault Detection","Multi-Variant Analysis","Matrix Eigenvector"]}],"abstract":"To provide high-quality and highly reliable services in IP networks, the service down time after network faults have occurred needs to be reduced. However, there are network faults that operators cannot detect with network monitoring alarms, such as Simple Network Management Protocol Trap, or by monitoring device statuses from collected network data. To solve this problem, we focused on anomaly-detection methods. Although these methods have been proposed for computer systems, few studies have focused on IP networks. Therefore, we focused an anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector for detecting faults in IP networks and evaluated whether this method can be applied to IP networks by using network fault simulations. Evaluation results show that the anomaly-detection method based on a matrix eigenvector is effective in detecting network faults in IP networks, but it has two problems. One is that this method may detect normal states as anomalies and the other is that optimizing the discounting factor for detecting sequential faults is difficult.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of network fault-detection method based on anomaly detection with matrix eigenvector","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077024","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06077024.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077024","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of network fault-detection method based on anomaly detection with matrix eigenvector","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6077024/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377259","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of network fault-detection method based on anomaly detection with matrix eigenvector","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TS5186696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044535S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6077024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6077031,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Te Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taoyuan, Taiwan","Information & Communication Security Laboratory TL, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Yangmei, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Te","lastName":"Liu","id":"37599346400"},{"name":"Shiou-Jing Lin","affiliation":["Information & Communication Security Laboratory TL, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Yangmei, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shiou-Jing","lastName":"Lin","id":"38238109900"},{"name":"Yi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600575000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6077031","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Continuous wavelet transforms","Time series analysis","Time frequency analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","file servers","information systems","pattern clustering","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["density based clustering","wavelet methods","information systems","online internal systems","network I/O","network anomaly detection","data collection","file servers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet transform","system anomaly","anomaly detection"]}],"abstract":"Internal information systems play an important role in keeping the enterprises running well. To detect system anomalies, previous research achieved good results with system symptoms; however, the presented results are primarily performed on a relatively small scale and within a short time period. To understand the system's long-term profiles, we collected four common symptom data including CPU usage, memory loading, disk I/O, and network I/O from more than 100 online internal systems that includes 300 servers for 9 months. We randomly selected 50 servers from these servers and analyze their data in order to understand each symptom's long-term features. Based on our findings in network I/O, we propose a new approach combining a density-based clustering and wavelet methods to detect system anomalies. We also select 44 other servers to evaluate the false positive rate and simulate three types of system anomalies to evaluate the detection rate. The experiment results show that our approach has a great improvement on both the false positive rate and the detection rate compared to another wavelet-based network anomaly detection approach.","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077031","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06077031.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining density-based clustering and wavelet methods for internal systems anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077031","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combining density-based clustering and wavelet methods for internal systems anomaly detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077031/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377266","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6077031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining density-based clustering and wavelet methods for internal systems anomaly detection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TS6386715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089126S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6077031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6077039,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Jiang","affiliation":["Network Research Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38230931200"},{"name":"Changqing An","affiliation":["Network Research Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changqing","lastName":"An","id":"37286422000"},{"name":"Jiahai Yang","affiliation":["Network Research Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiahai","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292630300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1670-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1668-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1669-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6077039","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Filtering algorithms","IP networks","Heuristic algorithms","Prototypes","Measurement","Computer crime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","educational institutions","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive operation parameters tuning","automatically learned filter table","network security mechanisms","packet validation","IP address","access networks","IP spoofing","TCAM","source address validation improvement","dynamic adjustment method","campus network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Management","Configuration Management","SAVI","Filter Table","IPv6"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077039","doi":"10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APNOMS.2011.6077039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6076947","publicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 13th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069626/6076947/06077039.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive tuning of operation parameters for automatically learned filter table","abstract":"Automatically learned filter table is used in many network security mechanisms to validate packets. Building filter item for each IP address in access networks can prevent IP spoofing at fine granularity but may consume large amount of filter table which is limited due to the expensive storage which is usually TCAM for high speed access. It is an urgent problem to use filter table effectively and keep network available. We analyze the change of filter table size and find that setting proper lifetime for filter item can significantly improve the utilization of filter table and avoid denial of service. In this paper, we take SAVI (source address validation improvement) switch as an example, and propose a dynamic adjustment method. It has two phases. Firstly it calculates out an optimal lifetime value for each switch based on one week user online logs, and then adjusts it dynamically to capture the bursts of filter table size. We deploy our prototype in a real campus network which has about 1000 SAVI switches providing network accessing service for nearly 20000 users. Based on the analysis of one month user online logs, we verify that our algorithm can reduce 92% of the duplicate confirming processes and guarantee the availability of network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6077039/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377274","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive tuning of operation parameters for automatically learned filter table","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive tuning of operation parameters for automatically learned filter table","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TS8286685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076245S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069626","isNumber":"6076947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069626","xplore-issue":"6076947","articleId":"6077039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6077061,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The information security concept becomes a more complicated subject when the more sophisticated system requirements and real time computation speed are considered. In order to solve these issues, lots of research and development activities are carried out and cryptography has been a very important part of any communication system in the recent years. Cryptographic algorithms fulfil specific information security requirements such as data integrity, confidentiality and authenticity. This work proposes an FPGA-based VLSI Crypto-System, integrating hardware that accelerates the cryptographic algorithms used in the SSL/TLS protocol. SSL v3 and TLS v1 protocol is deployed in the proposed system powered with a Nios-2 soft-core processor. The cipher functions used in SSL-driven connection are the Scalable Encryption Algorithm (SEA), Message Digest Algorithm (MD5), Secured Hash Algorithm (SHA2). These algorithms are accelerated in the VLSI Crypto-System that is on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA DE2 development board. The experimental results shows that, by hardware acceleration of SEA, MD5 and SHA2 cryptographic algorithms, the VLSI Crypto-System performance has increased in terms of speed, optimized area and enhanced level security for the target Cybernetic application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach towards improved cyber security by hardware acceleration of OpenSSL cryptographic functions","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Computing Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2011.6077061","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Computing Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069666/6077050/06077061.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2011.6077061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077050","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An approach towards improved cyber security by hardware acceleration of OpenSSL cryptographic functions","conferenceDate":"12-13 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6077061/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach towards improved cyber security by hardware acceleration of OpenSSL cryptographic functions","confLoc":"Villupuram, India","sourcePdf":"AnApproachtowardsImprovedCyberSecuritybyHardw.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088096S","chronDate":"12-13 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069666","isNumber":"6077050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069666","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6077050","articleId":"6077061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6077070,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38231420600"},{"name":"V K Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"V K","lastName":"Jain","id":"37290871500"},{"name":"Subrat Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Subrat","lastName":"Kar","id":"37368588800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1894-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1895-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1893-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6077070","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":588},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the performance of FSO system using OOK and M-PPM modulation schemes in inter-satellite links with turbo codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Satellites","Modulation","Bit error rate","Earth","Signal to noise ratio","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","block codes","error statistics","optical modulation","pulse position modulation","satellite links","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FSO communication system","OOK modulation","M-PPM modulation schemes","inter-satellite links","turbo codes","free space optical communication","laser technology","message signal modulation","input block code","error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OOK","M-PPM","turbo code","bit error rate","signal to noise ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077070","abstract":"This paper gives a detailed overview of the inter-satellite links used in free space optical (FSO) communication.

CSFD scheme is proposed in which the results of a homogeneity test are used to identify the faulty nodes within the network such that their quantized messages can be filtered out when estimating the parameter of interest. The scheme can identify the faulty nodes efficiently and improve the performance of the decision fusion significantly. It achieves very good performance at the expense of such extensive computations as exponent and multiplication/division in the detecting process. In many real-time WSN applications, the fusion center might be implemented in an ASIC and included in a stand-alone device. Therefore, a simple and efficient decision fusion scheme requiring lower hardware cost and power consumption is extremely desired. In this paper, we propose the Approximated Collaborative Sensor Fault Detection (ACSFD) scheme and its VLSI architecture. Sorting operation are required in ACSFD to find out four biggest faulty node indexes for subsequent usage for this purpose. we have implemented different sorting algorithm to evaluate the efficiency of the sorting network.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2011.6077081","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Computing Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Electronics, Communication and Computing Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069666/6077050/06077081.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2011.6077081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of sorting network for ACSFD in WSN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of sorting network for ACSFD in WSN","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6077081/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360533","conferenceDate":"12-13 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of sorting network for ACSFD in WSN","confLoc":"Villupuram, India","sourcePdf":"VLSIImplementationofSortingNetworkforACSFDinW.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111831S","chronDate":"12-13 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069666","isNumber":"6077050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069666","xplore-issue":"6077050","articleId":"6077081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6077317,"authors":[{"name":"Jianning Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Tribology, Department of Precision Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Jianning","lastName":"Ding"},{"name":"Yonggang Meng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Tribology, Department of Precision Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Yonggang","lastName":"Meng"},{"name":"Shizhu Wen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Tribology, Department of Precision Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Shizhu","lastName":"Wen"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6077317","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7583},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077317","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Young's modulus","Micromechanical devices","Films","Accuracy","Silicon","Strain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Young modulus","microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)","polysilicon"]}],"abstract":"The elastic modulus is a very important mechanical property in micromachined structures. Several design issues such as resonant frequencies and stiffness in the micromachined structures are related to the elastic modulus. In addition, the accuracy of results from finite element models is highly dependent upon the elastic modulus. In this study, the Young modulus of micromachined thin polysilicon films has been investigated with a new tensile test machine using a magnetic-solenoid force actuator with linear response, low hysteresis, no friction and direct electrical control. The tensile test results show that the measured average value of Young modulus for a typical sample, (164 \u00b1 1. 2) GPa, falls within the theoretical bounds of the texture model.

Because the theory is based on the assumption of that the location of sparse values is unknown, it has many constraints in practical applications. In fact, in many cases such as image processing, the location of sparse values is knowable, and CS can degrade to a linear process. In order to take full advantage of the visual information of images, this paper proposes the concept of dimensionality reduction transform matrix and then selects sparse values by constructing an accuracy control matrix, so on this basis, a degradation algorithm is designed that the signal can be obtained by the measurements as many as sparse values and reconstructed through a linear process. In comparison with similar methods, the degradation algorithm is effective in reducing the number of sensors and improving operational efficiency. The algorithm is also used to achieve the CS process with the same amount of data as joint photographic exports group (JPEG) compression and acquires the same display effect.","doi":"10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2011.05.016","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971804/6077650/06077668.pdf","startPage":"832","endPage":"839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.3969/j.issn.1004-4132.2011.05.016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation algorithm of compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077668/","displayDocTitle":"Degradation algorithm of compressive sensing","volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Degradation algorithm of compressive sensing","sourcePdf":"832839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039903S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6077650","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6077668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6077669,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiyao Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing 100044, P.

Since the generator matrices are dense, and if the positions of \u201c1\u201d s are irregularity, the encoder needs to store every \u201c1\u201d of the generator matrices by using huge chip area. In order to solve this problem, we need to design the protograph LDPC codes with circular generator matrices. A theorem concerning the circulating property of generator matrices of nonsingular protograph LDPC codes is proposed. The circulating property of generator matrix of nonsingular protograph LDPC codes can be obtained from the corresponding quasi-cyclic parity check matrix. This paper gives a scheme of constructing protograph LDPC codes with circulating generator matrices, and it reveals that the fast encoding algorithm of protograph LDPC codes has lower encoding complexity under the condition of the proposed theorem.

An information theory-based criterion was also developed to evaluate the potential classification power of different features. Comparative experiments show that even with a relatively simple feature descriptor, the proposed HOG feature achieves almost the same recognition rate with much lower computational time than the widely used Gabor feature on the FRGC and CAS-PEAL databases.","doi":"10.1016/S1007-0214(11)70032-3","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5971803/6077972/06077989.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6077972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S1007-0214(11)70032-3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histogram of the oriented gradient for face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6077989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Histogram of the oriented gradient for face recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6077989/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2011","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Histogram of the oriented gradient for face recognition","sourcePdf":"216224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018003S","chronDate":"April  2011","isNumber":"6077972","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"27","articleId":"6077989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6077997,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Yingning Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Yingning","lastName":"Peng"},{"name":"Chunmao Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Chunmao","lastName":"Yeh"},{"name":"Jun Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1007-0214"}],"articleNumber":"6077997","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Tsinghua University Press (TUP)","url":"#"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Radar imaging","Convolution","Parallel processing","Imaging","Graphics processing unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolution back projection (CBP)","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","general purpose graphic processing units (GPGPU)"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a parallel fast convolution back-projection algorithm design for radar image reconstruction.

A closed-form power scheduling policy is given for a homogeneous environment, which shows that more than 50% of the power should be allocated to sensor observation transmissions. For an inhomogeneous environment, a multilevel waterfilling type solution is developed for the power scheduling among sensors for only the sum power constraint with a \u201ccave\u201d waterfilling solution for both the sum and individual power constraints.

The CRs utilize selection combining of the decision statistics obtained by an improved energy detector for making a binary decision of the presence or absence of a primary user (PU). The improved energy detector uses an arbitrary positive power p of amplitudes of samples of the PU's signals. The decision of each CR is orthogonally forwarded over imperfect reporting channels to a fusion center, which takes the final decision of a spectrum hole. We derive expressions of the probabilities of false alarm and missed detection of the proposed cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. By minimizing the total error rate (sum of the probability of missed detection and the probability of false alarm) we derive a closed-form solution of the optimal number of CRs required for cooperation. It is shown by simulations that by using multiple antennas at the CRs, it is possible to significantly improve reliability of spectrum sensing with extremely low interference levels to the PU at very low (much less than 0 dB) signal-to-noise ratio of the PU-CR link.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6132225/06078378.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.103111.111884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.103111.111884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6132225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Multiple Antenna Based Cognitive Radio Network Using an Improved Energy Detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Error analysis","Detectors","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","decision theory","diversity reception","probability","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing scheme","multiple antenna","cognitive radio network","improved energy detector","selection combining","binary decision statistics","primary user signal detection","fusion center","imperfect reporting channels","spectrum hole","false alarm probability","probability of missed detection","spectrum sensing reliability","low interference levels","signal-to-noise ratio","PU-CR link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative spectrum sensing","improved energy detector","multiple antennas","total error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Multiple Antenna Based Cognitive Radio Network Using an Improved Energy Detector","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6078378/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12477990","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Multiple Antenna Based Cognitive Radio Network Using an Improved Energy Detector","sourcePdf":"064-cl1201-singh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049522S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6132225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6132225","articleId":"6078378","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6078380,"authors":[{"name":"Magnus Sandell","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Sandell","id":"37269836200"},{"name":"Henning Vetter","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Vetter","id":"37640976900"},{"name":"Filippo Tosato","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Tosato","id":"37271877800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6078380","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1054},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","MIMO","Bit error rate","Multiplexing","Signal to noise ratio","Perturbation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","nonlinear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint linear-nonlinear precoding","MIMO systems","multiuser MIMO vector perturbation precoding","transmit symbols","transmit power","modulo operation","LTE","resource allocation","power normalisation","modified sphere encoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear precoding","vector perturbation","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Multiuser MIMO vector perturbation precoding facilitates multiple representations of the transmit symbols in order to improve transmit power normalisation of the transmitted signal. All the receiver needs to do is to apply a modulo operation to undo the perturbation. However existing system with multiuser MIMO support, such as LTE, employ linear precoding. This means that these legacy users will not be able to operate together with new users with vector perturbation capabilities, reducing the system throughput and flexibility in resource allocation. In this paper we present a novel precoding technique which allows the joint precoding of legacy and new users. The precoding ensures that no perturbations are made to linearly precoded users, while minimising the power normalisation using a modified sphere encoder. We also show that the diversity order of the joint precoding scheme is the difference between the number of transmit antennas and the number of legacy users, regardless of the number of new users.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2011.103111.110542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/6104419/06078380.pdf","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2011.103111.110542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Linear and Nonlinear Precoding in MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078380/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Linear and Nonlinear Precoding in MIMO Systems","volume":"15","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425112","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078380/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Linear and Nonlinear Precoding in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"1265-cl1112-sandell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03567S","chronDate":"December  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6104419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6104419","articleId":"6078380","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6078393,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Pal","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Pal","id":"38231163000"},{"name":"Aneesh Nainani","affiliation":["Applied Materials, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aneesh","lastName":"Nainani","id":"37393232600"},{"name":"Suyog Gupta","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Suyog","lastName":"Gupta","id":"38239359200"},{"name":"Krishna C.

The most relevant features within the observed results are the presence of dihedral-like scattering in the ground layer, which is hardly noticeable in the original single-look complex data, and the substantial invariance of the innermost forest layer to topographic slopes.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2011.2170658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2011.2170658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163264","startPage":"442","endPage":"446","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/6163264/06078396.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078396","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Scattering","Remote sensing","Surface topography","Image resolution","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","radar polarimetry","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","tomography","vegetation","vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P-band scattering","tropical forest","three-dimensional SAR tomography","tomographic analysis","P-band synthetic aperture radar multibaseline data set","ONERA","French Guyana","European Space Agency","TropiSAR campaign","scene complex reflectivity","coherent focusing","ground layer dihedral-like scattering","innermost forest layer invariance","topographic slope","radar polarimetry","size 20 m to 40 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forests","polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","tomorgraphy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Phenomenology of P-Band Scattering From a Tropical Forest Through Three-Dimensional SAR Tomography","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12575030","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6078396/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078396/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phenomenology of P-Band Scattering From a Tropical Forest Through Three-Dimensional SAR Tomography","sourcePdf":"lgrs-mariottidalessandro-2170658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054482S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6163264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6163264","articleId":"6078396","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6078398,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Wang","affiliation":["NICTA-Victoria Research Laboratory, Department of Electric and Electrical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wang","id":"37653875500"},{"name":"Ampalavanapillai Nirmalathas","affiliation":["The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Ampalavanapillai","lastName":"Nirmalathas","id":"37270057800"},{"name":"Christina Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Lim","id":"37279826900"},{"name":"Efstratios Skafidas","affiliation":["The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Efstratios","lastName":"Skafidas","id":"37370047000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6078398","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1307},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical transmitters","Wireless communication","Adaptive optics","Optical fiber networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","indoor communication","optical fibre communication","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full duplex indoor optical wireless communication system","down link","up link","simultaneous error free","crosstalk","error free operation","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","bit rate 500 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber-optics links and subsystems","full-duplex wireless communication","indoor optical wireless communications"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a high-speed full-duplex indoor optical wireless communication system for both down-link and up-link is experimentally demonstrated.

Therefore, the hopping rate can be set independently using a clock that is asynchronous to the internal switching frequencies of the converter, and no synchronization between the switching frequencies themselves or between them and the hopping clock is necessary. Moreover, the proposed continuous ramp signal minimizes transients associated with hopping, hence maximizing the hopping rate and spur reduction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","volume":"58","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"12376768","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078407/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Buck Converter With Reduced Output Spurs Using Asynchronous Frequency Hopping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Buck Converter With Reduced Output Spurs Using Asynchronous Frequency Hopping","sourcePdf":"tcsii-fayed-2164959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050896S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"6083463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6083463","articleId":"6078407","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6078409,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Bi","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A STAR, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Bi","id":"38184946500"},{"name":"Yongxin Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882000"},{"name":"James Brinkhoff","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Brinkhoff","id":"37274773800"},{"name":"Lin Jia","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Jia","id":"38001340400"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37859114000"},{"name":"Yong Zhong Xiong","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Zhong","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37404017900"},{"name":"Mook Seng Leong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mook Seng","lastName":"Leong","id":"37280690400"},{"name":"Fujiang Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fujiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37288118800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6078409","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1205},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","Power amplifiers","Switching circuits","Impedance matching","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","millimetre wave power amplifiers","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supply band-tunable power amplifier","CMOS power amplifier","high-Q transformer matching","deep-neutralized differential pairs","frequency 60 GHz","voltage 1 V","size 65 nm","frequency 7 GHz","current 63 mA","gain 17.1 dB","frequency 59 GHz","gain 16.2 dB","frequency 53.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band tunable","millimeter-wave integrated circuits","neutralization","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078409","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2011.2168010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2011.2168010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6083463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/6083463/06078409.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-GHz 1-V Supply Band-Tunable Power Amplifier in 65-nm CMOS","abstract":"This brief presents the design of a band-tunable 60-GHz CMOS power amplifier using 65-nm standard CMOS technology.

The computed waveform of radial current (including both conduction and displacement currents) agrees well with the corresponding measured waveform.

Additionally, the increase of coupling between the energized wire and another one nearby due to corona discharge is well reproduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6214970/06078414.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2011.2172688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2011.2172688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6214970","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified Model of Corona Discharge on Overhead Wire for FDTD Computations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Corona","Discharges","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Conductivity","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corona","finite difference time-domain analysis","power overhead lines","solar corona","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corona discharge simplified model","overhead wire","FDTD computations","surge computation propagation","finite-difference time-domain method","radial progression","corona streamers","cylindrical conducting region","Noda simulation","corona initiation","critical background electric field","streamer propagation","radial current computed waveform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Corona discharge","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","lightning","surge"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Model of Corona Discharge on Overhead Wire for FDTD Computations","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6078414/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12785408","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified Model of Corona Discharge on Overhead Wire for FDTD Computations","sourcePdf":"temc-baba-2172688-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055041S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6214970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6214970","articleId":"6078414","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6078416,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Gonzalez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture and Automatics, Computer Science Faculty, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6133465/6078416/6078416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering from the Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Architecture and Automation of the Universidad Complutense Madrid.

The data are usually collected by a satellite or an airborne instrument and sent to a ground station that processes it. The main bottleneck of this approach is the (often reduced) bandwidth connection between the satellite and the station, which drastically limits the information that can be sent and processed in real time. A possible way to overcome this problem is to include onboard computing resources able to preprocess the data, reducing its size by orders of magnitude. Reconfigurable field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a promising platform that allows hardware/software codesign and the potential to provide powerful onboard computing capability and flexibility at the same time. Since FPGAs can implement custom hardware solutions, they can reach very high performance levels. Moreover, using run-time reconfiguration, the functionality of the FPGA can be updated at run time as many times as needed to perform different computations. Hence, the FPGA can be reused for several applications reducing the number of computing resources needed. One of the most popular and widely used techniques for analyzing hyperspectral data is linear spectral unmixing, which relies on the identification of pure spectral signatures via a so-called endmember extraction algorithm. In this paper, we present the first FPGA design for N-FINDR, a widely used endmember extraction algorithm in the literature. Our system includes a direct memory access module and implements a prefetching technique to hide the latency of the input/output communications. The proposed method has been implemented on a Virtex-4 XC4VFX60 FPGA (a model that is similar to radiation-hardened FPGAs certified for space operation) and tested using real hyperspectral data collected by NASA's Earth Observing-1 Hyperion (a satellite instrument) and the Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer over the Cuprite mining district in Nevada and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in California. Experimental results demonstrate that our hardware version of the N-FINDR algorithm can significantly outperform an equivalent software version and is able to provide accurate results in near real time, which makes our reconfigurable system appealing for onboard hyperspectral data processing.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6133465/06078416.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2171693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of the N-FINDR Algorithm for Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Image Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078416/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of the N-FINDR Algorithm for Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Image Analysis","volume":"50","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078416/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12477859","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of the N-FINDR Algorithm for Remotely Sensed Hyperspectral Image Analysis","sourcePdf":"tgrs-plaza-2171693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077645S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6133465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6133465","articleId":"6078416","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6078417,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Chiba","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6132606/6078417/6078417-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Akira Chiba (S'82\u2013M'88\u2013SM'97\u2013F'07) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1960.

This is mainly due to the complexity of a detailed electrical machine model which makes it computationally expensive.

Photoplethysmograms were measured through clothing using seat mounted sensors with specially designed amplifier circuits that vary in light intensity according to clothing type. Ballistocardiograms were recorded using a film type transducer material, polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF), which was installed beneath the seat cover. By simultaneously measuring signals, beat-to-beat heart rates could be monitored even when electrocardiograms were not recorded due to movement artifacts. Beat-to-beat blood pressure was also monitored using unconstrained measurements of pulse arrival time and other physiological parameters, and our experimental results indicated that the estimated blood pressure tended to coincide with actual blood pressure measurements.

The system consists of front-end chopper amplifiers and a back-end common-mode feedback (CMFB) circuit. The front-end AC-coupled chopper amplifier employs input impedance boosting and digitally-assisted offset trimming. The former increases the input impedance of the active electrode to 2 G\u03a9 at 1 Hz and the latter limits the chopping induced output ripple and residual offset to 2 mV and 20 mV, respectively. Thanks to chopper stabilization, the active electrode achieves 0.8 \u03bcVrms (0.5-100 Hz) input referred noise. The use of a back-end CMFB circuit further improves the CMRR of the active electrode readout to 82 dB at 50 Hz. Both front-end and back-end circuits are implemented in a 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process and the total current consumption of an 8-channel readout system is 88 \u03bcA from 1.8 V supply. EEG measurements using the proposed active electrode system demonstrate its benefits compared to passive electrode systems, namely reduced sensitivity to cable motion artifacts and mains interference.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2170985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2011.2170985","startPage":"555","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/6111547/06078440.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A - 8-Channel Active Electrode System for EEG Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","displayDocTitle":"A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$160~\\mu {\\rm W}$</tex></formula> 8-Channel Active Electrode System for EEG Monitoring","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12425993","pubMedId":"23852553","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078440/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$160~\\mu {\\rm W}$</tex></formula> 8-Channel Active Electrode System for EEG Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tbcas-xu-2170985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115727S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6111547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"6111547","articleId":"6078440","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6078444,"authors":[{"name":"Marta Bagatin","affiliation":["RREACT Group, Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Padova, Padova, Italy","Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Bagatin","id":"37400604500"},{"name":"Simone Gerardin","affiliation":["RREACT Group, Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Gerardin","id":"37283057300"},{"name":"Alessandro Paccagnella","affiliation":["RREACT Group, Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 di Padova, Padova, Italy","Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Paccagnella","id":"37268172700"},{"name":"Angelo Visconti","affiliation":["Numonyx, Research and Development Technology Development, Agrate Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Visconti","id":"37268200900"},{"name":"Silvia Beltrami","affiliation":["Numonyx, Research and Development Technology Development, Agrate Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvia","lastName":"Beltrami","id":"37540661800"},{"name":"Massimo Bertuccio","affiliation":["Numonyx, Research and Development Technology Development, Agrate Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Bertuccio","id":"38071977500"},{"name":"Laura T.

In this work we investigate latent Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects in 41-nm NAND single level cells that do not display neither floating gate errors nor any apparent kind of degradation after exposure. Retention of irradiated cells is analyzed at room and high temperature as a function of total dose previously received. We found that FG cell retention at room temperature is practically unchanged after a total dose up to 30 krad(Si). On the contrary, TID exposure slightly worsens the cell retention time during high-temperature tests. We attribute this behavior to the removal of compensating electrons from the tunnel oxide at high temperature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation effects","Threshold voltage","Flash memory","Bit error rate","X-rays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","flash memories","NAND circuits","reliability","X-ray effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NAND flash cell retention","flash memories","progressive accumulation","intrinsic aging phenomena","latent total ionizing dose effects","NAND single level cells","floating gate errors","irradiated cell retention","floating gate cell retention","total ionizing dose exposure","cell retention time","high-temperature tests","compensating electron removal","tunnel oxide","size 41 nm","temperature 293 K to 298 K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flash memories","floating gate cells","reliability","total dose effects","X-rays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078444","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2011.2171505","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/6093861/06078444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2011.2171505","startPage":"2824","endPage":"2829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Total Ionizing Dose on the Retention of 41-nm NAND Flash Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Total Ionizing Dose on the Retention of 41-nm NAND Flash Cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078444/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2011","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6078444/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12408890","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Total Ionizing Dose on the Retention of 41-nm NAND Flash Cells","sourcePdf":"tns-bagatin-2171505-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074005S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6093861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6093861","articleId":"6078444","onlineDate":"11 November 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6078445,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By the example of an OFDM data link with bandwidth 32 kHz and center frequency 900 kHz this paper gives a detailed view on the effects of out-of-band interferences and their harmonics, the effect of impulsive noise, the influence of analog discrete filters followed by digital filters in the digital domain, and the number of bits in the analog to digital converter (ADC). These aspects are discussed both in frequency and in time domain and various aspects are discussed using the symbol error rate (SER). To exclude influences of imperfect frequency synchronization multipath propagation and synchronization techniques will not be considered and the state of synchronization will be regarded as ideal. With these prerequisites this paper shows the need for a discrete analog filter to protect the ADC. Furthermore, it turns out that the number of bits of the ADC is of minor importance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMI analysis of a generic power line communication OFDM data link","publicationTitle":"10th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"10th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/6064642/6078493/06078659.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"EMI analysis of a generic power line communication OFDM data link","conferenceDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078659/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12360503","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMI analysis of a generic power line communication OFDM data link","confLoc":"York, UK","sourcePdf":"0282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032411S","chronDate":"26-30 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6064642","isNumber":"6078493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6064642","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6078493","articleId":"6078659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EMC Europe","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6078687,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This is due to the fact that MBPC allows fast and accurate control of multiple controlled variables for hybrid systems such as a power electronic converter and its load. As MBPC is a family of possible controllers rather than one single controller, several design choices are to be made when implementing MBPC. In this paper several conceptual possibilities are considered and compared for two important parts of online Finite-Set MBPC (FS-MBPC) algorithm: the cost function in the optimizations step and the prediction model in the prediction step. These possibilities are studied for two different applications of FS-MBPC for power electronics. The cost function is studied in the application of output current and capacitor voltage control of a 3-level flying-capacitor inverter. The aspect of the prediction model is studied for the stator flux and torque control of an induction machine with a 2-level inverter. The two different applications illustrate the versatility of FS-MBPC. In the study concerning the cost function firstly the comparison is made between quadratic and absolute value terms in the cost function. Comparable results are obtained, but a lower resource usage is obtained for the absolute value cost function. Secondly a capacitor voltage tracking control is compared to a control where the capacitor voltage may deviate without cost from the reference up to a certain voltage. The relaxed cost function results in better performance. For the prediction model both a classical, parametric machine model and a back propagation artificial neural network are applied. Both are shown to be capable of a good control quality, the neural network version is much more versatile but has a higher computational burden. However, the number of neurons in the hidden layer should be suffciently high. All studied aspects were verified with experimental results and these validate the simulation results. Even more important is the fact that these experiments prove the feasibility of implementing online finite-set MBPC in an FPGA for both applications.","doi":"10.1109/PRECEDE.2011.6078687","publicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069627/6078679/06078687.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRECEDE.2011.6078687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078679","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design choices for the prediction and optimization stage of finite-set model based predictive control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design choices for the prediction and optimization stage of finite-set model based predictive control","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078687/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377296","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078687/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design choices for the prediction and optimization stage of finite-set model based predictive control","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"P08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065201S","chronDate":"14-15 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069627","isNumber":"6078679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069627","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6078679","articleId":"6078687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6078688,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo P.

The goal of this paper is to gain insight into MU-MIMO detection concepts and their implementation aspects. Various receiver architectures are investigated and their performance are assessed through an advanced link-level simulator. The motivation to study the MU-MIMO detectors rises from the weakness of the co-channel interference-unaware single user detector, the conventional detector for single user MIMO transmission. The most essential problem of these conventional single user detectors in MU-MIMO is the failing to detect signals under the residual interference caused by co-scheduled user, which reduces the performance of the detector. Different practical scenarios have been considered in the evaluation process, namely low and high spatial correlation channels with real channel estimation and feedback delay. Our investigation has shown that single user receivers, such as maximum ratio combiner, show generally poor performance in MU-MIMO scenario and as such they should be neglected for practical implementation. Furthermore, we have shown that the interference rejection combiner achieves the best performance-complexity tradeoff and outperforms conventional single user detectors only with a small increase of computation efforts in signal processing.","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078898.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver performance-complexity tradeoff in LTE MU-MIMO transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Receiver performance-complexity tradeoff in LTE MU-MIMO transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078898/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377086","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078898/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver performance-complexity tradeoff in LTE MU-MIMO transmission","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569467655bai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094487S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6078899,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Abdzadeh-Ziabari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Abdzadeh-Ziabari","id":"38262161300"},{"name":"Mahrokh G.

Currently, the security, in the untrustworthy public environment, is accomplished via IPsec tunnel between the femtocell access point and femto security gateway. This approach is not an advantage in case where an appliance using network address translation is used. Moreover, IPsec was proposed for data transport not voice packet traffic, so that can cause an involuntary data overhead, increase end-to-end delay and decrease the quality of service.

In order to reduce the PAPR with satisfied throughput requirement of the OFDMA systems, the cross-layer design between a resource allocation and a PAPR reduction is proposed. In this paper, a non-selected tone resulted from the optimal subcarrier allocation algorithm, based on the subcarrier's channel gain approach, will be used as a reserved tone. The tradeoff between PAPR and throughput requirement is evaluated by determining the optimal number and position of reserved tone. Performance evaluation of the proposed technique is presented to prove its benefits.

zero-padded symmetric conjugate self-cancellation technique in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by padding zero in between two consecutive symbols for mitigating intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by a frequency offset in MIMO systems. The proposed system is not limited to the real-value channels as required in applying ICI cancellation technique in Alamouti-coded MIMO systems. The proposed system offers advantages of a symmetric conjugate cancellation scheme and MIMO systems such as efficiently mitigating ICI and enhancement of a diversity gain. The property of symmetric conjugate cancellation is investigated, a technique for ICI cancelling and diversity combining is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a lower bit error rate (BER) compared to the ordinary zero-padded MIMO-OFDM systems in AWGN channel. In Rayleigh fading channels, when frequency offset is 1-10%, the proposed system performance, i.e. BER, is significantly improved over the zero-padded conjugate cancellation in MIMO-OFDM systems when the frequency offset is not greater than 10% of subcarrier frequency spacing.","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-padded symmetric conjugate technique for intercarrier interference cancellation in MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078927/","displayDocTitle":"Zero-padded symmetric conjugate technique for intercarrier interference cancellation in MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377112","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078927/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-padded symmetric conjugate technique for intercarrier interference cancellation in MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569472809yiwleak.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065803S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6078930,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Jim\u00e9nez-Pacheco","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Communications Mobiles, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Jim\u00e9nez-Pacheco","id":"38275153900"},{"name":"Onkar Dabeer","affiliation":["School of Technology & Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Onkar","lastName":"Dabeer","id":"37284182100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-963-8111-77-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0682-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-75-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6078930","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Digital video broadcasting","Decoding","Parity check codes","Computer architecture","Read only memory","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","decoding","digital video broadcasting","error statistics","parity check codes","read-only storage","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conflict-free memory-processor architecture","DVB-T2 LDPC decoding","digital video broadcasting-second generation terrestrial","flooding scheduling","serial schedule decoder","BER requirement","general memory arrangement","check-node message processing algorithm","ROM table","bit-error rate requirement","CMOS technology","size 130 nm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a flexible architecture for an LDPC decoder that fully exploits the structure of the codes defined in the DVB-T2 standard (Digital Video Broadcasting - Second Generation Terrestrial). We propose a processor and memory architecture which uses the flooding schedule and has no memory access conflicts, which are encountered in serial schedule decoders proposed in the literature. Thus, unlike previous works, we do not require any extra logic or ad hoc designs to resolve memory conflicts. Despite the typically slower convergence of flooding schedule compared to serial schedule decoders, our architecture meets the throughput and BER requirements specified in the DVB-T2 standard. Our design allows a trade-off between memory size and performance by the selection of the number of bits per message without affecting the general memory arrangement. Besides, our architecture is not algorithm specific: any check-node message processing algorithm can be used (Sum-Product, Min-Sum, etc.) without modifying the basic architecture. Furthermore, by simply adding relevant small ROM tables, we get a decoder that is fully compatible with all three second generation DVB standards (DVB-T2, DVB-S2 and DVB-C2). We present simulation results to demonstrate the viability of our solution both functionally and in terms of the bit-error rate performance. We also discuss the memory requirements and the throughput of the architecture, and present preliminary synthesis results in CMOS 130nm technology.","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078930.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel conflict-free memory and processor architecture for DVB-T2 LDPC decoding","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel conflict-free memory and processor architecture for DVB-T2 LDPC decoding","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377115","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078930/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel conflict-free memory and processor architecture for DVB-T2 LDPC decoding","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569473039jimenezpacheco.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076349S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6078937,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, multiple access interference is one of the main factors limiting the decoding performances. Moreover, these networks suffer from imperfections in up link powers originating from active different users at different locations on the perimeter of the central optical line terminal. In this paper, we examine the near-far impact due to imperfect power control, particularly in the up link passive optical network. We consider two groups of critical users for this purpose. The originality of this work consists in proposing a receiver based on the linear parallel interference cancellation with additional gain factor compensation to mitigate the multiples access interference and to solve the problems of the uncontrolled input power. Link quality of the proposed receiver is analytically established by bit error probability evaluation under the Gaussian approximation. Also, a comparison study to other types of receivers of similar algorithmic complexity is done.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser interference cancellation in a passive network with PON-OCDMA uncontrolled power","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078937.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser interference cancellation in a passive network with PON-OCDMA uncontrolled power","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078937/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377122","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser interference cancellation in a passive network with PON-OCDMA uncontrolled power","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569474453okassa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052912S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6078939,"authors":[{"name":"Zakaria Hanzaz","affiliation":["Chair for Wireless Communications and Navigation, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Zakaria","lastName":"Hanzaz","id":"37689651700"},{"name":"Hans Dieter Schotten","affiliation":["Chair for Wireless Communications and Navigation, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Hans Dieter","lastName":"Schotten","id":"37332572200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-963-8111-77-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0682-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-75-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6078939","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078939","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Modulation","OFDM","Encoding","MIMO","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","MIMO communication","modulation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system interface models","Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access","WiMAX","performance evaluation","wireless communication systems","link-to-system level interface","exponential effective SINR mapping","mutual information effective SINR mapping","single input single output","modulation and coding schemes","multiple input multiple output Alamouti scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Link-to-System interface","multistate channel","OFDM","MIMO Alamouti scheme","EESM","MIESM"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of link to system interface models for WiMAX system","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078939.pdf","abstract":"Nowadays the performance evaluation of wireless communication systems are based on computer simulations. However, the simulation of the whole wireless system becomes a challenging problem. Due to that reason, the whole simulation has been divided into two main levels which are called link level and system level simulations. Therefore, an interface is needed to connect the levels to each other, which is so called Link-to-System (L2S) level interface. This paper is presenting a comparison between two main Link-to-System (L2S) level interface models which are Exponential Effective SINR Mapping (EESM) model and Mutual Information Effective SINR Mapping (MIESM) model which are based on the Effective SINR Mapping concept. In addition, this paper investigates these models based on the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) system. For the case of Single Input Single Output (SISO), the results have shown that these models provide a good accuracy prediction for low modulation and coding schemes and it is decreasing for higher modulation and coding schemes. Furthermore, these models have been extended for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Alamouti scheme which have shown a good accuracy prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078939/","accessionNumber":"12377124","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of link to system interface models for WiMAX system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of link to system interface models for WiMAX system","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569474919hanzaz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042707S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6078943,"authors":[{"name":"M Ratheesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics, University of Kerala Kariavattom, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"M Ratheesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085462001"},{"name":"V P Mahadevan Pillai","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics, University of Kerala Kariavattom, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"V P Mahadevan","lastName":"Pillai","id":"37641834800"},{"name":"K G Gopchandran","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics, University of Kerala Kariavattom, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"K G","lastName":"Gopchandran","id":"37991382700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-963-8111-77-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0682-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-75-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6078943","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical fiber devices","Optical fiber amplifiers","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","optical communication","optical links","Q-factor","telecommunication network topology","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion managed return-to-zero pulse","wavelength division multiplexed optical communication system","WDM","single mode fiber","optical communication link","bit error rate","Q-factor","optical spectrum analysis","timing jitters","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit rate","disperion managed fiber","eye diagram","optical spectrum analysis","Q-factor"]}],"abstract":"This paper reports the design and simulation of a 10Gbps optical communication system with dispersion managed RZ pulse.

The analysis has been performed in terms of bit error rate, Q-factor, optical spectrum analysis and average eye opening. It is observed that as the value of dispersion parameter is increases, the Q-factor and the average eye opening also increases.

Dense femtocell access point (FAP) deployment however, can lead to severe interference on femtocell user equipment (FUE) from neighbouring FAP, when they operate on the same channel. The problem is compounded as FAP are deployed in an uncoordinated manner by the end-user, which means either avoiding or minimising interference is an essential prerequisite to achieve successful femtocell operation. This paper adopts a new strategy towards radio resource distribution and management by creating virtual clusters of femtocells which are managed by a logical entity called the Virtual Cluster Controller(VCC). Each VCC is situated between the FAPs and Radio Network Controller (RNC) and has a set of sub-channels which it can allocate amongst its members. A Virtual Cluster Formation (VCF) algorithm exploits location information to assign each FAP to a VCC so that the minimum distance between a FAP and the nearest FAP allocated to the same VCC is maximised, thereby ensuring minimal inter-FAP interference. Simulation results corroborate the significant performance improvement achieved by this virtual clustering model in terms of both interference minimisation and throughput for various FAP deployment scenarios.","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078960.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual clustering for resource management in cognitive femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Virtual clustering for resource management in cognitive femtocell networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377145","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual clustering for resource management in cognitive femtocell networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569475985tariq.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0564S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6078974,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The most stringent ones are the resources that the femtocells should be using and the interference between the macro and the femto layers. We propose an unsupervised learning algorithm, namely reinforcement learning as the means of achieving self-organizing capabilities for the femtocells. The proposed algorithm is characterized by femto-QoS awareness, as the actions of the femtocells are directed at avoiding interference on the macro layer but at the same time achieving the QoS requirements of the femtocells. Dealing with OFDMA based systems, different service classes for both the macro and the femto users are envisioned and equal priority is assigned among users. The different QoS requirements allow applying a Markov chain prediction on the number of resources required by a femtocell, enhancing the performance of the algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested in a highly dynamic environment in which the allocation of resources to the macro users can change at each time step.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS aware reinforcement learning algorithm for macro-femto interference in dynamic environments","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078977.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A QoS aware reinforcement learning algorithm for macro-femto interference in dynamic environments","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078977/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377162","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS aware reinforcement learning algorithm for macro-femto interference in dynamic environments","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569476353stefan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076954S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6078980,"authors":[{"name":"Adisorn Lertsinsrubtavee","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatiqe de Paris 6 (LIP6), Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Adisorn","lastName":"Lertsinsrubtavee","id":"38230604800"},{"name":"Naceur Malouch","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatiqe de Paris 6 (LIP6), Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Naceur","lastName":"Malouch","id":"37295174700"},{"name":"Serge Fdida","affiliation":["Laboratoire dInformatiqe de Paris 6 (LIP6), Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Fdida","id":"37295179000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-963-8111-77-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0682-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-75-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6078980","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Channel estimation","Cognitive radio","Switches","Availability","Estimation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","probability","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","spectrum handoff","channel availability","channel handoffs","delay bounds","handoff operation","secondary user","cumulative probability estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078980","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","abstract":"The existing spectrum handoff techniques for cognitive radio perform handoff based solely on channel availability. This can result in a frequent number of channel handoffs and cannot ensure the quality requirement of applications such as delay bounds. This paper proposes the use of cumulative probability based on past backlog measurements to determine whether and how to perform handoffs. In order to prevent unnecessary handoff operation, secondary user should keep the same channel as long as the cumulative probability estimation does not violate some bound. However, the estimation from past observations may not correspond to the the real behavior in the immediate future even if efficient prediction models are employed. Thus, we propose the use of backup channels for short time periods to alleviate this problem. We analyze our strategies through extensive simulations and we compare them to random and classic approaches. Results show that our proposed strategies significantly reduce the number of channel handoffs up to 76% while still supporting the delay bound requirement.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078980.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum handoff strategy using cumulative probability in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078980/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum handoff strategy using cumulative probability in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377165","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum handoff strategy using cumulative probability in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569476729lertsinsrubtavee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060028S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6078982,"authors":[{"name":"Asuman Yavano\u011flu","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Asuman","lastName":"Yavano\u011flu","id":"38230618400"},{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ertu\u011f","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Ertu\u011f","id":"38222779000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-963-8111-77-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0682-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-75-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6078982","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":399},"abstract":"The recent developments in wireless communication systems in indoor environments require high data rates and high transmission qualities especially for the support of multimedia applications in WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) systems.

The study investigates the effect of phase jitter on the system Bit Error Rate (BER) of the DFT/DWT-based OFDM for different modulation schemes in the presence of optical sub-system's nonlinearities in AWGN channel. The results of this research show that at low phase noise levels, some DWT-based schemes outperform DFT-based scheme, however they achieve the same performance at high phase noise levels. It is understood that RoF systems are less robust against phase noise compared to their linear counterparts. Also, increasing modulation order leads to an increase in sensitivity to phase noise regardless of the Multi-Carrier (MC) scheme used. Furthermore, the performance of some wavelets are slightly different, especially at low \u03c3 (the variance of the phase noise) values. Finally, QAM signals are more robust against phase noise compared to PSK signals in RoF systems.","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078996.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance assessment of OFDM-based and OWDM-based Radio-over-Fiber systems in the presence of phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance assessment of OFDM-based and OWDM-based Radio-over-Fiber systems in the presence of phase noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078996/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377181","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6078996/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance assessment of OFDM-based and OWDM-based Radio-over-Fiber systems in the presence of phase noise","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569480727baghersalimi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048545S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6078997,"authors":[{"name":"Gholamreza Baghersalimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Baghersalimi","id":"37680548700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-963-8111-77-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0682-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-963-8111-75-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-023X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0221"},{"format":"CD","value":"2157-0221"}],"articleNumber":"6078997","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"abstract":"In this paper the impact of a Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) subsystem on the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Total Degradations (TD) performances of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) is evaluated. The study investigates the use of pilot-aided channel estimation to compensate for the optical subsystem's nonlinearities in the presence of AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise), different load factors (LFs,) and Spreading Factors (SFs). The results show that pilot-aided channel estimation is an effective method for compensating the impairments of the optical subsystem.

Also, SF has more impact on the system performance in comparison to LF.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069625/6078843/06078997.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078843","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6078997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance study of optical subsystem equalization in a WCDMA-based Radio-over-Fiber communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical distortion","Optical receivers","Bit error rate","Nonlinear optics","Channel estimation","Optical filters","Fiber optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical subsystem equalization","wideband code division multiple access","WCDMA","radio-over-fiber communication system","bit error rate","total degradation performance","pilot-aided channel estimation","AWGN","load factor","spreading factor","pilot power level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RoF","WCDMA","Pilot-Aided Channel Equalization","TD","BER","Load Factor","Spreading Factor","AWGN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6078997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A performance study of optical subsystem equalization in a WCDMA-based Radio-over-Fiber communication system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6078997/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377182","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance study of optical subsystem equalization in a WCDMA-based Radio-over-Fiber communication system","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"m1569480729baghersalimi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039205S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069625","isNumber":"6078843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069625","xplore-issue":"6078843","articleId":"6078997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"HTE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6079085,"authors":[{"name":"S.

MBPC allows fast and accurate control of multiple controlled variables for hybrid systems such as a power electronic converter and its load. The computational burden for this control scheme however is very high and often restrictive for a good implementation. This means that a suitable technology and design approach should be used. In this paper the implementation of finite-set MBPC (FS-MBPC) in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is discussed. The control is fully implemented in programmable digital logic by using a high-level design tool. This allows to obtain very good performances (both in control quality, speed and hardware utilization) and have a flexible, modular control configuration. The feasibility and performance of the FPGA implementation of FS-MBPC is discussed in this paper for a 4-level flying-capacitor converter (FCC). This is an interesting application as FS-MBPC allows the simultaneous control of the output current and the capacitor voltages, yet the high number of possible switch states results in a high computational load. The good performance is obtained by exploiting the FPGA's strong points: parallelism and pipe-lining. In the application discussed in this paper the parallel processing for the three converter phases and a fully pipelined calculation of the prediction stage allow to realize an area-time efficient implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of online finite-set model based predictive control for power electronics","doi":"10.1109/PRECEDE.2011.6079085","startPage":"63","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRECEDE.2011.6079085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078679","publicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Workshop on Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069627/6078679/06079085.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of online finite-set model based predictive control for power electronics","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6079085/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377301","conferenceDate":"14-15 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of online finite-set model based predictive control for power electronics","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"P10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057654S","chronDate":"14-15 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069627","isNumber":"6078679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069627","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6078679","articleId":"6079085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6079090,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The principle of femtocell to the mobile operators is to reduce cost and improve signal quality in indoor coverage which is also considered a possible path to the fixed-mobile convergence (FMC) goal. Femtocell extends network coverage and delivers high-quality mobile services inside residential and business buildings through broadband network, i.e. ADSL. Femtocell access point (FAP) or home base station (HBS) intends to serve small number of users, i.e. 4 users and covers about 30 meter square similar to existing WiFi access points. However, femtocell introduces new challenges to the telecom industries in terms of handoff between femto and macrocells, interference management, localization and synchronization. Among all of these challenges, synchronization is considered corner stone for proper working for femtocell. The problematic issue in femtocell synchronization is that all the data and control traffics travel through IP broadband network. The IP broadband network is usually owned and managed by third party and not by the mobile operator, which is complicated the synchronization. Unsynchronized FAPs may cause harm interferences and wrong handover dictions. In this study we investigate and overview the current femtocell synchronization techniques and compare between them. Possible improvements and recommendation for each method is identified. Proposed schemes and indicated future research areas are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079232","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069624/6079225/06079232.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079225","startPage":"196","endPage":"201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation of femtocell network synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An investigation of femtocell network synchronization","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079232/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12361245","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6079232/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of femtocell network synchronization","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569461567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062385S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069624","isNumber":"6079225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069624","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6079225","articleId":"6079232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6079245,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Wind","affiliation":["Business Informatics and Systems Engineering, University of Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Wind","id":"37888909300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-931-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-930-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079245","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1692},"abstract":"An increase in the development and use of Open Source (OS) has been observed in recent years, in particular in the fields of programming, operating systems, and application software. According to studies carried out by Gartner and Forrester however, OS is not yet used intensively for structuring and managing cloud computing platforms. This is all the more remarkable in that it is in this field in particular that it would be possible to structure cloud management platforms efficiently and cost-effectively using the OS systems available today. They are available as alternatives to commercial suppliers and enable private, hybrid and community cloud solutions to be implemented. However, many commercial enterprises, public administrations and other institutions do not take advantage of them, partly due to uncertainty and a lack of information about such possibilities. This article therefore examines this subject, compares existing Open Source cloud computing management platforms and provides specific recommendations for use.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069624/6079225/06079245.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079225","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open source cloud computing management platforms: Introduction, comparison, and recommendations for implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Communities","Computer architecture","Clouds","Virtual machining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","operating systems (computers)","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open source cloud computing management platforms","OS","operating systems","software application","commercial enterprises","public administrations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Open Source","Cloud Computing","Open Source Cloud Computing Management Platforms","Eucalyptus","OpenNebula","Abicloud","Nimbus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Open source cloud computing management platforms: Introduction, comparison, and recommendations for implementation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6079245/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12361255","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open source cloud computing management platforms: Introduction, comparison, and recommendations for implementation","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569461003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068802S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069624","isNumber":"6079225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069624","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6079225","articleId":"6079245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6079295,"authors":[{"name":"Atif Jamil","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Atif","lastName":"Jamil","id":"37994237600"},{"name":"Mohd Zuki Yusoff","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Zuki","lastName":"Yusoff","id":"37718281000"},{"name":"Noorhana Yahya","affiliation":["Fundamental and Applied Science Department, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Noorhana","lastName":"Yahya","id":"37863708500"},{"name":"M.

This has posed several challenges for the researchers. These challenges include but are not limited to size reduction, high efficiency, and low-cost. The prevailing fashion in the communication system is to integrate several WLAN standards in small user equipment. The emergence of the USB dongle for WLAN has attracted the antenna design engineers to design multi band antennas. The antenna size is restricted to the small size of the USB dongle. The main challenge is to reduce the antenna size without compromising on the performance related characteristics such as; wide bandwidth, low VSWR, high gain and high radiation efficiency. In this paper a novel Koch-meander Fractal antenna has been proposed for the application of WLAN USB dongle. The proposed compact antenna is simulated in CST microwave studio. The simulation results depicts that the antenna has a -10 dB return loss bandwidth of 2.2909-2.553 GHz and 5.1406-5.8737 GHz. The minimum return loss of -28.9 dB is achieved at the lower band of 2.41 GHz. While the upper band depicts a return loss of -20.8 dB at 5.36 GHz. The proposed antenna is capable of covering the whole band required for the WLAN 802.11 a/b/g standards.","doi":"10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079295","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069624/6079225/06079295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079225","startPage":"290","endPage":"293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact multiband hybrid meander-Koch Fractal antenna for WLAN USB dongle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compact multiband hybrid meander-Koch Fractal antenna for WLAN USB dongle","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079295/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12361305","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6079295/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact multiband hybrid meander-Koch Fractal antenna for WLAN USB dongle","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569435005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040784S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069624","isNumber":"6079225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069624","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6079225","articleId":"6079295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6079297,"authors":[{"name":"Beh Boon Chun","affiliation":["School of Physic, University of Sains Malaysia, Minden, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Beh Boon","lastName":"Chun","id":"37903763500"},{"name":"Mohd.

Mangrove forest is a unique and natural ecosystem that can be used to produce forestry product such as charcoal, timber, supply food to their surrounding marine life, and protect the inland from disturbance like erosion, flood, and tsunami. Due to the uncontrolled planning of human activity, many mangrove forests had been deforested for development of industry area, urban land and agriculture. In this study, Multi-layer Feed Forward/Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) network system in Artificial Neural Network technique was used to map out the current state of mangrove trees. This network system require user to have a ground truth data such as in supervised classification in order to generate the training area for classification. Generally, this network comprise of a simple structure layer which consist of three layers namely input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Multi-layer Feed Forward algorithm has at least one hidden layer of neuron between the input and output layer. Each successive layer of neurons is fully interconnected with connection weight determine the strength of the connection. 2010 Thailand Earth Observing System (THEOS) satellite imagery was used as the source for the data processing with the aid of PCI Geomatica version 10.3.2 software packaging. The classification result of Multi-layer Feed Forward yield 5 category of classes. Post-classification analysis was further carried out to validate the classified data with reference data. High overall accuracy of 93.5% and kappa coefficient of 0.900 was obtained for the mangrove cover mapping. Final thematic map was produce to quantify and display the current distribution of mangrove land. The result indicates that neural network approach is suitable and reliable used for mangrove mapping.","doi":"10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079297","pdfPath":"/iel5/6069624/6079225/06079297.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"249","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Conference on Open Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOS.2011.6079297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mangrove mapping in Penang Island by using Artificial Neural Network technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mangrove mapping in Penang Island by using Artificial Neural Network technique","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12361307","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6079297/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mangrove mapping in Penang Island by using Artificial Neural Network technique","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1569434867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088286S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6069624","isNumber":"6079225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6069624","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6079225","articleId":"6079297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6079311,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Mohamed Talib","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & IT Information System Department, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Amir Mohamed","lastName":"Talib","id":"38242057400"},{"name":"Rodziah Atan","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & IT Information System Department, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rodziah","lastName":"Atan","id":"37396457700"},{"name":"Rusli Abdullah","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & IT Information System Department, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rusli","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"37409897900"},{"name":"Masrah Azrifah","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science & IT Information System Department, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Masrah","lastName":"Azrifah","id":"37085562965"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-931-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-930-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079311","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1487},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Data security","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","cloud computing","Java","multi-agent systems","software architecture","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CloudZone","cloud data storage","multiagent system architecture","computing power","cloud computing environment","data center","data integrity checking","data structure","online cloud service","integrity layered architecture","MAS architecture","cloud resources layer","cloud server-side","cloud client-side","cloud service provider agent","cloud data integrity backup agent","Prometheus methodology","Java agent development framework security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","cloud data storage","cloud service provider","integrity","multi agent system"]}],"abstract":"The computing power in a cloud computing environments is supplied by a collection of data centers, or cloud data storages (CDSs) housed in many different locations and interconnected by high speed networks.

These models also affect haptic rendering algorithms which are often based on collision with polygons. We use mathematical functions to define and implement geometry (curves, surfaces and solid objects), visual appearance (3D colors and geometric textures) and various tangible physical properties (elasticity, friction, viscosity, and force fields). The function definitions are given as analytical formulas (explicit, implicit and parametric), function scripts and procedures. Since the defining functions are very small we can efficiently use them in collaborative virtual environments to exchange between the participating clients. We proposed an algorithm for haptic rendering of virtual scenes including mutually penetrating objects with different sizes and arbitrary location of the observer without a prior knowledge of the scene to be rendered. The algorithm is based on casting multiple haptic rendering rays from the Haptic Interaction Point (HIP), and it builds a stack to keep track on all colliding objects with the HIP. The algorithm uses collision detection based on implicit function representation of the object surfaces. The proposed approach allows us to be flexible when choosing the actual rendering platform. The function-defined objects and parts constituting them can be used together with other common definitions of virtual objects such as polygon meshes, point sets, voxel volumes, etc. We implemented an extension of X3D and VRML which allows for defining complex geometry, appearance and haptic effects in virtual scenes by functions and common polygon-based models, with various object sizes, mutual penetrations, arbitrary location of the observer and variable precision.","doi":"10.1109/CW.2011.19","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyberworlds","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyberworlds","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079162/6079326/06079368.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2011.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Function-Based Haptic Interaction in Cyberworlds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079368/","displayDocTitle":"Function-Based Haptic Interaction in Cyberworlds","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377981","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6079368/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Function-Based Haptic Interaction in Cyberworlds","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4467a217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038798S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079162","isNumber":"6079326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079162","xplore-issue":"6079326","articleId":"6079368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6079371,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00eblle Tilmanne","affiliation":["Numediart Institute / TCTS Laboratory, University of Mons-UMONS, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jo\u00eblle","lastName":"Tilmanne","id":"38096627200"},{"name":"Thierry Dutoit","affiliation":["Numediart Institute / TCTS Laboratory, University of Mons-UMONS, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Dutoit","id":"37281989900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1453-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4467-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079371","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"abstract":"In this work, we present a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based stylistic walk synthesizer, where the synthesized styles are combinations or exaggerations of the walk styles present in the training database. In a first stage, Hidden Markov Models of eleven different styles of gait are trained, using a database of motion capture walk sequences. In a second stage, the probability density functions inside the stylistic models are interpolated or extrapolated in order to synthesize walks with styles or style intensities that were not present in the training database. A continuous model of the style parameter space is thus constructed around the eleven original walk styles. An informal user evaluation of the synthesized sequences showed that the naturalness of motions is preserved after linear interpolation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyberworlds","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079162/6079326/06079371.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyberworlds","doi":"10.1109/CW.2011.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2011.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Control of Style through Linear Interpolation in Hidden Markov Model Based Stylistic Walk Synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Databases","Training","Interpolation","Adaptation models","Three dimensional displays","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer animation","hidden Markov models","interpolation","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous style control","linear interpolation","hidden Markov model","stylistic walk synthesizer","training database","motion capture walk sequences","probability density functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HMM","gait","style","control","synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Control of Style through Linear Interpolation in Hidden Markov Model Based Stylistic Walk Synthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6079371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377984","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Control of Style through Linear Interpolation in Hidden Markov Model Based Stylistic Walk Synthesis","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"4467a232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053694S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079162","isNumber":"6079326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079162","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6079326","articleId":"6079371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6079388,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Li","id":"38240995300"},{"name":"Yang Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37898283900"},{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537571800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1827-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4557-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079388","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Parallel processing","Benchmark testing","Computer architecture","Discrete Fourier transforms","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","fast Fourier transforms","parallel architectures","parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transform","heterogeneous platform","architecture","supercomputer","CPU","portability problem","OpenFFT-bench","FFT application","OpenCL-based FFT","real-time spectrum visualization","OpenCL programming","NVIDIA CUDA","ATI Stream","Intel OpenCL. characteristics","GPU-based platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OpenFFT-Bench","OpenCL","CUDA","heterogeneous platforms"]}],"abstract":"Heterogeneous platforms, integrating SMPs, clusters, GPUs, FPGAs, etc. are becoming the most popular architectures of supercomputers. Achieving high performance on CPUs or GPUs requires careful consideration of their different architectures, which challenges the capability and skills of programmers. In order to overcome the portability problem, OpenCL, a free cross-platform programming standard, is proposed by Khronos Compute Working Group. However, the performance of OpenCL-based programs has not been thoroughly studied yet. Therefore, in this paper, we first design OpenFFT-Bench, an FFT application with OpenCL-based FFT and OpenGL-based real-time spectrum visualization as the benchmark. We evaluate its performance on four OpenCL programming platforms including NVIDIA CUDA, ATI Stream (GPU), ATI Stream (CPU), and Intel OpenCL. Characteristics of OpenFFT-Bench are investigated with multiple FFT sizes. Experimental results show that OpenCL and OpenGL-based applications can not only run on multiple heterogeneous platforms, but also achieve relatively high performance on GPU-based platforms.","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2011.48","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079161/6079382/06079388.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2011.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Fast Fourier Transform Application on Heterogeneous Platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079388/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Fast Fourier Transform Application on Heterogeneous Platforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377864","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6079388/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Fast Fourier Transform Application on Heterogeneous Platforms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4557a241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066801S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079161","isNumber":"6079382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079161","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6079382","articleId":"6079388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6079389,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiu-Pang Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiu-Pang","lastName":"Yeh","id":"38230945700"},{"name":"Yue-Shan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National Taipei University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yue-Shan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37598513700"},{"name":"Chia-Feng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Feng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278407200"},{"name":"Shyan-Ming Yuan","affiliation":["College of Computing and Informatics, Providence University, Taichung, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyan-Ming","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37278196500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1827-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4557-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079389","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating 3-DES Performance Using GPU","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079161/6079382/06079389.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"256","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2011.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079382","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2011.49","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Encryption","Computer architecture","Programming","Hardware","Web servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","cryptography","Internet","online front-ends"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerating 3-DES performance","cryptography algorithm","data security","storage security","personal identification","secure Web browsing","decrypting request","graphics processing unit","data encryption","data decryption","Web server","GPU cipher","OpenSSL implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Encryption Standard","GPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079389","abstract":"Various cryptography algorithms have developed to provide different levels of data security for application domains, such as storage security, personal identification, and secure web browsing.

In such sequential channel sensing framework, it is critical important to arrange the channel sensing order properly at the beginning of each time slot, so as to balance the tradeoff between finding an idle channel as soon as possible in current slot (exploitation by sensing currently looks better channel preferentially) and making the channel statistics more precise to benefit the following sensing order arrangement (exploration by sensing the channels currently looks suboptimal). To handle this tradeoff balancing problem, we propose five online learning algorithms: Pure Exploitation (PE), Exploitation with Optimism Initial Estimation (EOIE), UCB-based Order (UCBO), \u03b5-greedy Order and SoftMax Order. The latter three algorithms are extended from three classic algorithms on handling multi-armed bandit problem: UCB1 [1], \u03b5-greedy [2] and SoftMax [2]. Among these algorithms, UCBO is the only one that we have proved to be a zero-regret strategy, which means the system is guaranteed to achieve optimal sensing order by applying UCBO, if enough slots are played. We then evaluate the algorithms by simulations. The results are a little surprising but meaningful. We find that the PE algorithm, which is treated as a simple strategy with poor performance for traditional multi-armed bandit problems, performs very well in the order learning problem when the number of channels is small. And our proposed EOIE algorithm performs nearly optimal in all cases. In contrast, the UCB-based Order converges too slowly for actual application, although it provides theoretical zero-regret guarantee as we have proved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12377915","htmlLink":"/document/6079439/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Non-Bayesian Learning of Channel Sensing Order for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Bayesian Learning of Channel Sensing Order for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4557a529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076686S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079161","isNumber":"6079382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079161","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6079382","articleId":"6079439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6079441,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Chen","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Chen","id":"38241178600"},{"name":"Yang Jun","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Jun","id":"37415412400"},{"name":"Zhang Meng","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Meng","id":"38230936700"},{"name":"Wu Xiulong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Xiulong","id":"37719887700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1827-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4557-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079441","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Transistors","Robustness","Arrays","Threshold voltage","System-on-a-chip","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","integrated circuit design","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["12T subthreshold SRAM bit-cell","medical device application","Schmitt Trigger","optimum-energy supply voltage point","SoC design","Vopt","weak sub-threshold region","nearthreshold region","degraded robustness","structural change","6T SRAM","voltage 400 mV","voltage 1200 mV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","optimum energy-per-operation","static noise margin","medical device"]}],"abstract":"A Schmitt Trigger based SRAM 12T bit-cell is proposed to operate under optimum-energy supply voltage for medical device application.

As a result, the robustness problem arises due to the low-power operation. Considering about this degraded robustness, structural change instead of the sizing change is considered in this paper. The proposed design has 45% improvement of the SNM compared to the conventional 6T SRAM bit-cell. Due to the wide hysteresis effect, the proposed design also exhibits more robust to process variations. Its hold margin is 30.2% greater than conventional 6T SRAM. The optimum-energy supply voltage of proposed array (256\u00d716) is 400 mV.

It first exploits an optimal threshold to get the optimal task grouping and leverage task duplication algorithm to reduce schedule length and communication energy, and then schedules the applications on DVS-enabled processors that can scale down their voltages to reduce computation energy whenever tasks have slack time due to task dependencies. Using simulations we show our algorithm not only maintains good performance, but also has a good improvement on energy efficiency for parallel applications.","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2011.58","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079161/6079382/06079450.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2011.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Threshold-Based Energy Efficient Scheduling Algorithm for Parallel Tasks on Homogeneous DVS-Enabled Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Threshold-Based Energy Efficient Scheduling Algorithm for Parallel Tasks on Homogeneous DVS-Enabled Clusters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377926","htmlLink":"/document/6079450/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Threshold-Based Energy Efficient Scheduling Algorithm for Parallel Tasks on Homogeneous DVS-Enabled Clusters","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4557a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079014S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079161","isNumber":"6079382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079161","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6079382","articleId":"6079450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6079459,"authors":[{"name":"Jaechun No","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Sejong University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaechun","lastName":"No","id":"37431851000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1827-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4557-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079459","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid File System Using NAND-Flash SSD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Resource management","File systems","Partitioning algorithms","Bandwidth","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","file organisation","hard discs","NAND circuits","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid file system","NAND-flash SSD","HDD","N-hybrid","flexible internal structure","sequential performance","legacy file system","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SSD","hybrid file system","data section"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a hybrid file system, called N-hybrid (New-form of hybrid) file system, whose main objective is to integrate the strengths of HDD and SSD, to provide a large-scale file system space in a cost-effective way.

Though it is of significant importance to carry out studies on such programming models, so far, there are few programming models for cloud computing. Because various kinds of cloud platforms are developed independently, it is necessary to have the support of cloud platform in making cloud programming model be able to deploy application to the cloud. This paper takes the cloud platform as its center. The cloud computing model in this paper is proposed as the Cloud platform, which is a kind of distributed structure without central management node. Each cloud node has equal status and manages its local resources respectively. In addition, this paper proposes mechanisms for resource management and allocation as well as the organizational structure of the user virtual machine.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079161/6079382/06079470.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"446","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2011.78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2011.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Model without Resource Management Center","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Resource management","Virtual machining","Programming","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource management center","cloud platform","resource allocation","user virtual machine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","IaaS","programming model","virtual machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing Model without Resource Management Center","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6079470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12377943","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing Model without Resource Management Center","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4557a442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058774S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079161","isNumber":"6079382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079161","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6079382","articleId":"6079470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6079487,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Jy Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jong-Jy","lastName":"Shyu","id":"37312363500"},{"name":"Soo-Chang Pei","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Soo-Chang","lastName":"Pei","id":"37271112500"},{"name":"Yun-Da Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yun-Da","lastName":"Huang","id":"37309659300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1397-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4517-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079487","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079487","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Filter banks","Low pass filters","Filtering theory","Prototypes","Cutoff frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","least squares approximations","shapes (structures)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D FIR cone-shaped filter design","McClellan transformation","least-squares contour mapping","inclination degree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cone shaped filter","FIR filter","McClellan transformation","least-squares method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IIHMSP.2011.42","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6079160/6079486/06079487.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIHMSP.2011.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of 3-D FIR Cone-Shaped Filters by McClellan Transformation and Least-Squares Contour Mapping","abstract":"In this paper, the techniques of McClellan transformation and least-squares contour mapping are applied for the design of 3-D FIR cone-shaped filters directly.

When coding with the Turbo UEP encoder, both of the two parity bits are reserved for the high error protection bits, and for the low error protection bits, most bits hold one parity bit, while in order to obtain a 1/2 coding rate, some bits are selected randomly and have no parity bit. So this UEP scheme has an unchanged coding rate and realizes the UEP capability in one coding process. Then we apply this Turbo UEP code to the transmission of the DCT compressed images. The DCT coefficients those are more sensitive to channel noise are provided high error protection level, and the remaining coefficients are provided low error protection level. By this means, the quality of the image transmission is improved and there is no additional bit rate or coding delay due to the UEP capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6079508/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","accessionNumber":"12377756","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Scheme to Improve the Quality of Compressed Image Transmission by Turbo Unequal Error Protection Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Scheme to Improve the Quality of Compressed Image Transmission by Turbo Unequal Error Protection Codes","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"4517a226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083277S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079160","isNumber":"6079486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079160","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6079486","articleId":"6079508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6079545,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Huang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Huang","id":"38236872200"},{"name":"Kouichi Sakurai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kouichi","lastName":"Sakurai","id":"37266233200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1397-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4517-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079545","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":933},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Robustness","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Image coding","Matching pursuit algorithms","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","data compression","Gaussian distribution","image coding","random sequences","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compression-combined digital image encryption method","compressive sensing","consecutive packet loss","malicious shear attack","dimensional reduction","random projection","digital image compression","block Arnold scrambling","bit wise XOR operation","quantized binary bit stream","Gaussian distribution property","cipher image","one dimensional logistic mapping","chaotic sequence generation","block Arnold transformation","pseudo-random sequence","brute force attack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","image encryption","block Arnold scrambling","Logistic mapping","consecutive packet loss","shear attack"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079545","abstract":"This paper proposes a compression-combined digital image encryption method which is robust against consecutive packet loss and malicious shear attack.

In order to imitate the structure and the function of human brain better, it is more logical to combine chaos with neural networks. In this paper we proposed a chaotic learning algorithm called Maximized Gradient function and Modulated Chaos (MGMC). MGMC maximizes the gradient function and also added a modulated version of chaos in learning rate (LR) as well as in activation function. Activation function made adaptive by using chaos as gain factor. MGMC generates a chaotic time series as modulated form of Mackey Glass, Logistic Map and Lorenz Attractor. A rescaled version of this series is used as learning rate (LR) called Modulated Learning Rate (MLR) during NN training. As a result neural network becomes biologically plausible and may get escaped from local minima zone and faster convergence rate is obtained as maximizing the derivative of activation function together with minimizing the error function. MGMC is extensively tested on three real world benchmark classification problems such as australian credit card, wine and soybean identification. The proposed MGMC outperforms the existing BP and BPfast in terms of generalization ability and also convergence rate.","doi":"10.1109/ISCID.2011.18","startPage":"36","endPage":"39","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Fourth International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and

In order to decide the substation-planning scheme in each stage simultaneously, this work put forward a new method for getting initial feasible solution. The initial feasible solution makes load points in every stage into consideration by classifying new substations into several classes. Based on the initial feasible solution, we present Hop field neural network to calculate each substation's planning scheme in every stage simultaneously. The energy function of the neural network and calculation algorithm are given in this paper. A real multi-stage planning example is also given, and the comparison between the calculated scheme and the scheme that is done by power institution shows that the presented algorithm is effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6079649/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12378179","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6079649/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Multi-stage Distribution Substation Planning Algorithm Based on Multilayer Hopfield Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Multi-stage Distribution Substation Planning Algorithm Based on Multilayer Hopfield Neural Network","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4500a114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096047S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6079223","isNumber":"6079565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6079223","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6079565","articleId":"6079649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6079651,"authors":[{"name":"Shuying Zhao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Shuying","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37601184400"},{"name":"Dan Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38239459500"},{"name":"Xiangman Song","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Xiangman","lastName":"Song","id":"37071066400"},{"name":"Wenjun Tan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Tan","id":"37590888100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1085-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6079651","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Level set","Hippocampus","Image edge detection","Wavelet transforms","Capacitance-voltage characteristics","Nonhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","diseases","edge detection","image segmentation","medical image processing","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hippocampus segmentation","MRI images","level set improvement","signal to noise ratio","SNR","edge information","regional information","external energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["the hippocampus","level set","image segmentation","intensity inhomogeneities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6079651","abstract":"For hippocampus of MRI demonstrating the low contrast, low signal to noise ratio(SNR), boundary discrete, intensity in homogeneities features, this paper proposed an improved level set model that based on regional and edge information.

GA can find the optimal weights and biases of the neutral network which will avoid meeting the local optimal value. The experimental results of this identification system show that PCA-GA-BPNN gives superior predictions over ordinary neutral network.
