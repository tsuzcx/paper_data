Inertial orientation tracking combined with RF positioning provides an accurate method for determining end effector orientation and location. The same technology could also be used to determine human posture for the purpose of inserting humans in synthetic environments. Orientation filters based upon Euler angles suffer from singularities. This paper describes the design, implementation, and preliminary testing of an inertial tracking system using a \"complementary\" filter based upon quaternions. This filter is capable of tracking a rigid body through all orientations and is more efficient than those based on Euler angles. Results of qualitative tests of a prototype inertial angle tracking device are presented.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.1999.810047","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation.

The approach is formulated as a problem of controlling the pose of a vision system with the goal of minimizing the uncertainties of the motion estimates. A Kalman filter is employed as the object motion estimation algorithm. The uncertainties of the motion estimates are represented by the variances of the estimates produced by Kalman filter. These variances are updated by a Riccati equation which is constructed as a function of the vision system parameters. A hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal vision system parameters that minimize the uncertainties of the motion estimates. This hybrid algorithm incorporates the concept of Boltzman's probability from simulated annealing. To improve the speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm an adaptive gradient based search method is also developed.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation.

Automatic creation of such maps is still an unrealized goal, especially in environments that have large cyclical structures. Drawing on recent techniques of global registration and correlation, we present a method, called local registration and global correlation, for reliable reconstruction of consistent global maps from dense range data. The method is attractive because it is incremental, producing an updated map with every new sensor input; and runs in constant time independent of the size of the map (except when closing large cycles). A real-time implementation and results are presented for several indoor environments.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.1999.810068","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation.

The methodology combines the standard finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with a non-symmetric Lanczos eigenvalue algorithm to generate directly a Pade approximation of the electromagnetic response of the structure over the frequency range of interest. The numerical implementation is such that each iteration of the Lanczos algorithm is computationally equivalent to the update of the electromagnetic fields in the FDTD algorithm. However, no time stepping is required. Thus, both the time step-imposed numerical stability constraint of the FDTD algorithm and its time step-controlled frequency resolution are relaxed. The proposed methodology generates the continuous response of the system at a fraction of the computational cost required by the FDTD method. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated through several numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1999.810127","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatability.

Two parallel operators produce offspring and fulfil specific roles: self-reproduction with mutation (SRM) as a permanent source of diversity to induce the appearance of beneficial mutations and crossover and mutation (CM) to propagate them in the population. An extinctive selection mechanism subjects CM's and SRM's offspring to compete for survival and to guarantee the preservation of beneficial mutations for the next generation. SRM is implemented with an adaptive mutation schedule, which acts depending on SRM's contribution to the actual population, to keep control of the exploration-exploitation balance. Two adaptive mutation schemes are investigated for SRM, adaptive dynamic segment (ADS) and adaptive dynamic probability (ADP). CM's mutation is used to create the appropriate conditions in which SRM's offspring could be competitive with CM's offspring. Thus the expected cooperation between CM and SRM emerges resulting in higher convergence velocity and higher convergence reliability. The proposed model is tested with the 0/1 multiple knapsack NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem where it impressively outperforms a canonical genetic algorithm as well as two other enhanced GAs.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIS.1999.810230","startPage":"98","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Information Intelligence and Systems (Cat.

A new face synthesis method is implemented for reducing the false acceptance rate and enhancing the rejection capability of the classifier. The system is capable of recognizing a face in less than one second. The system is tested on the well-known ORL database. The system performance compares favorably with the state-of-the-art systems. In the case of the ORL database, a correct recognition rate of 99.5% at 0.5% rejection rate is achieved. This rate compares favorably with the rates achieved by other systems on the same database.

The chip is intended to be a part of a pipeline machine controlled by a general purpose processor. It could process 25512/spl times/512 pixel frames per second in one pixel per clock cycle rate. In real time application an array of this chip could be used, leading to a less expensive design than using an array of general DSP chips. The functionality of the chip is programmable by changing the flow of data between the internal units using a multiplexer and demultiplexer set. A 15-bit control register is used to set the flow path and consequently the operation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIS.1999.810346","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Information Intelligence and Systems (Cat.

Wavelet analysis, which processes information effectively at different scales, can be very useful in accomplishing this. One of the most critical issues to be solved in the application of wavelet analysis is to choose the correct filter types and filter parameters. If the threshold is too small or too large, the wavelet shrinkage estimator will tend to overfit or underfit the data. The threshold is often selected arbitrarily or by adopting certain theoretical or statistical criteria. Recently, new and versatile techniques have been introduced to solve that problem. In this study, we propose an integrated thresholding design of the optimal wavelet transform by genetic algorithms (GAs) to represent a significant signal that is most suitable in neural network models, especially for use in chaotic financial markets. The results show that a hybrid system using GAs has better performance than any other method.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIS.1999.810352","startPage":"586","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Information Intelligence and Systems (Cat.

Minimizing either formulation attracts cells sharing common signals (nets) together. The result is a placement with a great deal of overlap among the cells. To reduce cell overlap, the methodology iterates between global optimization and repartitioning of the placement area. In this work, we added new attractive and repulsive forces to the traditional formulation so that overlap among cells is diminished without repartitioning the placement area. The superiority of our approach stems from the fact that our new formulations are convex and no hard constraints are required.

In this paper, we explore power optimization with dual supply voltages under given timing constraints. By analyzing the relations among the timing slack, delay and power consumption in a given circuit, we relate the voltage-scaling power optimization to the maximal weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, which is polynomial-time solvable on a transitive graph. Then we develop a provably good lower-bound algorithm based on MWIS to generate the lower bound of the power consumption. Also, we propose a fast approach to predict the optimum supply voltages. The maximum power reduction is obtained by using a modified lower-bound algorithm with optimum voltages. Experimental results show that the resulting lower bound is tight for most circuits and that the estimated optimum supply voltage is exactly, or very close to, the best choice of actual voltages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/810625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6441902","conferenceDate":"7-11 Nov. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Provably good algorithm for low power consumption with dual supply voltages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provably good algorithm for low power consumption with dual supply voltages","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00810625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0385S","chronDate":"7-11 Nov. 1999","isNumber":"17544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6570","citationCount":"8","articleId":"810625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":810630,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbin Jiang","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yanbin Jiang","id":"37440346600"},{"name":"S.S.

The problem is NP-hard, and much work has been devoted to designing good heuristics and approximation algorithms; to date, the champion in solution quality among RST heuristics is the Batched Iterated 1-Steiner (BI1S) heuristic of Kahng and Robins (1992). In a recent development, exact RST algorithms have witnessed spectacular progress: the new release of the GeoSteiner code of Warme, Winter, and Zachariasen (1998) has average running time comparable to that of the fastest available Bl1S implementation, due to Robins. We are thus faced with the paradoxical situation that an exact algorithm for an NP-hard problem is competitive in speed with a state-of-the-art heuristic for the problem. The main contribution of this paper is a new RST heuristic, which has at its core a recent 3/2 approximation algorithm of Rajagopalan and Vazirani (1999) for the metric Steiner tree problem on quasi-bipartite graphs-these are graphs that do not contain edges connecting pairs of Steiner vertices. The RV algorithm is built around the linear programming relaxation of a sophisticated integer program formulation, called the bidirected cut relaxation. Our heuristic achieves a good running time by combining an efficient implementation of the RV algorithm with simple, but powerful geometric reductions. Experiments conducted on both random and real VLSI instances show that the new RST heuristic runs significantly faster than Robins' implementation of BI1S and than the GeoSteiner code. Moreover, the new heuristic typically gives higher-quality solutions than Bl1S.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1999.810641","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

ECO is difficult in two aspects: first, there are a large number of existing interconnects which become obstacles in the region. A hierarchical approach is not applicable in this situation, and we need to search a large, congested region thoroughly. Second, advances in circuit designs require variable width and variable spacing on interconnects. Thus, a gridless routing algorithm is needed. We propose to use an implicit representation of a non-uniform grid graph for a gridless maze routing algorithm. A novel slit-tree plus interval-tree data structure is developed, combined with a cache structure, to support efficient queries into the connection graph. Our experiments show that this data structure is very small in memory usage while very fast in answering maze expansion related queries. This makes the framework very useful in the ECO type of routing.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1999.810642","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

The independent stage includes logic operations such as decomposition, extraction, factoring, substitution and elimination. These operations are done with some kind of division (Boolean, algebraic), with the goal being to obtain a logically equivalent factored form which minimizes the number of literals. In this paper, we present an algorithm for factoring that uses graph partitioning rather than division. Central to our approach is to combine this with the use of special classes of Boolean functions, such as read-once functions, to devise new combinatorial algorithms for logic minimization.

We show that there are tight relationships between AP moments, circuit moments and central moments. The first order AP moment represents the Elmore delay while the higher order AP moments can be used to represent the error between the Elmore delay and the exact 50% delay from the view of gain and phase-shift variation. With the help of the physical meaning revealed by the AP moments, a closed-form 50% delay model-AP delay model is proposed for RLC interconnect delay estimation in terms of the first four AP moments. We also propose a new two-pole model (AP two-pole model) by matching the first two phase moments of the transfer function. The AP two-pole model can be used for more generally timing parameters estimation. The input signal's impact on delay estimation can be incorporated into these two delay models by simply combining the input signal's AP moments with the transfer function's AP moments.

We describe a general model which includes all previously considered models. Then we show how to optimize the cycle time and optimally balance slacks on data paths and on clocktree paths. The problem of finding a clock schedule with the optimum cycle time was solved before, either by linear programming or by binary search, using a test for negative circuits in a digraph as a subroutine. We show for the first time that a direct combinatorial algorithm solves this problem optimally. Incidentally, this yields a new efficient method for timing analysis with transparent latches. Moreover, we extend this algorithm to the slack balancing problem: To make the chip less sensitive to routing detours, process variations and manufacturing skew it is desirable to have as few critical paths as possible. We show how to find the clock schedule with minimum number of critical paths (optimum slack distribution) in a well-defined sense. Rather than fixed dock arrival times we show how to obtain as large as possible intervals for the clock arrival times. This can be considered as slack on clocktree paths. Indeed, we can find the global optimum of simultaneous optimization of slacks on all data paths and clocktree paths. All the above is done by very efficient network optimization algorithms, based on parametric shortest paths. Our computational results with recent IBM processor chips show that the number of critical paths decreases dramatically, in addition to a considerable improvement of the cycle time. The running times are reasonable even for the largest designs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1999.810654","startPage":"232","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

A novel formulation of clock skew scheduling as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem is introduced. The concept of a permissible range, or a valid interval, for the clock skew of each local data path is key to this QP approach. From a reliability perspective, the ideal clock schedule corresponds to each clock skew within the circuit being at the center of the respective permissible range. However, this ideal clock schedule is nor practically implementable because of limitations imposed by the connectivity among the registers within the circuit. To evaluate the reliability, a quadratic cost function is introduced as the Euclidean distance between the ideal schedule and a given practically feasible clock schedule. This cost function is the minimization objective of the described algorithms for the solution of the previously mentioned quadratic program. Furthermore, the work described here substantially differs from previous research in that it permits complete control over specific clock signal delays or skews within the circuit. Specifically, the algorithms described here can be employed to obtain results with explicitly specified target values of important clock delays/skews with a circuit, such as for example, the clock delays/skews for I/O registers. An additional benefit is a potential reduction in clock period of up to 10%. An efficient mathematical algorithm is derived for the solution of the QP problem with O(r/sup 3/) run time complexity and O(r/sup 2/) storage complexity, where r is the number of registers in the circuit. The algorithm is implemented as a C++ program and demonstrated on the ISCAS'89 suite of benchmark circuits as well as on a number of industrial circuits. The work described here yields additional insights into the correlation between circuit structure and circuit timing by characterizing the degree to which specific signal paths limit the overall performance and reliability of a circuit. This information is directly applicable to logic and architectural synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1999.810655","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

In this scenario, interfaces play a key role, since they allow one to control/exploit these interdependencies with the aim of meeting design constraints like power. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to explore this impact. We consider a whole system comprising a CPU, caches, a main memory and interfaces between those cores, and we demonstrate the high impact that an adequate adaptation between core parameters and interface parameters has in terms of power consumption. We find in particular that cache parameters and the configurations of cache buses have a significant impact in this respect. In addition, we make the important observation that optimizing for performance no longer implies that power is optimized as well in deep submicron technologies. Instead, we find that, especially for newer technologies, the relative interface power contribution increases, leading to scenarios where we obtain a real power/performance tradeoff. In summary, our explorations have revealed as yet uninvestigated interdependencies that represent the first step towards future efforts to optimize/adapt interfaces and caches in core-based systems for low-power designs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAD.1999.810660","pdfPath":"/iel5/6570/17544/00810660.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"273","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

The quality of the shutdown control algorithm (the power management policy) mostly depends on knowledge of the user's behavior, which in many cases is initially unknown or non-stationary. For this reason, DPM policies should be capable of adapting to changes in user behavior. In this paper, we present a novel DPM scheme based on idle period clustering and adaptive learning trees. We also provide a design guide for applying our technique to components with multiple sleep states. Experimental results show that our technique outperforms other advanced DPM schemes as well as simple time-out policies. The proposed approach shows little deviation of efficiency for various workloads having different characteristics, while other policies show that their efficiency changes drastically depending on the trace data characteristics. Furthermore, experimental evidence indicates that our workload learning algorithm is stable and has fast convergence.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.1999.810661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17544","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Recent studies, as well as experiments reported in this paper, show significant crosstalk effects in long on-chip interconnects of GHz DSM chips. Recognizing the importance of high-speed, reliable interconnects in GHz SOCs, we address in this paper the problem of testing for glitch and delay errors caused by crosstalk in buses and interconnects between components of a SOC. Since it is not possible to explicitly test for all the possible process variations and defects that can lead to crosstalk errors in SOC interconnects, we present an abstract model, Maximum Aggressor (MA) fault model, and its test requirements. The attractiveness of the model is that it can abstract crosstalk defects in interconnects with a linear number of faults, while the corresponding MA tests provide complete coverage for all level defects related to cross-coupling capacitance the interconnects. A SPICE-level fault simulation methodology is presented which allows simulation of a small subset of the potentially exponential number of defects. The simulation methodology also enables validation of the proposed fault model and the resulting test set.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

We propose a new synthesis methodology for synchronous systems that makes the design functionally insensitive to the latency of long wires. Given a synchronous specification of a design, we generate a functionally equivalent synchronous implementation that can tolerate arbitrary communication latency between latches. By using latches we can break a long wire in short segments which can be traversed while meeting a single clock cycle constraint. The overall goal is to obtain a design that is robust with respect to delays of long wires, in a shorter time by reducing the multiple iterations between logical and physical design, and with performance that is optimized with respect to the speed of the single components of the design. We describe the details of the proposed methodology as well as report on the latency insensitive design of PDLX, an out-of-order microprocessor with speculative-execution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology for correct-by-construction latency insensitive design","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design.

Due to the precedence and capacity constraints in TMFPGAs, the clustering and partitioning problems for TMFPGAs are different from the traditional ones. We propose a two-phase hierarchical approach to solve the partitioning problem for TMFPGAs. With the precedence and capacity considerations for both phases, the first phase clusters nodes to reduce the problem size, and the second phase applies a probability-based iterative improvement approach to minimize cut cost.

Schedule compression is an important step in partitioning for time-multiplexed FPGAs and can greatly influence the quality of the partitioning solution. We exactly solve the schedule compression problem by converting it to a constrained min-max path problem. We further extend our algorithm to minimize the communication cost during schedule compression.

Recovery of the source signal from the observed signal is achieved by modelling the source signal as a time-varying autoregressive process, the distortion operator by a IIR filter, and then using a Bayesian framework to estimate the parameters of the distorting filter, which can be used to deconvolve the observed signal. The paper also discusses how the non-stationary properties of the source signal allow the identification of the distortion operator to be uniquely determined.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.1999.810872","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics.

Long responses create a need for more rapidly converging algorithms in order to meet the specifications for network echo cancelers devised by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union). In general, faster convergence implies a higher sensitivity to near-end disturbances, especially \"double-talk\". Recently, a fast converging algorithm called proportionate NLMS (normalized least mean squares) algorithm (PNLMS) has been proposed. This algorithm exploits the sparseness of the echo path. In this paper we propose a method for making the PNLMS algorithm more robust against double-talk. The slower divergence rate of these robust algorithms in combination with a standard Geigel double-talk detector improves the performance of a network echo canceler considerably during double-talk. This results in the robust PNLMS algorithm which diverges much slower than PNLMS and standard NLMS. A generalization of the robust PNLMS algorithm to a robust proportionate affine projection algorithm (APA) is also presented. It converges very fast, and unlike PNLMS, is not as dependent on the assumption of a sparse echo path response. Trade off between convergence and divergence rate is easily tuned with one parameter and the added complexity is about 7 instructions per sample.","doi":"10.1109/ASPAA.1999.810888","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics.

The challenge to modem designers is to develop technology which improves the BWA return-on-investment (ROI), to wit: minimize the installed equipment (total system, not just modem) cost while maximizing the data-bearing capacity of millimeter-wave links. BWA links exhibit pathologies and cost models distinct from those of wired links, and these distinctions should be reflected in a well-designed BWA modem. This tutorial paper discusses BWA ROI within the context of a system-level cost concept relates this model to primary LMDS link pathologies, and suggests several modem-level features which will be required to address BWA ROI challenges. A few specific modem design approaches are noted to demonstrate that these BWA design challenges are readily addressable.","doi":"10.1109/RAWCON.1999.810917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAWCON.1999.810917","startPage":"3","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"RAWCON 99. 1999 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

In particular, the capacity of a code division multiple access system is optimized for high traffic concentrated areas by using an active power control approach. As a simulation example of this approach, an optimized system is first considered with even distribution of traffic. The system is then perturbed with unevenly distributed cellular traffic arising due to the congestion on some of the freeways. Adjustments are made to the transmit powers for the cell sites of interest and the capacity is re-optimized for the changed traffic conditions. This results in a dramatic improvement both in terms of capacity and quality of service compared to the case when the system is not re-optimized for the changed traffic conditions i.e., using the static solution currently in practice. The results are presented for the capacity and quality levels achieved using the dynamic approach of the paper.","doi":"10.1109/RAWCON.1999.810939","publicationTitle":"RAWCON 99. 1999 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

In the past, implementation complexity slowed the development of OFDM for useful commercial and handheld applications. With the advances in semiconductor processing technology and digital signal processing, OFDM is now practical for system solutions including wireless LANs, audio and television broadcasting, and land mobile services. We describe the application of OFDM within software defined radio (SDR) platforms to provide multi-service land mobile radio capabilities. The simple combination of OFDM and SDR provides great flexibility in system configuration, significant reduction in product development cycle time, and very high potential for software reuse.","doi":"10.1109/RAWCON.1999.810944","publicationTitle":"RAWCON 99. 1999 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

This linearizer compensates the gain and phase nonlinearity of the power amplifier at the same time by controlling both variable attenuator and phase shifter with the feedback of only the difference signal between the input and output envelopes. Also a new way to achieve signal cancellation is presented with the combination of a minimization circuit, log detector and vector modulator. A two-tone test for a class-A power amplifier at 1.855 GHz with a frequency spacing of 1 MHz showed an IMD reduction of 16 dB maximum and stable operation over 5 dB output power variation up to 4 dB back-off. The proposed linearizer is also applicable to class-AB and class-B power amplifiers without any special adjustments. The adaptation algorithm is fully implemented with analog ICs, which can further extend its applicability with the integration technology.","doi":"10.1109/RAWCON.1999.810970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAWCON.1999.810970","startPage":"223","endPage":"226","displayPublicationTitle":"RAWCON 99. 1999 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

Both drain voltages of a two stage monolithic GaAs IC power amplifier are modulated with respect to the input RF signal using a high efficiency class-S modulator. The class-S modulator is implemented as a silicon IC consisting of a high-speed comparator and driver circuitry to supply currents in excess of 1 A. The RF amplifier IC utilizes two GaAs HEMT devices designed for class A/B operation. An envelope-feedback loop provides equalization of time delay differences between the envelope and RF signal paths as well as amplitude linearization. The resulting transmitter has adequate bandwidth to amplify an IS-136 /spl pi//4 DQPSK signal with required spectral linearity achieving 49% total efficiency at 1-W average output power using a 3.5 volt supply. At 10 dB power back-off, the system efficiency remains above 30%. Targeting low cost portable wireless handsets, the complete amplifier is realized using two integrated circuits with minimal off chip components.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/810990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6558751","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"800 MHz power amplifier using envelope following technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"800 MHz power amplifier using envelope following technique","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00810990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032736S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6585","citationCount":"21","articleId":"810990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":810992,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

Trade-offs among instruction-window size, branch-prediction accuracy, and instruction- and data-cache size can change as these parameters move through different domains. For example, modeling unrealistic caches can under- or overstate the benefits of better prediction or a larger instruction window. Avoiding such pitfalls requires understanding how all these parameters interact. Because such methodological mistakes are common, this paper provides a comprehensive set of SimpleScalar simulation results from SPECint95 programs, showing the interactions among these major structures. In addition to presenting this database of simulation results, major mechanisms driving the observed trade-offs are described. The paper also considers appropriate simulation techniques when sampling full-length runs with the SPEC reference inputs. In particular, the results show that branch mispredictions limit the benefits of larger instruction windows, that better branch prediction and better instruction cache behavior have synergistic effects, and that the benefits of larger instruction windows and larger data caches trade off and have overlapping effects. In addition, simulations of only 50 million instructions can yield representative results if these short windows are carefully selected.","doi":"10.1109/12.811115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17608/00811115.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.811115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Branch prediction, instruction-window size, and cache size: performance trade-offs and simulation techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Tellurium","Out of order","Delay","Sampling methods","Computer science","Senior members","Databases","Microarchitecture","Marine vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","cache storage","digital simulation","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["branch prediction","instruction-window size","cache size","performance tradeoffs","simulation techniques","decoupling buffers","branch-prediction accuracy","SimpleScalar simulation","SPECint95 programs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Branch prediction, instruction-window size, and cache size: performance trade-offs and simulation techniques","volume":"48","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6464216","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811115/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Branch prediction, instruction-window size, and cache size: performance trade-offs and simulation techniques","sourcePdf":"00811115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087143S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"62","articleId":"811115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":811188,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper we propose a new optimistic concurrency control protocol called OCC-DATI. In OCC-DATI the number of transaction restarts is minimized by dynamic adjustment of the serialization order of the conflicting transactions. The need for dynamic adjustment of the serialization order is checked and the serialization order is updated in the validation phase. This provides more freedom to adjust the serialization order of conflicting transactions. OCC-DATI has several advantages over other optimistic concurrency control protocols. The protocol maintains all the nice properties with forward validation, a high degree of concurrency freedom front deadlock, and early detection and resolution of conflicts, resulting in both fewer wasted resources and a smaller number of restarts. All of these are important to the performance of RTDBSs and contribute to greater chances of meeting transaction deadlines. Performance studies of our protocol have been carried out in RTDBS and the results confirm that the performance of the OCC-DATI is better than other well-known OCC protocols.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Concurrency control","Real time systems","Database systems","System recovery","Transaction databases","Optimization methods","Computer science","Concurrent computing","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","real-time systems","transaction processing","protocols","database management systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic serialization order adjustment","time-stamp intervals","real-time databases","optimistic concurrency control protocol","OCC-DATI","transaction restarts","conflicting transactions","validation phase","concurrency freedom front deadlock","early conflict resolution","early conflict detection","performance","transaction deadlines"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RTCSA.1999.811188","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications.

In this paper, we first adapt the optimistic concurrency control with forward validation to the broadcast environments. The adapted protocol gives autonomy between the mobile clients and the server such that the mobile clients can read consistent data off the air without contacting the server. However, it suffers from excessive transaction restart that affects the timeliness of mobile transactions. Therefore, we propose a new protocol based on timestamp ordering that can show significant performance improvement. The timestamp ordering technique enjoys a number of benefits from flexible adjustment of serialization order by exploiting the semantics of read-only transactions, which comprise most of the existing applications.

The main idea is to associate each discrete transition in a timed automaton with a task (an executable program). Intuitively, a discrete transition in an extended timed automaton denotes an event releasing a task and the guard on the transition specifies all the possible arrival times of the event (instead of the so-called minimal inter-arrival time). This yields a general model for hard real-time systems in which tasks may be periodic or non-periodic. We show that the schedulability problem for the extended model can be transformed into a reachability problem for standard timed automata, and thus it is decidable. This allows us to apply model-checking tools for timed automata to schedulability analysis for event-driven systems. In addition, based on the same model of a system, we may use the tools to verify other properties of the system (e.g. safety and functionality). This unifies schedulability analysis and formal verification in one framework. We present an example where the model-checker UPPAAL is applied to check the schedulability and safety properties of a control program for a turning lathe.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=811218","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications.

Special attention is given to the computational aspects of the approach and several methods to improve the computational efficiency are described.","doi":"10.1109/91.811241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/17610/00811241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.811241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17610","startPage":"713","endPage":"722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piecewise quadratic stability of fuzzy systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=811241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Piecewise quadratic stability of fuzzy systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811241/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6466486","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piecewise quadratic stability of fuzzy systems","sourcePdf":"00811241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039686S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"631","articleId":"811241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":811247,"authors":[{"name":"Yon-Sik Hong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sangji University, Wonju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yon-Sik Hong","id":"37087703040"},{"name":"Hyunsoo Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Seoul City University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyunsoo Jin","id":"37087704331"},{"name":"Chong-Kug Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chong-Kug Park","id":"37087390804"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"811247","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=811247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Fuzzy neural networks","Traffic control","Fuels","Road vehicles","Delay effects","Cost function","Fuzzy logic","Lighting control","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic control","signalling","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrosensitive traffic light","traffic light","fuzzy neural network","efficiency","fuzzy logic","spill back","vehicle waiting time","optimal traffic signal cycle"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.811247","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/17610/00811247.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"759","endPage":"767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.811247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"new electrosensitive traffic light using fuzzy neural network","abstract":"In the past, when there were few vehicles on the roads, the time-of-day (TOD) traffic signal worked very well. The TOD signal operates on a preset signal-cycling scheme independent of traffic conditions. It cycles on the basis of the number of average passenger cars to the memory device of an electric signal unit. Today, with the increasing traffic and congested roads, the conventional traffic light creates start-up delay time and end-lag time. A 30 to 45% efficiency in traffic handling is lost, as well as added fuel costs, since it is not optimized for today's traffic condition. To solve this problem, an electrosensitive traffic light using neural fuzzy logic is investigated. This scheme uses an electrosensitive traffic light control, which changes signal based on the passing vehicle's weight, length, and passing area. Through computer simulation, this method has been proven to be much more efficient than fixed time interval signal since the average waiting time, average vehicle speed, and fuel consumption will be improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811247/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6466490","volume":"7","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"new electrosensitive traffic light using fuzzy neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"new electrosensitive traffic light using fuzzy neural network","sourcePdf":"00811247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030783S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"7","articleId":"811247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":811260,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The development closely follows the seminal work of Taylor and Cootes on active shape models, but is based on a hierarchical parametric object description rather than a point distribution model. The segmentation system includes both the building of statistical models and the automatic segmentation of new image data sets via a restricted elastic deformation of shape models. Geometric models are derived from a sample set of image data which have been segmented by experts. The surfaces of these binary objects are converted into parametric surface representations, which are normalized to get an invariant object-centered coordinate system. Surface representations are expanded into series of spherical harmonics which provide parametric descriptions of object shapes. It is shown that invariant object surface parametrization provides a good approximation to automatically determine object homology in terms of sets of corresponding sets of surface points. Gray-level information near object boundaries is represented by 1-D intensity profiles normal to the surface. Considering automatic segmentation of brain structures as their driving application, the authors' choice of coordinates for object alignment was the well-accepted stereotactic coordinate system. Major variation of object shapes around the mean shape, also referred to as shape eigenmodes, are calculated in shape parameter space rather than the feature space of point coordinates. Segmentation makes use of the object shape statistics by restricting possible elastic deformations into the range of the training shapes. The mean shapes are initialized in a new data set by specifying the landmarks of the stereotactic coordinate system. The model elastically deforms, driven by the displacement forces across the object's surface, which are generated by matching local intensity profiles. Elastical deformations are limited by setting bounds for the maximum variations in eigenmode space. The technique has been applied to automatically segment left and right hippocampus, thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus from volumetric magnetic resonance scans taken from schizophrenia studies. The results have been validated by comparison of automatic segmentation with the results obtained by interactive expert segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/42.811260","startPage":"828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17611/00811260.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.811260","endPage":"839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic model-based segmentation of 3-D neuroradiological data sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Elastic model-based segmentation of 3-D neuroradiological data sets","volume":"18","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6470547","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","pubMedId":"10628943","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic model-based segmentation of 3-D neuroradiological data sets","sourcePdf":"00811260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047362S","chronDate":"Oct.  1999","isNumber":"17611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"292","articleId":"811260","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":811261,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In addition, the concept of a decision deadline is introduced which then leads to an extension of the primary and backup checking routines. The thus modified checking routines are shown to achieve a lower rejection ratio for right task deadlines and constrained scheduler execution times than the modification making use of task slack suggested S.

The energy efficiency of systems-on-a-chip (SOC) could be much improved if one were to vary the supply voltage dynamically at run time. We developed the design methodology for the low-power core-based real-time SOC based on dynamically variable voltage hardware. The key challenge is to develop effective scheduling techniques that treat voltage as a variable to be determined, in addition to the conventional task scheduling and allocation. Our synthesis technique also addresses the selection of the processor core and the determination of the instruction and data cache size and configuration so as to fully exploit dynamically variable voltage hardware, which results in significantly lower power consumption for a set of target applications than existing techniques. The highlight of the proposed approach is the nonpreemptive scheduling heuristic, which results in solutions very close to optimal ones for many test cases. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a variety of modern industrial strength multimedia and communication applications.","doi":"10.1109/43.811318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17612/00811318.pdf","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.811318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power optimization of variable-voltage core-based systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811318/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Power optimization of variable-voltage core-based systems","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6462097","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power optimization of variable-voltage core-based systems","sourcePdf":"00811318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092596S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"127","articleId":"811318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":811326,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The fault simulation method is based on characterizing the standard cell library with SPICE, using transistor charge equations for the site of the open, using logic simulation for the rest of the circuit, taking four different factors that can affect the voltage of an open into account, and considering the potential oscillation and sequential behavior of interconnect opens.

Some studies of Internet traffic have reported seeing occasional packet reordering events and ascribed these events to \"route fluttering\", router \"pauses\" or simply to broken equipment. We have found, however, that parallelism in Internet components and links is causing packet reordering under normal operation and that the incidence of packet reordering appears to be substantially higher than previously reported. More importantly, we observe that in the presence of massive packet reordering transmission control protocol (TCP) performance can be profoundly effected. Perhaps the most disturbing observation about TCP's behavior is that large scale and largely random reordering on the part of the network can lead to self-reinforcingly poor performance from TCP.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet reordering is not pathological network behavior","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.811445","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17613/00811445.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.811445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=811445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Packet reordering is not pathological network behavior","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6466468","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet reordering is not pathological network behavior","sourcePdf":"00811445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034942S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"248","articleId":"811445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":811450,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In order to effectively utilize a broadcast medium for such a service, it is necessary to have efficient on-line scheduling algorithms that can balance individual and overall performance and can scale in terms of data set sizes, client populations, and broadcast bandwidth. We propose an algorithm, called R/spl times/W, that provides good performance across all of these criteria and can be tuned to trade off average and worst-case waiting time. Unlike previous work on low overhead scheduling, the algorithm does not use estimates of the access probabilities of items, but rather, it makes scheduling decisions based on the current queue state, allowing it to easily adapt to changes in the intensity and distribution of the workload. We demonstrate the performance advantages of the algorithm under a range of scenarios using a simulation model and present analytical results that describe the intrinsic behavior of the algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811450/","volume":"7","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6466473","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"R/spl times/W: a scheduling approach for large-scale on-demand data broadcast","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R/spl times/W: a scheduling approach for large-scale on-demand data broadcast","sourcePdf":"00811450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055037S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"201","articleId":"811450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":811451,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

For short or bursty connections, a selected route must have the required resources to ensure appropriate communication with regard to desired quality-of-service (QoS). For example, in ATM networks, the route setup process considers only links with sufficient resources and reserves these resources while it advances toward the destination. The same concern for QoS routing appears in datagram networks such as the Internet, when applications with QoS requirements need to reserve resources along pinned routes. In this paper, we analyze the performance of multi-path routing algorithms and compare them to single-path reservation that might be persistent, i.e., retry after a failure. The analysis assumes that the routing process reserves resources while it advances toward the destination, thus there is a penalty associated with a reservation that cannot be used. Our analysis shows that while multi-path reservation algorithms perform comparably to single-path reservation algorithms, either persistent or not, the connection-establishment time for multi-path reservation is significantly lower. Thus, multi-path reservation becomes an attractive alternative for interactive applications such as World Wide Web browsing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of multi-path routing","doi":"10.1109/90.811453","endPage":"896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17613/00811453.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","startPage":"885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.811453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=811453","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance analysis","Read only memory","IP networks","Failure analysis","Web sites","Delay effects","Quality of service","ISDN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","telecommunication network routing","quality of service","asynchronous transfer mode"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-path routing","connection-oriented networks","resource reservations","short connections","bursty connections","quality-of-service","ATM","route setup process","QoS routing","datagram networks","Internet","pinned routes","performance","multi-path reservation","connection-establishment time","World Wide Web browsing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of multi-path routing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6466475","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of multi-path routing","sourcePdf":"00811453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045283S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"151","articleId":"811453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":811456,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Kousa","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Kousa","id":"37275197000"},{"name":"A.K.

In a typical fiber optic CDMA communication system, the received optical pulse sequence is correlated with the stored address in the decoder. The signal processing operations can be performed on an incoherent or a coherent basis. In incoherent optical CDMA, the phases of the pulse sequences are not important, and they are summed on the basis of power rather than electric field. A relatively low autocorrelation peak, when the network is multiple-accessed, and cross correlation of other users, lowers the signal-to-noise ratio and increases bit error rate. In coherent CDMA, we still has the same basic network and temporal (envelop) pattern for the impulse responses as in incoherent CDMA but now in the optical correlation process the pulses are summed up coherently. Coherent CDMA has potential advantages from the point of view of power budget, side lobes, and signal-to-noise ratio. There are substantial practical difficulties when we try to implement it due to the environmental influence. We proposed a novel receiver system, the conventional incoherent matched filter followed by post signal processing block, where signal processing is performed coherently.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOPR.1999.811542","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

It turned out that the performance of such systems is primarily limited by three factors: the fast growth of Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE), the pattern effect and the nonlinear impulse-phase distortions in SOA which are caused by the low saturation energy of SOA, the gain recovery time comparable with the bit period and by the strong nonlinearity of SOA. The effects are also important in other systems where cascaded SOA are used, for example, as optical gates. With increasing bit rate in TDM systems and with number of channels in WDM, the effects became stronger and the maximum propagation distances decrease. So in the case of a 4/spl times/10 Gbit/s WDM system a 80 km transmission has been experimentally demonstrated and up to 200 km predicted from numerical simulations. The limiting effects and consequently the performance are similar in systems with both NRZ or RZ modulation formats. But using other modulation formats like Phase Shift Keying (PSK) or Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK), where the signal power is constant, it would be possible to avoid these specific for SOA, harmful effects and to approach the performance in the 1.5 /spl mu/m window. In this paper we present the results on a single channel 10 Gbit/s Differential Binary PSK - Direct Detection (DBPSK-DD) transmission in a 1.3 /spl mu/m system with in-line MQW-SOA amplifiers. The format has been chosen because of simplicity of the transmitter and receiver designs.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOPR.1999.811546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOPR.1999.811546","startPage":"513","endPage":"514 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

An embedded computing system uses microprocessors to implement parts of the functionality of non-general-purpose computers. Early microprocessor-based design courses, based on simple microprocessors, emphasized input and output (I/O). Modern high-performance embedded processors are capable of a great deal of computation in addition to I/O tasks. Taking advantage of this capability requires a knowledge of fundamental concepts in the analysis and design of concurrent computing systems. We believe that next-generation courses in embedded computing should move away from the discussion of components and toward the discussion of analysis and design of systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/811598/","volume":"88","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6473980","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Embedded systems education for the future","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded systems education for the future","sourcePdf":"00811598.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"61","articleId":"811598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":811605,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The arm control part controls joint angles of the arm according to the position of the operator's wrist joint measured by a 3D position sensor. The hand and wrist control part selects an active joint out of four joint degrees of freedom and controls if using an impedance model based on the EMG signals. A distinctive feature of our method is to use a statistical neural network for EMG pattern discrimination. This network can adapt to changes of the EMG patterns according to differences among individuals different locations of the electrodes, time variation caused by fatigue or sweat, and so on. It is shown from the experiments that the hand and wrist motions can be controlled based on the EMG signals sufficiently. It may be useful as an assistive device for a handicapped person.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1999.811705","startPage":"1586","endPage":"1591 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The adaptation unit learns the relation between EMG and control command and adapts operator's characteristics. The trainer unit makes the adaptation unit learn in real-time. Experiments show that the proposed controller discriminates ten forearm motions, which contain four wrist motions and six hand motions, and learns within 4/spl sim/25 minutes.

It is inspired by motion planning research and incrementally builds a roadmap that represents the connectivity of the free configuration space, as it senses the physical environment. We present some experimental results with our sensor-based planner running on this real test-bed. The robot is started in completely unknown and cluttered environments. Typically, the planner is able to reach (planning as it senses) the goal configuration in about 7-25 scans (depending on the scene complexity), while avoiding collisions with the obstacles throughout.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The latter are encrypted as chaotic fluctuations of the wavelength of a tunable semiconductor laser driven by a generator of chaos. Decoding makes use of another generator of chaos operating as a local oscillator synchronized on the first one. The first results are reported in the wavelength range of 1550 nm. We report a specific implementation of a high dimensional chaotic system for optically encoded communications. It is achieved with a delayed feedback chaotic generator, which is known to produce high dimensional chaos. Since there is no rigorous analysis for synchronization of delay-differential equations, we used a way different from Pecora and Carroll (1991). Another originality of the method is that the method is based on chaos in wavelength, in contrast with previous systems which make use of chaos in intensity. The advantage is that the chaotic regime can be controlled very easily using a nonlinearity in wavelength rather than in power.","doi":"10.1109/LEOS.1999.811788","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE LEOS Annual Meeting Conference Proceedings.

Recently, this technology has been applied to wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) networks, and resulted in advances in several network elements, including switches, filters, and modulators. For future WDM networks with enormous transmission capacity, optical switching for optical-layer crossconnects is of particular interest due to its transparency to steady advances in the per-channel bit-rate. In this paper, we review various micromachined optical-switching technologies, focusing on the free-space MEMS optical switch we have demonstrated and recent progress. We also show the unique features of this technology in implementing important network functions in integrated form, such as bridging in network restoration and maintenance, integrated signal-monitoring, connection-path verification, and network connection-symmetry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MEMS for free-space optical switching","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE LEOS Annual Meeting Conference Proceedings.

An optoelectronic FPGA demonstrator along these lines is currently being realised.

However, the necessary increase of the sample rate that goes with the interpolation is not feasible in most RF applications. Therefore a time-variant implementation of CIC-filters is presented which circumvents the high intermediate sample rate. This time-variant implementation results in a linear periodically time-variant system (LPTV) which is completely equivalent to its original linear time-invariant system (LTI) consisting of the interpolator and the decimator. Thus well-known methods of system analysis can be used by analysing the LTI system, while implementing the system as an LPTV system, avoiding the high intermediate sample rates of the LTI system. The advantage of CIC-filters not having stored the coefficients of the impulse response but rather the description of the impulse response, enabling an implementation which is independent of the interpolation- as well as the decimation-factor, is preserved with the LPTV system. In contrast to Lagrange interpolators cancelling only the image components of the interpolated signal, time-variant CIC-filters also cancel the aliasing components, which is important in applications, where antialiasing is more important than anti-imaging.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1999.812224","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

Extended experiments carried out in a test-bed of 6406 face images, have shown that the face detection accuracy is increased significantly when non-linear and probabilistic illumination equalizers pre-process the sub-images. Moreover, better results can be achieved in case of training the neural detector using positional and orientation normalized face examples. In this case the neural face detector has the capability to locate both position and orientation of a face.

In particular the combination with logic synthesis tools allows a significant acceleration of the design cycle. Further advantages are the use of top down design methodology, reuse of code and retargeting to different semiconductor technologies. Nevertheless there is a lot of effort spent in developing tools and languages, which allow a higher level of abstraction and by this a further improvement of the design efficiency. This paper focuses on application specific code generation tools, which might be used in many areas of digital hardware design. The concept is validated on the example of parameterized Forward Error Correction (FEC) circuits, which are used for error detection or correction in most communication systems. The code generators are able to generate the synthesizable VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuits Hardware Description Language) description of complete FEC encoders and decoders within less than a second.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.812263","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

It has been shown that the MRHF have the inherent property that on smooth areas they provide good noise attenuation whereas on changing areas the noise attenuation is traded for a good response to the change. Moreover, they act in small window and few number of operations, resulting in simple and fast filter structures. We present in this paper a hardware implementation of the MRHF which exploits in an effective way the features and the robustness of both median filters and rational filters. This architecture is suitable for the use in real time due to its reduced hardware complexity in applications where size and cost are of critical significance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/812265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6544257","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of the median-rational hybrid filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of the median-rational hybrid filters","confLoc":"Paphos, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"00812265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046868S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6565","articleId":"812265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":812268,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The algorithm is based on the correlation introduced by the cyclic prefix, which is exploited in the time domain where both time and frequency offset are estimated simultaneously. The synchronization unit also performs frequency correction, which means that no feedback to the analog parts is necessary. Although the algorithm is too complex to be implemented on today's most powerful standard DSP, a hardware architecture that is optimized for the algorithm can be implemented with moderate complexity. The unit contains 32 kbit RAM and 5000 gates and the sample rate is 25 Msamples/s.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

It is shown that it is possible to encode codewords into fundamental algorithms such as digital filters and the DFT in such a way that proof of authorship may be determined. Silicon technology has now advanced to the point that there is a serious mismatch in the time taken to design such systems and the time to market for any new product or product derivative. The answer may well be that designers and differing companies will have to share sub systems (virtual cores) between themselves to reduce design time to acceptable levels. To this end all the major players formed the Virtual Socket Interface Alliance in March 1997. The protection of IP becomes a serious issue if such intercompany sub system design exchange becomes more commonplace. The protection of IP via watermarking techniques will have to be applied at all levels of design, but if such techniques are applied at basic algorithm level, then they will become very difficult to detect at lower levels of system design.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.812301","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

Although currently it can only compute optimal solutions for small-sized instances, this algorithm makes it possible for researchers to compare heuristic solutions against optimal solutions for small-sized instances. Our min-min and max-min heuristics have also been shown to be good heuristic algorithms for computing hexagonal Steiner minimum trees, but not as good as the iterated I-Steiner heuristic. We have previously designed a linear time algorithm for computing an optimal layout of a minimum spanning tree, which can be viewed as a fast approximation to hexagonal Steiner minimum trees.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.812302","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

Specifically, the efficiency of the presented FDBSS method is studied on a TITO (two input, two output) network. In extensive experiments in an artificially created environment using real-room impulse responses, the mean SIR resulting from the output decorrelation was increased by approximately 8 dB. Furthermore, a percentage phoneme recognition improvement of 85% and 116% for each one of the separated speech signals compared to the mixed signals was measured. It is also shown that the complexity of the FDBSS method is significantly lower than in the time domain and for M-order linear separating filters is O(MlogM) compared to the O(M/sup 2/) in the time domain.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.812314","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

This new filter adopts an active feedback amplifier topology in order to provide higher selectivity. Also, an alternative filter synthesis is derived from this topology for the conventional lumped and transversal filter. In order to demonstrate its usefulness, a L-band active filter is designed at GSM1800 center frequency 1.8 GHz with 30 MHz 3 dB bandwidth and evaluated in terms of computer simulation. These simulated results demonstrate that the proposed filter architecture has superior performance when compared with the traditional lumped and transversal filter.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1999.812331","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

This allows a drastic acceleration of the simulation of continuous-time CNNs.

The EMG signal contains information about the operator's intended motion as well as the force level of the muscles and may be suitable as an input signal for a new interface tool. This paper proposes an EMG controlled painting device using a neural network and develops a prototype system. In the proposed device, an operator's intended direction of the pointer is estimated using the finite number of base directions which are set on the computer display. The neural network has to estimate the probability that the pointer will move to each base direction, so that the heavy learning calculation and the huge network structure are not neccessary. Through experiments, it is shown that the direction and the velocity of the pointer movement can be controlled by using the EMG signals.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812377","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17543/00812377.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"68 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

First, we define the hypergame situation, in which each agent is assumed to have only internal model of the situation. Then, we develop adaptation process model of the groups, and a simulation of the process. In the model, the genetic algorithm has role to improve population of perceptions according to the past experiences.

It is generally hard to obtain any optimal solution in this problem domain with more than two machines, whereas with exactly two machines, the optimal is given by Johnson's algorithm. The impressive points revealed by the implementation of various instances of the reinforcement learning formulations are as follows. First, a good formulation may sometimes lead an agent to acquire the optimal rule that minimizes an objective function. Secondly, an agent can learn and obtain the improved schedules even when the formulation is not perfect. Thirdly, the same formulation is sound not only for the two-machine problem, but for the three-machine problem where Johnson's algorithm does not necessarily give any optimal solution. Consequently, the utilization of the reinforcement learning has potential to help us find an approximate solution or sometimes the optimal solution in a relatively simple way. The capability of a reinforcement learning agent, however, mostly depends upon the problem formulation. It is devised by utilizing theoretical solution methods and heuristics. At the same time, the agent has great flexibility to obtain improved schedules under the formulation with less prior knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812460","startPage":"534","endPage":"539 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The proposed neural network approach consists of two modules: one for real-time collision-free motion planning, the other for real-time fine control of the robot manipulators. The motion planning module is a biologically inspired, parallel connected, topologically organised neural network, where each neuron is characterised by a shunting equation, whose state space is the robot configuration joint space. This module is capable of planning a real-time optimal path for robot manipulators through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network. The motion control module involves of a feedforward neural network together with a traditional PD feedback loop. It is capable of achieving real-time fine motion control of robot manipulators under significant uncertainties and without any prior knowledge of the robot dynamics. This module can quickly compensate sudden changes in the robot dynamics. The real-time fine control of robot manipulators is achieved through the online learning of the neural network.

Advantages of both NNs and GP are combined in the proposed method. Identification of unknown/uncertain robot manipulators is realized by using the adaptation ability of NNs, and the architecture of the NNs is evolved by using the GP technique. Consequently, evolution of the NN architecture and adaptation of its weights are carried out in the proposed method. In the proposed GP, the architecture of each individual in the population is the same as a NN. The adaptation process of each NN (each individual in the population) to the unknown/uncertain robot manipulator is carried out using the back-propagation learning algorithm during the fitness evaluation process of each NN in GP. Therefore, the NN, which shows better adaptation to the unknown/uncertain robot manipulator, results in better fitness in the proposed method. In order to avoid frequent disruption of the important subtree of the NN caused by crossover operators, the worst subtree of one selected NN is replaced with the best subtree of the other NN. The back-propagated errors during the adaptation process are used for evaluation of the subtrees of each NN. This strategy makes the evolution of NN architecture more efficient than traditional GP. The effectiveness of the proposed identification method has been evaluated with a 2DOF planar robot manipulator.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812509","startPage":"802","endPage":"806 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

But they are often regarded as black boxes as the interpretation of their inner working is quite difficult. Researchers have been developing algorithms that extract rules from neural network models and can allow one to explain the decision process of the network. Sparse architectures and structured models are easy to analyse. In this work an algorithm for extraction of rules from an artificial neural model for solving pattern classification problems, capable of handling real life vague information expressed by linguistic variables, has been devised. A sparse structured architecture of fractally connected feedforward multilayered neural networks has been used and its efficiency in rule extraction compared to the fully connected network has been studied. The ease of rule extraction by the proposed sparse fractal network compared to full connection network has been proved by simulation with two data sets.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.812523","startPage":"869","endPage":"874 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The algorithm is based on a cooperative model for genetic operators in GA.

(ii) CM (crossover and mutation) to promote the increase of beneficial mutations in the population. SRM applies qualitative mutation only to the bits inside a mutation block and controls the required exploration-exploitation balance through its adaptive mechanism. An extinctive selection mechanism subjects SRMs' and CMs' offspring to competition for survival. The simulation results show that our scheme reduces computer memory and processing time required to obtain high quality halftone images. For example, compared to the conventional halftoning technique with GA, the proposed algorithm using only a 2% population size required about 15% evaluations to generate similar quality images.

A new concept of the exoskeleton type master-arm is introduced. Basically, this master-arm is composed of serial links. To provide maximum range of human motion, several redundant joints are added to the serial links. Intensive graphic simulation was performed to get the optimal design parameters. In order to reduce the number of necessary joint measurement, kinematics of serial links was carefully considered in design. Three measurable, controllable joints and three free redundant joints were used for shoulder axis similar to wrist axis while one measurable, controllable axis was used for the elbow joint. For force feedback, the electric break constraints the joint movement so that the operator can feel the same force as the slave robot does. Calibration algorithm was derived to compensate the variation of the kinematic parameters. The master-arm can be used for teleoperation with a slave robot, or as a motion planner for an industrial robot.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/812553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6513644","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A new master-arm for man-machine interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new master-arm for man-machine interface","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00812553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034591S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"2","articleId":"812553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":812561,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.R.

Switch matrices were introduced to route signals going from one channel to another inside the FPGA chips. We extend the switch matrix architecture proposed by Zhu et al. (1993) to route nets between FPGA chips in a multi-FPGA system. Given a limited number of routing resources in the form of programmable connection points within the two-dimensional switch matrix, this problem examines the issue of how to route a given net traffic through the switch matrix structure. First we formulate the problem as a general undirected graph in which each vertex has one single color. Since there can be at most six colors in the entire graph, the problem is defined as a search for at most six independent vertex sets of each color in the graph. We propose an exact solution for this problem that is suitable only for small size switch matrices. For large size switch matrices used in multi-FPGA systems, we convert the graph-theoretic formulation to a constraint satisfaction problem. Due to its large size, we then model the constraint satisfaction problem as a 0-1 multi-dimensional knapsack problem for which a fast approximate solution is applied. Experiments were conducted on switch matrixes of various sizes to measure the performance of the proposed approximate solution. The results show that the performance of our proposed heuristic improves with the increasing size of the switch matrixes.","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.2000.812616","publicationTitle":"VLSI Design 2000.

Using a simple architecture, the proposed method can be implemented as a special purpose VLSI chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"VLSI Design 2000. Wireless and Digital Imaging in the Millennium.

Built-in self-test methodology for testing individual cores is assumed, and sharing of test resources (pattern generators and signature registers) among cores is permitted. We consider a scenario where the system integrator is dealing with \"soft\" or \"firm cores\" for which the final realization has not been frozen and the flexibility of module selection rests with the integrator. We argue that advantage can be taken of this flexibility in coming up with a power-constrained test plan. Since scheduling of test sessions also affects power dissipation in a crucial way, we present an algorithm for simultaneous module selection and test scheduling. Our objective is to minimize the test application time treating the test area overhead and total power dissipation as constraints. We report the results of our implementation of a test planner on two examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICVD.2000.812650","publicationTitle":"VLSI Design 2000. Wireless and Digital Imaging in the Millennium.

Our technique fills a gap in existing techniques for system-level performance analysis, which are either too slow to use in an iterative communication architecture design framework (e.g., simulation of the complete system), or are not accurate enough to drive the design of the communication architecture (e.g., techniques that perform a \"static\" analysis of the system performance). Our technique is based on a hybrid, trace-based performance analysis methodology where an initial co-simulation of the system is performed with the communication described in an abstract manner (e.g., as events or abstract data transfers). An abstract set of traces are extracted from the initial co-simulation that contain necessary and sufficient information about the computations and communications of the system components. The system designer then specifies a communication architecture by selecting a topology consisting of dedicated as well as shared communication channels (shared buses) interconnected by bridges, mapping the abstract communications to paths in the communication architecture, and finally customizing the protocol used for each channel. The traces extracted in the initial step are represented as a communication analysis graph (CAG), and an analysis of the CAG provides an estimate of the system performance, as well as various statistics about the components and their communication. Experimental results indicate that our performance analysis technique achieves accuracy comparable to complete system simulation (an average error of 1.91%), while being over two orders of magnitude faster.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of systems with multi-channel communication architectures","publicationTitle":"VLSI Design 2000.

Flash memory has attractive features such as non-volatility and fast I/O speed, but it also suffers from an inability to update in place, and limited usage cycles. These drawbacks require many changes to conventional storage (file) management techniques. Our focus is on lowering the cleaning cost and evenly utilizing flash memory cells while maintaining a balance between these two often-conflicting goals. The cleaning efficiency is enhanced by dynamically separating cold data and non-cold data. The second goal, cycle leveling, is achieved to the degree where the maximum difference between erase cycles is below the error range of the hardware. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a significant benefit over naive methods: a maximum of 35% reduction in the cleaning cost with evenly-spread writes across segments.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00812717.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Instead, the goal of our control scheme is to make the interaction with a robot manipulator safe by making the robots actions predictable and understandable to the human operator. At the same time the forces the robot applies with any part of its body to its environment have to be controllable and limited.

As yet the application of virtual reality to cooperation and conflict resolution between multiple robots has received little attention. In the paper, an event-driven virtual reality system for two robots is proposed and implemented. This system uses a standard VR package to implement the environment, thus allowing easier development of tasks, skills and behaviours. The assemblies in the virtual scene, i.e. CAD counterparts of these two robots, act like an outer protective skin to events from the variable environment around them such as collisions. Thus the corresponding safety actions can then be taken. The virtual and real environments are physically connected through a LAN using the TCP/IP protocol. Once the virtual assemblies are placed in safe and desirable goal locations, the real links update their locations using recorded trajectory points through path planning and collision avoidance. This approach prevents the VR from causing collisions between two real links, and between the real links and their environment. This system has provided a useful extension to current virtual reality systems for single robots. Also this system has application potential in multiple robot teleoperation tasks.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=812836","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

In this definition, the uniformity volume has 16 points in the space. The uniformity of the chamber is mathematically expressed in terms of both electric field amplitude and angle in this paper. Both parameters are used to define the criterion for uniformity evaluation. A three-dimensional reverberation chamber model is presented based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique that is used to analyse the uniformity of reverberation chambers. The simulation reveals that the maximum deviations of max, min, and mean of electric field amplitude are about 3 to 4 dB and grouped angle deviation is about 3% in the case we studied.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatability.

The conventional modeling of these losses in the solution of the multiconductor transmission line (MTL) equations via the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) method makes use of the representation of this internal impedance of the conductors of the form A+B/spl radic/s/spl rlhar2/A+B/spl radic/j/spl omega/ where s is the Laplace transform variable and /spl omega/ is the radian frequency of excitation. The validity of this representation assumes that the high-frequency resistance and internal inductive reactance are equal which, it turns out, is not the case for conductors of rectangular cross section. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the representation A+B/spl radic/s in itself produces errors even if the assumption of equality of the high-frequency resistance and internal inductive reactance were true. The contribution of this paper is to provide an improved method for modeling this high-frequency loss in the time domain that overcomes the above two deficiencies and is suitable for the finite-difference, time-domain solution of the MTL equations. In addition, we show some typical crosstalk calculations with the new representation to determine whether the above differences are significant.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.1999.812943","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatability.

This paper improves the performance of these planners by using the medial axis of the workspace to guide the random sampling. At a preprocessing stage, the medial axis of the workspace is computed using a recent efficient algorithm. Then the flexible object is fitted at random points along the medial axis. The energy of all generated configurations is minimized and the planner proceeds to connect them with low-energy quasi-static paths in a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space. Given an initial and a final configuration, the planner connects these to the roadmap and searches the roadmap for a path. Our experimental results show that the new sampling scheme is successful in identifying critical deformations of the object along solution paths which results in a significant reduction of the computation time. Our work on planning for flexible objects has applications in industrial settings, virtual reality environments, and medicine.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic roadmap planner for flexible objects with a workspace medial-axis-based sampling approach","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Since the desired position and force required to perform certain tasks are usually designated in the operational space, the control force vector should be given to the end-effector in the operational space. However, friction of each joint of a robot manipulator impedes control accuracy. Therefore, friction should be effectively compensated for in order to realize precise control of robot manipulators. The fuzzy-neuro approach, a combination of fuzzy reasoning and neural networks, has been playing an important role in the control of robots. Applying the fuzzy-neuro approach, learning/adaptation ability and human knowledge can be incorporated into a robot controller. We propose an effective robot manipulator fuzzy-neuro position/force control method in which joint friction is effectively compensated for using adaptive friction models. The effectiveness of the proposed control method was evaluated by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1999.813045","pdfPath":"/iel5/6568/17600/00813045.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"453 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

We first have been interested in image based visual servoing approach and recently we have focused our attention in position based visual servoing approach. In this paper, our goal is to study how we can introduce 3D visual features in a closed robot control loop. We consider a camera mounted on the end effector of the manipulator robot to estimate the pose of the target object; The required positioning task is to reach a specific pose between the sensor frame and a target object frame. Knowing the target object model, we can localize the object in the 3D visual sensor frame and estimate the pose between the camera and the target object at each iteration. To perform the visual servoing task, we use a nonlinear state feedback. We propose a new exact model for parametrization of the pose (position and the orientation of the frame object in the sensor frame). The main advantage of this approach is that camera translation and camera rotation are separately controlled due to use of a particular choice of frames. Convergence and stability have been proved theoretically, and the tests in simulation and on our experimental site show good behaviour using this type of approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Construction of this kind of application involves an important task of design and development in order to represent and to manipulate process data and behaviour at different degrees of abstraction for interfacing with data acquisition systems connected to the process. This is an open problem that becomes more complex with the number of variables, parameters and relations to account for the complexity of the process. Multiple specialised modules tuned to solve simpler tasks that operate under a co-ordination provide a solution. A modular architecture based on concepts of software agents, taking advantage of the integration of diverse knowledge-based techniques, is proposed for this purpose.

Secondly, we analyze the structure of minimal subsets and its probability properties in a digital image, and we improved the probability of primitive detection by reducing the invalid parts. Thirdly, we mention the subpixel measurement technique that makes edge location highly accurate, thereby increasing the accuracy of primitives by replacing the minimal subset with their subpixels. Finally, we present a method to simultaneously detect several primitives using the equivalence genes which are regarded as the set of points on a primitive; it has some excellent functions such as observation of convergence, promotion of convergence, confirmation of convergence and maintenance of multiple subpopulations.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.1999.813091","startPage":"931","endPage":"940 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1999 7th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

The GA algorithm utilizes a new chromosome representation, which takes into account machine and worker assignments to jobs. A study was conducted, using the proposed scheduling method to compare the performance of six dispatching rules with respect to eight performance measures for two different shop characteristics: i) dual-resources (machines and workers) constrained shop, and ii) single-resource constrained shop (machines only). An example is used for illustration. The results indicate that the dispatching rule which works best for a single-resource constrained shop is not necessarily the best rule for a dual-resources constrained system. Furthermore, it is shown that the most suitable dispatching rule depends on the selected performance criteria and the characteristics of the manufacturing system.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.1999.813116","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1139 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1999 7th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

Manufacturing devices or systems are usually controlled by programmable controllers (PCs). In order to satisfy the requirements of downsizing and hidden information, we develop a novel type of controller which is implemented using the field programmable gate array (FPGA) as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The widely used programming language in the area of sequential control, Ladder Diagram (LD), is also implemented on such a FPGA. The main bottleneck of the implementation is how to realize cyclic scan, which is the most significant characteristic of PCs. We describe two methods to implement the cyclic scan. One involves using the clock event of the Very High Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (VHDL), and the other is of translating a coil as a self-hold circuit of LD into an appropriate flip-flop element of VHDL. We also compare the two methods and show the benefits of the new controller implemented by FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/ETFA.1999.813150","publicationTitle":"1999 7th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation.

It has the advantages of compact structure and small chip size. In order to further realize the asymmetric template coefficients with negative values, the coupling MOS resistor is replaced by a fully programmable stage containing two lateral PNP bipolar junction transistors and two MOS switches. The proposed symmetric /spl nu/BJT CNN and fully programmable /spl nu/BJT CNN with single neighborhood layer r=1 have been successfully applied to noise removal, hole filling, connected component detection, and shadowing creation. Moreover, the proposed /spl nu/BJT CNN can be easily extended to realize the multi-layer neighborhood structure. Thus the proposed /spl nu/BJT CNN has great potential in the VLSI implementation of neural networks.

However, since optical receivers consist of several blocks such as preamplifier, wideband amplifiers, variable gain amplifier and decision circuit, NF can be a useful tool to determine the noise characteristics of the whole optical receiver. In this paper, NF of a TIA (preamplifier) is described by using g/sub m/ and the bandwidth to cut-off frequency ratio B/f/sub T/, showing that NF of TIA degrades quadratically with increasing bandwidth. With a given technology and the noise specification of the whole optical receiver, the maximum achievable bandwidth is obtained, facilitating the design of the TIA. As an example, a common-source TIA was designed and simulated with 0.6 /spl mu/m AMS CMOS technology, showing a close match with the predicted results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Preamplifiers","Optical noise","Optical receivers","Noise measurement","Circuit noise","Noise figure","Broadband amplifiers","CMOS technology","Semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit noise","preamplifiers","optical receivers","wideband amplifiers","equivalent circuits","network analysis","integrated circuit design","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","network synthesis","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-noise preamplifiers","giga-hertz bandwidth preamplifiers","optical receiver applications","LNA design","noise characteristics","transimpedance amplifier","noise figure","noise specification","common-source configuration","AMS CMOS technology","0.6 micron","1.5 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.813226","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

The advantages of high frequencies, i.e. millimeter wave devices, are obvious: high bandwidths enable high data rates in communication applications and a high resolution in sensor systems with the benefit of small size antennas. It is expected that by the use of monolithic solutions for the front-end components, the cost targets of mass markets can be met. Most promising seems a silicon based solution as the wafer sizes (up to 12 inch) and the high availability of silicon substrates favours a cost effective mass production. In this paper we give an overview on our approach to provide the front-end components with emphasis on the generation of millimeter wave frequencies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1998.813269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17620","startPage":"51","endPage":"54 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

This approach presents many advantages and some drawbacks. In fact, simply connecting together more of these chips, it allows one to implement any size CNN arrays with the possibility to modify the network topology. On the other hand, it requires a high number of pads for the interconnections. Moreover, some parasitic capacitors due to the pads and the PCB wiring will appear. In this paper a high performance technique to improve the interconnection strategy able to overcome these drawbacks without any lack of functionality is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1998.813301","startPage":"195","endPage":"198 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

Compared to linear filters, nonlinear predictors allow one to model a greater variety of signal characteristics, e.g., chaotic behavior and limit cycles. Nonlinear predictors require a suitable adaptation algorithm that is able to work in nonstationary environments. To this end genetic algorithms are proposed for the on-line adaptation of non-linear predictors. The methodology is applied to the problem of nonlinear and nonstationary signal estimation by using the adaptive predictor as part of a nonlinear prediction error filter. Experimental results for measured fire signals demonstrate the excellent adaptation properties of the genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1998.813305","startPage":"209","endPage":"212 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

The implementation of the digitized PID algorithm in one FPGA (field Programmable Gate Array) is designed as a specialized computation processor. This FPGA PID circuit can be embedded into a process calculator (PLC, Microcomputer, and microprocessor board...). This hardware implementation can be implemented in three different architectures: serial, parallel or mixed. In all cases this kind of electronic implementation has a much faster response than a software one. The digital PID so designed is based essentially in architectures including state machines, multipliers, adders and some others logic circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

The sliding mode controller shows much better tracking performance with faster dynamics, no steady-state errors, flatter passband response, due to the intrinsic \"Just In Time\" (JIT) switching operation, step response without overshoot due to the third-order Bessel control polynomial, and short circuit proof operation. Test results confirm that the sliding mode controller exceeds the performance of existing sigma delta controllers.

It is therefore important to minimise the area of the synapses; however, it requires a high transistor count to implement a synapse circuit which has a good linearity over a wide operating range. The area of the synapse circuits can be reduced by employing a very simple three transistor circuit, but this is achieved at the cost of a loss of linearity of the synaptic multipliers. This paper presents an investigation of the impact of synapse nonlinearity on the learning power of the network. In some cases learning performance is severely compromised. A novel modification to the synapse circuits is suggested that is capable of alleviating the problems caused by synapse nonlinearity.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.813406","pdfPath":"/iel5/6565/17601/00813406.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1020 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of encoding phase information on RZ optical pulses to be subsequently decoded in a DPSK demodulator, and as such we christen the term RZDPSK to describe this format. Direct comparison with NRZ signaling and constant intensity DPSK reveals an improvement of about 1 dB in receiver sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/LEOS.1999.813561","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE LEOS Annual Meeting Conference Proceedings.

We survey the technology involved, and argue that these systems will become increasingly inadequate for large populations of mobile users where frequent roaming is involved. We present two micropayment schemes which permit a caller to inject a payment stream into the network which allows multiple network operators and value-added service providers to be paid in real time. The methods support dynamic pricing by the association of a pricing contract with the call which specifies the cost for each leg of the call route. The system will alleviate problems of mobile fraud, eliminate the need for interoperator billing agreements, and simplify payment for value-added network services. We discuss the relative merits of the two systems described and the characteristics of the prototype implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/813822/","volume":"6","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6469728","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Flexible real-time payment methods for mobile communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible real-time payment methods for mobile communications","sourcePdf":"00813822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044658S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"9","articleId":"813822","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":813928,"authors":[{"name":"I-Hung Khoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"I-Hung Khoo","id":"37086972593"},{"name":"H.C.

A simple diode varactor circuit is adopted for center frequency tuning. These improved circuits reduce the power dissipation of the amplifier. HSPICE simulation has been extensively performed to verify the performance of the designed amplifier. The results show a gain of 26 dB at Q=30 under 2 V power supply with 35 mW power dissipation. The noise figure is 5 dB in the passband. The tunable frequency range is between 950 MHz and 1050 MHz. The gain variation is less than 4 dB in the range of 0/spl deg/C to 80/spl deg/C.

The critical issue in the IR receiver is the phase accuracy and magnitude balance of the 90/spl deg/ phase shifting network. The proposed IR receiver employs a 3rd order IIR switched-capacitor (SC) quasi-Hilbert filter to act as a broad band 90/spl deg/ phase shifter. This SC phase shifter generates only 0.1/spl deg/ phase error and has a capacitor-ratio insensitive magnitude response.

In the new device structure, the parasitic PNP bipolar junction transistor in the CMOS process is used to implement the neuron whereas the spreading base resistor array is used to realize the synapse weights for various neuron inputs. The multi-emitter structure can also be used to generate the multi-out neuron response. The vBJT neuron cell has the advantages of compact structure and small chip size. The vBJT neuron cell has been successfully applied to the implementation of the analog Hamming neural network. The analog Hamming network can store many sets of examplar patterns with different gray levels. Moreover, the input patterns can be weighted or scaled to eliminate the common offsets and increase the dynamic range and the processing flexibility. With simple and compact structure and high integration capability, the proposed vBJT has a great potential in the VLSI implementation of neural network.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

Based on the framework, we construct an input variable selection mechanism for a neural network (NN) controller for the cart pole control in the sensor-motor space. In the internal representation space, a decision tree is constructed by ID3, which is used for the input variable selection. The specifications of the NN controller and the learning mechanism of the NN controller, evolutionary programming (EP), are determined by using genetic algorithm (GA) incorporating the knowledge extracted by ID3. These three search algorithms are streamlined in the framework for easy tuning by the designer.

Its potentials have been investigated mainly from the point of view of storage capacity and recalling ability. But, most of them are direct extensions of well-known autocorrelation type associative memory on real-valued networks. This paper discusses a method for synthesizing associative memories in complex-valued neural networks. The method guarantees that all the desired memories are successfully stored and correctly recalled in the sense that they all become asymptotically stable equilibrium points. In order to enhance the capability of implementing associative memories, we propose a new network architecture of complex-valued neural networks in which dynamic neurons and static neurons are fully connected. We also propose a learning method for synthesis of associative memories by using static networks for the purpose of efficient learning. The proposed learning algorithm makes it possible to realize specified asymptotically stable equilibria in the complex-valued neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814124/","accessionNumber":"6498275","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of associative memories using complex-valued neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of associative memories using complex-valued neural networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00814124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037165S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","articleId":"814124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":814129,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The basic concept of the DDA is that the elite of offspring will alter the nearest parent individual in multi parental GA. In other words, the DDA is an alternation scheme utilizing distance information between individuals. Further, we extend this concept to multiple individual alternation, called distance dependent multiple alternation (DDMA). Classifying offspring according to nearby parent, and generation alternation is taken place in each group. Thus multiple alternation will occur at the same time in each cluster. It improves GA performance in its computation times. We compared the performance of the proposed alternation model with the minimal generation gap (MGG) model proposed by (Satoh et al., 1996) in several functional optimization problems with the multi-parental unimodal normal distribution crossover (UNDX-m) that shows good performance as a crossover operator for the real-coded GA. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed alternation model in maintaining diversity of populations robustly and in improving performance on the real-coded GA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814163/","accessionNumber":"6498316","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A distance alternation model on real-coded genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distance alternation model on real-coded genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00814163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092713S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"1","articleId":"814163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":814164,"authors":[{"name":"K.

EC is generally a time-consuming paradigm because it needs much trial and error. To accelerate ECs, some modification methods of the genetic operator have been proposed such as improving mutation and recombination of chromosomes and/or their control parameters, and so on. Through these modifications, ECs can find the suboptimal solutions in the early generations. In spite of these improvements, ECs still require much time to obtain the solution in many practical engineering applications. Fitness evaluation usually spends most of the computational time. This paper presents a new approach for the acceleration of ECs by reducing the time for fitness evaluation. Saving the time for fitness evaluation results in accelerating the ECs in the time domain. In the proposed method, only one individual of the population is actually evaluated in each generation. Fitness values for the rest of the population are estimated with simple calculation. Although the errors of estimation may decelerate the ECs in the generation domain, the time saving in the evaluation scheme exceeds the deceleration. As a result, we can obtain suboptimal solutions relatively faster. The simulation results of the designed fuzzy logic controller using GA show the effectiveness of the proposed method to accelerate evolution in the time domain. The simulation results applied to De Jong's (1975) Test Function show the applicability to various problems of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.814167","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Some new categories of genetic codes are defined, such as uniform code, bias code, tri-sector code and symmetric codes, etc, and they are applied in some problem optimizations and a robotic problem solution. These codes have found their application in developing some special and powerful genetic algorithms. For example, based on symmetric code theory, new genetic strategy, GASC: Genetic Algorithm with Symmetric Code, is developed. In the paper, some key definitions on encoding are given out, such as living-block, dead-block, link, fix-link, living-population, as well as some operations on genetic, such as bit-transposition, bit-and, population-and, member-and, etc. Some of our research shows that genetic encoding techniques have a very important influence on the performance of genetic algorithms. The convergence speed of genetic algorithms with some specially developed codes will be much faster than conventional genetic algorithms. That is very significant for finding more applications of genetic algorithms, as, in many cases, genetic algorithm applications are limited by their convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814168/","accessionNumber":"6498313","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms encoding study and a sufficient convergence condition of GAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms encoding study and a sufficient convergence condition of GAs","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00814168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041607S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"6","articleId":"814168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":814175,"authors":[{"name":"T.

DGAs are extended algorithms of GAs that can be performed in parallel. In DGAs, the total population of genes is divided into subpopulations called islands. In each island, a simple GA is performed and some of the individuals in each island are moved to another island after a certain migration interval. The number of genes in the DGA is determined by the migration rate. Although DGAs can find optimum solutions even when there are several peaks in objective functions, they require more parameters than simple GAs and are therefore more time intensive. We describe a new DGA in which the migration rate is randomized (DGA/rmr). This algorithm is evaluated using two numerical simulations: the Rastrigin function and the Rosenbrock function. We show that optimal parameters exist in these systems and obtain solutions with the proposed approach. The solutions are not optimal, but are better than those obtained using a DGA with fixed migration rate. DGA/rmr may therefore be a less time intensive alternative to conventional DGAs.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.814175","startPage":"689","endPage":"694 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for the wavelength assignment in WDM rings that minimize overall network cost. The network cost includes the cost of the transceivers required at the nodes as well as the number of wavelengths. By the design of a genetic structure, the evaluation of fitness, the selection of parents, and the operation of reproduction, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the GA approach when comparing with a class of the existing heuristic strategies. To achieve better performance, the relationships both the cost distribution and the number of generation are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814230/","accessionNumber":"6505907","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Traffic grooming in WDM networks using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic grooming in WDM networks using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00814230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025028S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"2","articleId":"814230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":814239,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The processor design is then automatically synthesized into a detailed RTL-level structural model in VHDL, along with an estimate of its area. The system also generates the corresponding detailed machine description and instruction format description that can be used to retarget a compiler and an assembler respectively.

The fault model is then used to derive a probability (likelihood) that, during the lifetime of the system, faults will not arrive faster than this maximum rate.

For low-quality time varying channels, channel coding alone often cannot ensure this and the employment of automatic repeat requests (ARQ) is unavoidable. For achieving high efficiency, a combination of both channel coding and ARQ, also referred to as hybrid ARQ (HARQ), is preferable. Using turbo codes (TC)-the most powerful of known error-correcting codes-in HARQ transmission schemes results in very efficient transmission systems, which maintain a high throughput over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels even for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as E/sub s//N/sub 0/=-2 dB. The aim of this article is to construct a turbo hybrid ARQ (THAQ) system of type II, which guarantees a high throughput at extremely low SNRs, where other known THARQ systems suffer from rapid throughput degradation.","doi":"10.1109/ITNW.1999.814358","publicationTitle":"1999 Information Theory and Networking Workshop (Cat.

The first step in this estimation is code acquisition. Its purpose is to get a rough estimate for the delay, which then would be further processed to achieve better accuracy. In this paper we propose a subspace code acquisition algorithm which is based on recently reported minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) methods for blind multiuser detection and pilot-aided synchronization. More precisely, a set of fictitious pilot signals is generated by the former, and used for synchronization purposes by the latter. Moreover, the finite alphabet property is exploited by assuming that the source signals are binary. Comparison is made with the traditional matched filter (MF), Constrained Minimum Output Error (CMOE) detector and MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) method by simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

It is assumed that the desired downlink user sends the training sequence, which is utilized in the code acquisition in the uplink. The methods are based on quite similar optimization criteria as that of the interference suppressing MMSE demodulator. Using the training signal, the performance can be greatly improved without increasing computational complexity. Simulations show that the methods outperform, e.g. CMOE method, maximum likelihood method, eigenvector-based MUSIC, and matched filter.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.814405","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

It features high throughput/area efficiency and high block size flexibility for a small hardware complexity. This circuit concurrently processes different block sizes, N/2/spl times/N/2 and N/spl times/N, permitting for the Advanced Prediction (AP) option of the H.263/MPEG-4 standards. It is fully parametrizable in terms of block (N) and search area (p) sizes thus allowing for QCIF/CIF/4CIF image format processing. This architecture was implemented on a 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technology in order to realize two IP macro-cells to be integrated in single-chip H.263/MPEG coders. The cases of 30 frames/s CIF and 4CIF formats with a search area of -16/+15 were considered. The resulting CIF-format ASIC features a core area of 1.5 mm/sup 2/ for a clock frequency of 72 MHz while the 4CIF-format ASIC is characterized by a core area of 3.84 mm/sup 2/ for a clock frequency of 105 MHz.","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

The cost of such vehicles is generally high and therefore, safety, defined as the ability of being able to physically retrieve the AUV if an emergency situation arises, should be one of the main concerns in the design of such systems. We propose a hardware architecture, based on the field bus Controller Area Network (CAN), that specifically addresses the safety issues by using a special node which monitors the potentially hazardous situations in the underwater vehicle and reacts accordingly. The design of such node is vital and therefore internal redundancy is added to prevent a nondetected internal error from jeopardizing the safety of the system. The safety of the system is increased at a marginal cost by having the critical functions which relate to the retrieval of the AUV in a single node made of Components Off The Shelf (COTS).","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.814451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1999.814451","startPage":"1487","endPage":"1490 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

Thus, a receiver architecture using the sub-sampling principle to downconvert the signal can be now considered as a promising alternative to other kinds of architectures. In effect, sub-sampling systems are potentially more compact and more efficient, because the A/D converter is closer the antenna. In this paper, we show how it is possible to use switched-capacitor techniques to make a track-and-hold mixer and an AGC in the same circuit. This circuit is destined for the front-end of a receiver. For the basic configuration of the circuit, measurements have shown that a signal around 900 MHz could be demodulated to low frequency. An IIP3 of 19 dBm has been proved and at the same time, unfortunately, a noise figure of 20 dBm has been obtained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Radio frequency","Switching circuits","Switched capacitor circuits","Noise figure","Noise measurement","Antenna measurements","Frequency measurement","Band pass filters","Circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixers (circuits)","automatic gain control","signal sampling","switched capacitor networks","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","radio receivers","demodulators","UHF integrated circuits","integrated circuit noise","jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["track/hold-AGC circuit","downconversion","subsampling","receiver architecture","A/D converter","switched-capacitor techniques","track/hold mixer","demodulation","noise figure","ADC","SC techniques","RF receiver","CMOS chip","direct conversion","900 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1999.814461","publicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

The decoder circuit complexities are analyzed in terms of size and power based on 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS standard cell technology.

First, a limited but characteristic amount of frames are extracted from each video scene, able to provide an efficient representation of the video content. For this reason, a cross correlation criterion is mini-cited using a genetic algorithm. Low level features are extracted to indicate the frame characteristics, such as color and motion segments. After the key frame extraction, the video queries are implemented directly on this small number of frames. To reduce, however, the limitation of low-level features, the human is considered as a part of the process, meaning that he/she is able to assign a degree of appropriateness for each retrieved image of the system and then restart the searching. A feedforward neural network structure is proposed as a parametric distance for the retrieval, mainly due to the highly nonlinear capabilities. An adaptation mechanism is also proposed for updating the network weights, each time a new image selection is performed by the user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814514/","accessionNumber":"6572470","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relevance feedback for content-based retrieval in video databases: a neural network approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relevance feedback for content-based retrieval in video databases: a neural network approach","confLoc":"Paphos, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"00814514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046716S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6565","citationCount":"1","articleId":"814514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":814531,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Stable distributions are among the most important non-Gaussian models. Minimum noise power, minimum variance distortionless signal response (MNPDR, MVDR) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamformers are widely used to estimate the signals in Gaussian noise environments. In this paper, we present a beamforming technique for additive symmetric /spl alpha/-stable (S/spl alpha/S) noise environments. This new technique uses FLOS to formulate a nonlinear cost function which is then minimised to get an optimum weight vector for the array of sensors while the gain in the desired look direction is constrained to be unity. As this nonlinear constrained optimisation problem doesn't have a closed form solution, we use a gradient-based algorithm to estimate the weight vectors. This new algorithm is computationally efficient and can be used with a wide range of stable noise models.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.1999.814531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17615","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1758 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECS'99.

Approximating the /spl alpha/-stable noise by Gaussian mixture enables us to use the Bayesian techniques to derive a posterior probability density for DOA and frequency parameters from the signal and noise models. This posterior probability is then used in the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to derive samples for the DOA and frequency parameters.

Unlike previous optimal algorithms, these algorithms are cache oblivious: no variables dependent on hardware parameters, such as cache size and cache-line length, need to be tuned to achieve optimality. Nevertheless, these algorithms use an optimal amount of work and move data optimally among multiple levels of cache. For a cache with size Z and cache-line length L where Z=/spl Omega/(L/sup 2/) the number of cache misses for an m/spl times/n matrix transpose is /spl Theta/(1+mn/L). The number of cache misses for either an n-point FFT or the sorting of n numbers is /spl Theta/(1+(n/L)(1+log/sub Z/n)). We also give an /spl Theta/(mnp)-work algorithm to multiply an m/spl times/n matrix by an n/spl times/p matrix that incurs /spl Theta/(1+(mn+np+mp)/L+mnp/L/spl radic/Z) cache faults. We introduce an \"ideal-cache\" model to analyze our algorithms. We prove that an optimal cache-oblivious algorithm designed for two levels of memory is also optimal for multiple levels and that the assumption of optimal replacement in the ideal-cache model. Can be simulated efficiently by LRU replacement. We also provide preliminary empirical results on the effectiveness of cache-oblivious algorithms in practice.","doi":"10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814600","publicationTitle":"40th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

We also obtain the following classical result: any unbounded error probabilistic Turing machine running in space s that allows algebraic probabilities and algebraic cut-point can be simulated by a space O(s) ordinarily probabilistic Turing machine with cut-point 1/2.

(1999) showed that while this language is accepted by a deterministic finite automaton of size O(n), any one-way quantum finite automaton (QFA) for it has size 2/sup /spl Omega/(n/logn)/. This was based on the fact that the evolution of a QFA is required to be reversible. When arbitrary intermediate measurements are allowed, this intuition breaks down. Nonetheless, we show a 2/sup /spl Omega/(n)/ lower bound for such QFA for L/sub n/, thus also improving the previous bound. The improved bound is obtained from simple entropy arguments based on A.S. Holevo's (1973) theorem. This method also allows us to obtain an asymptotically optimal (1-H(p))n bound for the dense quantum codes (random access codes) introduced by A. Ambainis et al. We then turn to Holevo's theorem, and show that in typical situations, it may be replaced by a tighter and more transparent in-probability bound.","doi":"10.1109/SFFCS.1999.814608","publicationTitle":"40th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Cat.

Two central ideas in most of our results are cost scaling and greedy improvement. We present a simple greedy local search algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio of 2.414+/spl epsiv/ in O/spl tilde/(n/sup 2///spl epsiv/) time. This also yields a bicriteria approximation tradeoff of (1+/spl gamma/, 1+2//spl gamma/) for facility cost versus service cost which is better than previously known tradeoffs and close to the best possible. Combining greedy improvement and cost scaling with a recent primal dual algorithm for facility location due to K. Jain and V. Vazirani (1999), we get an approximation ratio of 1.853 in O/spl tilde/(n/sup 3/) time. This is already very close to the approximation guarantee of the best known algorithm which is LP-based. Further combined with the best known LP-based algorithm for facility location, we get a very slight improvement in the approximation factor for facility location, achieving 1.728. We present improved approximation algorithms for capacitated facility location and a variant. We also present a 4-approximation for the k-median problem, using similar ideas, building on the 6-approximation of Jain and Vazirani.

The emphasis of the article is on highlighting the issues involved both from an algorithmic standpoint as well as from a DSP standpoint.

We give an overview of DSPs and highlight the salient features that make them especially well-suited for wireless applications. We describe MPEG-4 simple profile video coding noting that in order to facilitate interoperability, it is important that wireless devices use standardized compression algorithms. We discuss our implementation of the MPEG-4 simple profile video codec on Texas Instruments' TMS320C54x DSP and discuss the issues involved. We highlight some general and application-specific DSP instructions on the TMS320C54x DSP that enable us to implement the core operations in the video coder efficiently, often in a single cycle, with minimal control overhead. We describe the performance of MPEG-4 video compression for a variety of content and formats. We give a description of channel coding with the H.223 standard. Then, we describe several channel coding experiments using both unequal and equal protection on MPEG-4 video sent through a simulated GSM channel. Unequal error protection, which ensures fewer errors in the important portions of the MPEG-4 video bitstream, provides improved quality when compared to equal error protection under harsh error conditions.","doi":"10.1109/79.814645","startPage":"36","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/17636/00814645.pdf","endPage":"53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/79.814645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814645/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless MPEG-4 video communication on DSP chips","volume":"17","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6481145","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless MPEG-4 video communication on DSP chips","sourcePdf":"00814645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046821S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"32","articleId":"814645","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":814654,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Dynamic thermal ratings offer a way to increase capacity under most weather- and load conditions while reducing the risk of failure under unfavorable conditions. EPRl's Dynamic Thermal Circuit Rating (DTCR) system makes thermal information readily available and provides a solid basis for higher equipment utilization. DTCR calculates dynamic thermal ratings (real-time ampacities) of power equipment based on actual load and weather conditions that are generally accessed through the utility's SCADA/EMS system. Given series or parallel combinations of equipment, the software determines dynamic circuit ratings by evaluating all equipment ratings on a circuit and finding the most limiting ampacity for each rating scenario. Dynamic ratings offer two key benefits over traditional static ratings: (1) higher loading of equipment is usually possible using actual measured load and weather parameters; traditional static ratings are overly conservative, since they are based on worst-case weather and load assumptions; and (2) a better understanding of equipment thermal response is achieved. This results in increased reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6502374","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic thermal ratings realize circuit load limits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic thermal ratings realize circuit load limits","sourcePdf":"00814665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072405S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17638","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"47","articleId":"814665","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":814714,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It has previously been shown that the weighted multistage PIC can be seen as an implementation of the steepest descent algorithm used to minimize the mean squared error (MSE). Following this interpretation, a unique set of weights, based on the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, was found to lead to the minimum achievable MSE for a given number of stages in a short-code system. In this paper, we introduce a method for finding an appropriate set of time-invariant weights for systems using long codes. The weights are dependent on moments of the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix, exact expressions of which can be derived. This set of weights is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the ensemble averaged MSE over all code-sets. The loss incurred by averaging rather than using the optimal, time-varying weights is practically negligible, since the eigenvalues of sample correlation matrices are tightly clustered in most cases of interest. The complexity required for computing the weights increases linearly with the number of users but is independent of the processing gain, hence on-line weight updating is possible in a dynamic system. Simulation results show that a few stages is usually sufficient for near-MMSE performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear parallel interference cancellation in long-code CDMA multiuser detection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.814805","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17644/00814805.pdf","startPage":"2074","endPage":"2081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.814805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=814805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Linear parallel interference cancellation in long-code CDMA multiuser detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6470747","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear parallel interference cancellation in long-code CDMA multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"00814805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051629S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"61","articleId":"814805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":814808,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

With two stages of parallel interference cancellation, a code-spread system with a load only slightly less than 1 bit/chip can obtain a bit error rate very close to that of a single-user system.","doi":"10.1109/49.814815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17644/00814815.pdf","startPage":"2090","endPage":"2095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.814815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-spread CDMA with interference cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Code-spread CDMA with interference cancellation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6470749","volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-spread CDMA with interference cancellation","sourcePdf":"00814815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049884S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"25","articleId":"814815","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":814816,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) is a natural multiple-access strategy for multiple data-rate systems. Previous work on multirate DS-CDMA receivers has focused on signal-processing techniques, which detect all users of all rates simultaneously. In the current work, multirate users have multiple bandwidths. Thus, it is proposed to exploit bandwidth differences to achieve frequency-based rate separation followed by single-rate detection schemes. Such a methodology enables a tradeoff between receiver complexity and performance. The performance of the proposed filters and receivers are derived for both a modified matched filter and modified decorrelator employing rate separation. The performance of a multirate CDMA overlay system is evaluated. In addition, chip pulse shaping for wide-band users is developed to improve performance for narrow-band users for the overlay system.","doi":"10.1109/49.814822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17644/00814822.pdf","startPage":"2096","endPage":"2109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.814822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of receiver filters for multiple chip-rate DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=814822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814822/","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of receiver filters for multiple chip-rate DS-CDMA systems","volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6470750","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of receiver filters for multiple chip-rate DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00814822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062273S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"10","articleId":"814822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":814823,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

In this paper, the bank of matched filters is replaced by a bank of adaptive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) filters as the generator of sufficient statistics. This formal replacement of the MF bank by the adaptive MMSE filter bank has significant conceptual consequences and provides improvement by several performance measures. The adaptive MMSE-ML receiver's digital implementation is significantly computationally simplified. The advantages of the proposed adaptive MMSE-ML receiver over the MF-ML receiver are: (1) ability to perform joint synchronization, channel parameter estimation, and signal detection where the signal is sent over an unknown, slowly time-varying, frequency-selective multipath fading channel; (2) increased information capacity in a multicellular environment; and (3) significantly improved bit error rate (BER) performance in a multicellular mobile communications environment. The information capacity and the BER of the proposed MMSE-ML receiver are analyzed.

Unfortunately, a high performance is associated with large transmission delays, prohibiting an application for speech transmission. Hence, the aim of this paper is the comparison of turbo codes employing short interleavers with convolutional codes in terms of bit error rate performance and computational effort. Additionally, a pragmatic approach of bandwidth-efficient turbo-coded modulation is considered. Analyzing the structure of the transmitter and receiver, interesting results are presented concerning the design of the mapper. Furthermore, a new very simple soft-output demodulation algorithm is derived. In order to compare turbo codes with convolutional codes under realistic conditions, both are embedded in a direct sequence (DS) code division multiple access system. Besides this comparison, a compromise between a high coding gain (low code rate) and high direct-sequence spreading is worked out, including the consideration of the turbo-coded modulation scheme. Simulation results indicate that turbo codes with small block interleavers do not outperform conventional convolutional codes. Furthermore, it is shown that for coherent demodulation, low code rates and low DS spreading is superior to high code rates and high DS spreading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","volume":"17","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6470753","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the performance of turbo codes and turbo-coded modulation in a DS-CDMA environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the performance of turbo codes and turbo-coded modulation in a DS-CDMA environment","sourcePdf":"00814830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080129S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","articleId":"814830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":814831,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Jie Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Kun-Jie Wang","id":"37365206800"},{"name":"Yan Yao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Yao","id":"37275326300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"814831","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Interference suppression","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Adaptive filters","Least squares approximation","Kalman filters","Nonlinear filters","Statistics","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","nonlinear filters","filtering theory","adaptive signal processing","adaptive Kalman filters","least mean squares methods","nonlinear functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband interference suppression","CDMA spread-spectrum systems","nonlinear algorithms","interference suppression filters","code division multiple access","multiuser decision-directed Kalman filter","nonlinear approximate conditional mean filter","nonlinear function","nonlinear adaptive least mean square filters","performance","simulation results","linear algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The narrow-band interference suppression capability of spread-spectrum systems can be further enhanced by employing interference suppression filters.

Unlike the previous MIC, which tries to remove the lump sum of the multiple-access interference (MAI) and self-interference (SI), this introduced MIC attempts to cancel only the MAI and part of the SI due to the intersymbol interference, while treating the remaining SI created by the current symbol as useful information for symbol decision. In this technique, the RAKE combining is used to collect signal replicas over multiple fading paths. Upper and lower bounds on the bit error probability are derived using a Gaussian approximation and the characteristic function method. Furthermore, effects of channel estimation error on the performance are studied. Analytical and simulation results show that the introduced MIC can provide a performance extremely close to that in an ideal single-user environment and outperforms the previous MIC even in the presence of channel estimation error.","doi":"10.1109/49.814833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17644/00814833.pdf","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.814833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage interference cancellation with diversity reception for asynchronous QPSK DS/CDMA systems over multipath fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Multistage interference cancellation with diversity reception for asynchronous QPSK DS/CDMA systems over multipath fading channels","volume":"17","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6470756","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814833/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage interference cancellation with diversity reception for asynchronous QPSK DS/CDMA systems over multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"00814833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065138S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"14","articleId":"814833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":814834,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Specifically, this paper introduces a channel model for, and analyzes the performance of, a system in an environment where the multipath signals on each of the diversity branches of a RAKE receiver have varying fading characteristics. This scenario would typically describe urban environments where a large number of multipath echoes are present, each with different fading statistics resulting from the nonhomogeneous propagation paths seen by each multipath echo. It is shown that nonuniform fading parameters for multipath signals can severely influence the system performance, especially at high E/sub b//N/sub 0/ levels. Furthermore, it is shown that the conventional assumption of identical fading statistics for all RAKE receiver branches provide a lower bound on the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/49.814834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17644/00814834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.814834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17644","startPage":"2181","endPage":"2196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular channel modeling and the performance of DS-CDMA systems with antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=814834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cellular channel modeling and the performance of DS-CDMA systems with antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6470757","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular channel modeling and the performance of DS-CDMA systems with antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00814834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065447S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"5","articleId":"814834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":814842,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

The emerging MPEG-4 standard for multimedia applications allows script-based compositing of audiovisual scenes from multiple audio and visual objects. This involves the composition of the output frame by alpha-blending of Video Object Planes (VOPs). A coprocessor architecture is presented, that works in parallel to an MPEG-4 video- and audio-decoder, and performs computation and bandwidth intensive low-level algorithms for image compositing. The processor has on-chip memories that allow preload of data before it is accessed. VHDL implementation and synthesis for a 0.5/spl mu/ process show an estimate of 100 MHz achievable clock-frequency and 10 k gates for arithmetic and control circuitry which results in roughly 5 mm/sup 2/ silicon area. Overall performance is sufficient to compose more than 5 full-screen VOPs with a background of size 704/spl times/576 each at 30 Hz.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.1998.814863","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Circuits and Systems.

The network is able to detect faults in the nonideal circuit, in which the tolerance of elements is taken into account. Two cases of analog circuits have been simulated and checked: the RLC circuit at multiple measurement points and the measurement done at external nodes of the circuit for multiple frequencies.

The main goal is to achieve low residual offsets by chopping at high frequencies reducing at the same time the 1/f noise of the amplifier. Measurements on a 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS realization show reduction of 1/f noise and 18nV//spl radic/Hz residual thermal noise at low frequencies. The residual offset is lower than 100 /spl mu/V up to 8 MHz chopping frequency.

We elaborated two new terms that are added to the classical UTD diffraction coefficient, so that we obtain continuity of the total field. This new UTD formulation is compared to a numerical method based on finite difference time domain (FDTD). We outline the adaptation of the FDTD grid calculation, which was necessary to isolate only one edge diffraction and to treat two-dimensional (2-D) structures with two infinite sides. This comparison allows one to conclude that the new diffraction coefficient is relevant for the case of a lossy dielectric wedge. Then we present a comparison between two different versions of the UTD diffraction coefficient based on single or multiple reflection in the case of a dielectric slab. Thus, we can conclude to the significance of the multipaths for modeling dielectric structures. Finally, we analyze the results obtained with two consecutive wedge vertices in order to show that the slope diffraction related to the doubly diffracted field allows one to predict the field behind the structure when the transmitted field does not exist.","doi":"10.1109/8.814950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17643/00814950.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.814950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17643","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffraction by lossy dielectric wedges using both heuristic UTD formulations and FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=814950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diffraction by lossy dielectric wedges using both heuristic UTD formulations and FDTD","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/814950/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6472141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffraction by lossy dielectric wedges using both heuristic UTD formulations and FDTD","sourcePdf":"00814950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036127S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"27","articleId":"814950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":814951,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

The first supposes that speed varies insignificantly during the first cycles after the voltage drop and recovery points to solve analytically the electrical transients in these cycles. The second neglects the electrical transient during the sag duration for a quick evaluation of the speed loss. Machine sensitivity to voltage sags is graphically shown.

To illustrate the technique, small excitation disturbance tests are conducted on a 7.5 kVA, 240 V, 60 Hz round rotor synchronous generator at various levels of excitation and loading. The small excitation disturbance responses are processed by a recursive maximum likelihood algorithm to yield estimates of mutual inductances L/sub ad/ and L/sub aq/ at each operating condition. By developing a suitable training pattern, variables representative of generator operating condition are mapped to mutual inductances L/sub ad/ and L/sub aq/. The developed models are validated with measurements not used in the training process and with large disturbance responses.","doi":"10.1109/60.815022","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17640/00815022.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.815022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based saturation model for round rotor synchronous generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Rotors","Synchronous generators","Air gaps","Artificial neural networks","Voltage","Parameter estimation","Magnetic flux","Saturation magnetization","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous generators","rotors","electric machine analysis computing","neural nets","parameter estimation","inductance","maximum likelihood estimation","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","saturation model","round rotor synchronous generator","artificial neural network","ANN","excitation level","rotor angle","real power generation","generator saturation","small excitation disturbance tests","loading","small excitation disturbance responses","recursive maximum likelihood algorithm","mutual inductances estimation","training pattern","parameter estimation","7.5 kVA","240 V","60 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based saturation model for round rotor synchronous generator","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6472926","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based saturation model for round rotor synchronous generator","sourcePdf":"00815022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067527S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"9","articleId":"815022","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":815024,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The results are compared with measurements.","doi":"10.1109/60.815034","startPage":"1100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17640/00815034.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.815034","endPage":"1107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical model of switched reluctance machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"An analytical model of switched reluctance machines","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6472937","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical model of switched reluctance machines","sourcePdf":"00815034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052582S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"55","articleId":"815034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":815037,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The model is used to compute/predict the characteristic frequency components which are indicative of rotor bar and connector breakages in the armature current waveforms and developed torque profiles, respectively. It was found that failures due to rotor connector breakages tend to degrade the developed torque of the machine considerably more than failures due to rotor bar breakages. Also, the effects and implications of rotor breakages on core loss distributions are quantified and described. Furthermore, this model has great potential in future applications to generate databases for use in overall noninvasive diagnostics of faults or troubleshooting in relation to quality assessments of the state of the motor and the overall drive.","doi":"10.1109/60.815043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17640/00815043.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.815043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17640","startPage":"1167","endPage":"1176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis and characterization of effects of broken bars and connectors in squirrel-cage induction motors by a time-stepping coupled finite element-state space modeling approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis and characterization of effects of broken bars and connectors in squirrel-cage induction motors by a time-stepping coupled finite element-state space modeling approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815043/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6472945","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis and characterization of effects of broken bars and connectors in squirrel-cage induction motors by a time-stepping coupled finite element-state space modeling approach","sourcePdf":"00815043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053059S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"50","articleId":"815043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":815048,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

The operation of the ALMC results in a smooth and fast loss minimization, thus overcoming the major drawbacks of existing on-line loss minimization control approaches. The proposed ALMC provides more energy savings in comparison with other methods and extends the application of loss minimization control to a class of motor drives requiring efficient and smooth operation in the face of frequent changes in the operating point.

Using the irradiance as input signal, the network models the effects of random cloud movement on the electrical variables of the maximum power point tracker (MPPT) and the variables of the utility-linked inverter over a short period of time. During short time intervals, the irradiance is considered as the only varying input parameter affecting the electrical variables of the system. The advantages of artificial neural network (ANN) simulation over standard linear models is that it does not require the knowledge of internal system parameters, involves less computational effort, and offers a compact solution for multiple-variable problems. The model can easily integrated into a typical utility system and resulting system behavior can be determined. The viability of the battery-supported PV power system as a dispatchable unit is also investigated. The simulated results are compared with the experimental results captured during cloudy days.

It first develops a detailed model and then compares four control algorithms based on conventional and intelligent control theories. A simple PI conventional controller for the exciter loop is carried out by using a first order model. When the system operating points change, the PI controller fails to provide sufficient damping or acceptable performance. Therefore both fuzzy voltage and fuzzy power regulators are introduced. Also a conventional adaptive pitch controller is proposed to adjust the pitch angle of the rotor blades in order to maximize the energy capture and reduce the mechanical loads. As an alternative to this controller, a neural network controller is also designed. Using the existing nonlinear wind model and the different control algorithms, the dynamic behavior of the controlled (WECS) is simulated. By selecting convenient wind data, the system characteristics such as its tracking performance, its robustness and its ability to recover from large disturbances are studied and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/60.815111","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1604","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/17640/00815111.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.815111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent control of a class of wind energy conversion systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent control","Wind energy","Control systems","Power system modeling","Damping","Voltage","Regulators","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind power plants","power station control","intelligent control","control system synthesis","two-term control","fuzzy neural nets","voltage control","power control","control system analysis","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind energy conversion systems","intelligent control schemes","WECS","control algorithms","PI conventional controller","exciter loop","first order model","system operating points","damping","performance","fuzzy voltage regulator","fuzzy power regulator","adaptive pitch controller","rotor blade pitch angle control","neural network controller","tracking performance","robustness","disturbances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent control of a class of wind energy conversion systems","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6473007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent control of a class of wind energy conversion systems","sourcePdf":"00815111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041331S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"101","articleId":"815111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":815114,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The array systems shown in this paper are aimed at code-division multiple-access (CDMA) mobile communications. The desired beam pattern can be obtained from the weight vector through the scalar product between the weight vector and the signals, because the in-phase and quadrature components of the baseband signal preserve the magnitude and phase of the signal at each antenna element. Since the weight vector of the TEA system is computed from the solution of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest-magnitude eigenvalue, the TEA system outperforms the switching-beam array system when the desired signal is sufficiently larger than each of the interfering signals, because of the high processing gain. As the ratio of the power of the desired signals to the power of the interfering signals becomes lower, the superiority in the performance of the two systems is reversed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/74/17654/00815315.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/74.815315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.815315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of tracking-beam arrays and switching-beam arrays operating in a CDMA mobile communication channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Antenna arrays","Mobile communication","Phased arrays","Mobile antennas","Adaptive arrays","Communication switching","Target tracking","Base stations","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","land mobile radio","radio tracking","adaptive antenna arrays","multiuser channels","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","array signal processing","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking-beam arrays","switching-beam arrays","CDMA mobile communication channel","smart antenna systems","code-division multiple-access","beam pattern","weight vector","scalar product","quadrature components","in-phase components","baseband signal","antenna element","eigenvector","largest-magnitude eigenvalue","interfering signals","high processing gain","desired to interfering signal power ratio","system performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of tracking-beam arrays and switching-beam arrays operating in a CDMA mobile communication channel","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6481063","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of tracking-beam arrays and switching-beam arrays operating in a CDMA mobile communication channel","sourcePdf":"00815315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041367S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"31","articleId":"815315","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":815322,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In this methodology, effects of low-level (i.e., transistor or circuit level) faults are propagated to higher levels (i.e., system level) using fault dictionaries. The primary fault models are obtained via simulation of the transistor-level effect of a radiation particle penetrating a device. The resulting current bursts constitute the first-level fault dictionary and are used in the circuit-level simulation to determine the impact on circuit latches and flip-flops. The latched outputs constitute the next level fault dictionary in the hierarchy and are applied in conducting fault injection simulation at the chip-level under selected workloads or application programs. Faults injected at the chip-level result in memory corruptions, which are used to form the next level fault dictionary for the system-level simulation of an application running on simulated hardware. When an application terminates, either normally or abnormally, the overall fault impact on the software behavior is quantified and analyzed. The system in this sense can be a single workstation or a network. The simulation method is demonstrated and validated in the case study of Myrinet (a commercial, high-speed network) based network system.","doi":"10.1109/32.815322","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","startPage":"619","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/17655/00815322.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.815322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical simulation approach to accurate fault modeling for system dependability evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Dictionaries","Circuit simulation","Application software","Analytical models","Power system modeling","Voltage","Space technology","Digital circuits","Latches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","virtual machines","fault tolerant computing","flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical simulation","fault modeling","system dependability evaluation","fault dictionaries","transistor-level effect","radiation particle","circuit-level simulation","circuit latches","flip-flops","fault injection simulation","memory corruptions","Myrinet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical simulation approach to accurate fault modeling for system dependability evaluation","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6464330","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815322/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical simulation approach to accurate fault modeling for system dependability evaluation","sourcePdf":"00815322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045937S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"28","articleId":"815322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":815323,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To help in this numerous software metrics and statistical models have been developed, with a correspondingly large literature. We provide a critical review of this literature and the state-of-the-art. Most of the wide range of prediction models use size and complexity metrics to predict defects. Others are based on testing data, the \"quality\" of the development process, or take a multivariate approach. The authors of the models have often made heroic contributions to a subject otherwise bereft of empirical studies. However, there are a number of serious theoretical and practical problems in many studies. The models are weak because of their inability to cope with the, as yet, unknown relationship between defects and failures. There are fundamental statistical and data quality problems that undermine model validity. More significantly many prediction models tend to model only part of the underlying problem and seriously misspecify it. To illustrate these points the Goldilock's Conjecture, that there is an optimum module size, is used to show the considerable problems inherent in current defect prediction approaches. Careful and considered analysis of past and new results shows that the conjecture lacks support and that some models are misleading. We recommend holistic models for software defect prediction, using Bayesian belief networks, as alternative approaches to the single-issue models used at present. We also argue for research into a theory of \"software decomposition\" in order to test hypotheses about defect introduction and help construct a better science of software engineering.","doi":"10.1109/32.815326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.815326","startPage":"675","endPage":"689","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/17655/00815326.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A critique of software defect prediction models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A critique of software defect prediction models","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6464334","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A critique of software defect prediction models","sourcePdf":"00815326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028217S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"568","articleId":"815326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":815340,"authors":[{"name":"M.O.

The algorithm combines the gradient descent technique with variable structure systems approach. The combination is performed by expressing the conventional weight update rule in continuous time and application of sliding mode control method to the gradient based training procedure. The proposed combination therefore exhibits a degree of robustness with respect to the unmodeled multivariable internal dynamics of gradient descent. With conventional training procedures, the excitation of this dynamics during a training cycle can lead to instability, which may be difficult to alleviate due to the multidimensionality of the solution space and the ambiguities on the free design parameters, such as learning rate or momentum coefficient. This paper demonstrates that a computationally intelligent system can be trained such that the adjustable parameter values are forced to settle down (parameter stabilization) while minimizing an appropriate cost function (cost optimization).

In this work we study TCP performance independent of the type of network by considering the different possible characteristics of the connection path.

This ensures that the desired data rate which achieves good voice quality can be provided \"everywhere\". As a result, SINRs that are much larger than the target are achieved over a large portion of the cellular coverage area. For a packet data service, the larger SINR can be used to provide higher data rates by reducing coding or spreading and/or increasing the constellation density. It is straight-forward to see that cellular spectral efficiency (in terms of b/s/Hz/sector) can be increased by a factor of two or more if users with better links are served at higher data rates. Procedures that exploit this are already in place for all the major cellular standards in the world.

In terms of the number of users that can be accommodated on a given channel, there are two distinct classes of multiple access techniques. The first class includes the well-known FDMA, TDMA, and OCDMA. On a channel whose bandwidth is N times the bandwidth of the individual user signals, these techniques can accommodate N users without any mutual interference, but not a single additional user can be supported beyond this limiting number. The second class includes CDMA with pseudo-noise spreading sequences (which we refer to as PN-CDMA) and some other related schemes. PN-CDMA does not have a hard limit on the number of users that can be accommodated, but is subject to multi-user interference which grows linearly with the number of users. In this article, after reviewing the capacity limits of existing multiple access techniques, we describe some newly introduced concepts which allow us to accommodate N users without any interference while also accommodating additional users at the expense of some SNR penalty.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/17664/00815455.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.815455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.815455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17664","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending the capacity of multiple access channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Frequency division multiaccess","Time division multiple access","AWGN","Digital communication","Coaxial cables","Optical fiber cables","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","time division multiple access","code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","interference (signal)","digital communication","multiuser channels","channel capacity","subscriber loops","iterative methods","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple access channels","channel capacity","digital communications","FDMA","TDMA","OCDMA","channel bandwidth","multi-user interference","pseudo-noise spreading sequences","PN-CDMA","capacity limits","SNR penalty","access networks","AWGN","iterative multistage detection","orthogonal signal waveforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Extending the capacity of multiple access channels","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6479482","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending the capacity of multiple access channels","sourcePdf":"00815455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058558S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"77","articleId":"815455","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":815456,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper demonstrates that by use of a judicious decomposition of the signal and noise, the log-likelihood function of source location is, in fact, directly proportional to the adaptive MV beamformer output power. In the proposed model, the measurement consists of an unknown temporal signal whose spatial wavefront is known as a function of its unknown location, which is embedded in complex Gaussian noise with unknown but positive definite covariance. Further, in cases where the available observation time is insufficient, a constrained ML estimator is derived here that is closely related to MV beamforming with a diagonally loaded data covariance matrix estimate. The performance of the constrained ML estimator compares favorably with robust MV techniques, giving slightly better root-mean-square error (RMSE) angle-of-arrival estimation of a plane-wave signal in interference. More importantly, however, the fact that such optimal ML techniques are closely related to conventional robust MV methods, such as diagonal loading, lends theoretical justification to the use of these practical approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6473853","displayDocTitle":"Relationships between adaptive minimum variance beamforming and optimal source localization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relationships between adaptive minimum variance beamforming and optimal source localization","sourcePdf":"00815474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039726S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"57","articleId":"815474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":815475,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Such models arise when single receiver data from multiple sources is fractionally sampled (assuming that there is excess bandwidth) or when an antenna array is used with or without fractional sampling. We consider the estimation of (partial) channel impulse response and design of finite-length minimum mean-square error (MMSE) blind equalizers. We extend the multistep linear prediction approach to MIMO channels where the multichannel transfer function need not be column reduced. Moreover, we allow infinite impulse response (IIR) channels as well as the case where the \"subchannel\" transfer functions have common zeros. In the past, this approach has been confined to SIMO finite impulse response (FIR) channels with no common subchannel zeros. A related existing approach applicable to MIMO channels is restricted to FIR column-reduced systems with equal length subchannels. In our approach, the knowledge of the nature of the underlying model (FIR or IIR) or the model order is not required. Our approach works when the \"subchannel\" transfer functions have common zeros, as long as the common zeros are minimum-phase zeros. The sources are recovered up to a unitary mixing matrix and are further \"unmixed\" using higher order statistics of the data. Illustrative computer simulation examples are provided.","doi":"10.1109/78.815476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17671/00815476.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.815476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17671","startPage":"26","endPage":"38","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistep linear predictors-based blind identification and equalization of multiple-input multiple-output channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multistep linear predictors-based blind identification and equalization of multiple-input multiple-output channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815476/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6473855","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistep linear predictors-based blind identification and equalization of multiple-input multiple-output channels","sourcePdf":"00815476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040256S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","articleId":"815476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":815477,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed algorithm asymptotically provides the maximum SINR estimate of the signal with the desired code (SDC) by optimally combining desired signals from different paths and canceling strong multiuser access interference (MUAI). A two-dimensional (2-D) matched filter structure is used where not only different temporal samples of the matched filter output are processed but where those from matched filters connected to different antennas are processed as well. In contrast to previously proposed techniques, an exact code synchronization for the SDC is not required. The algorithm presented herein asymptotically provides the arrival time of the multipaths within a bit period and the optimum beamformers for extracting each of them. Space-time filters for combining the fingers across both space and time while canceling the MUAIs are constructed correspondingly. The instrumental property exploited by this technique is the fact that although the respective spectra of the SDC and MUAI components at the matched filter output are statistically identical, the respective spectra of their squared values differ. A simplified RAKE structure-based receiver is also proposed. The 2-D RAKE receiver considerably decreases the computations but requires a coarse SDC code synchronization. A technique to achieve coarse SDC code synchronization is also proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity space-time processor for DS-CDMA communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.815477","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17671/00815477.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.815477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17671","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity space-time processor for DS-CDMA communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6473856","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity space-time processor for DS-CDMA communications","sourcePdf":"00815477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037639S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","articleId":"815477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":815479,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaohua Li","id":"37280865500"},{"name":"H.

First, we present a block algorithm that performs the QR factorization of the received data matrix as a whole. Then, a recursive algorithm is developed based on the QR factorization by updating a rank-revealing ULV decomposition. Compared with existing algorithms in the same category, our algorithms are computationally more efficient. The computation in each recursion of the recursive algorithm is on the order of O(m/sup 2/) if only equalization is required, where m is the dimension of the received signal vector. Our recursive algorithm preserves the fast convergence property of the subspace algorithms, thus converging faster than other adaptive algorithms such as the super-exponential algorithm with comparable computational complexities. Moreover, our proposed algorithms do not require noise variance estimation.

Except for an overall delay needed for physical realization, QRD-LSL interpolators can substantially outperform QRD-LSL predictors while retaining all the desirable features of the latter.","doi":"10.1109/78.815480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17671/00815480.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.815480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QR-decomposition-based least-squares lattice interpolators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815480/","displayDocTitle":"QR-decomposition-based least-squares lattice interpolators","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6473859","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QR-decomposition-based least-squares lattice interpolators","sourcePdf":"00815480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067952S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","articleId":"815480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":815481,"authors":[{"name":"Junyu Mai","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Advanced Research Department, Saint Jude Medical Cardiac Rhythm Management, Sylmar, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Junyu Mai","id":"37088049272"},{"name":"A.H.

The lattice can be proven to use a minimal number of delay elements and to completely span a large class of LPPRFBs: all analysis and synthesis filters have the same FIR length, sharing the same center of symmetry. The lattice also structurally enforces both linear-phase and perfect reconstruction properties, is capable of providing fast and efficient implementation, and avoids the costly matrix inversion problem in the optimization process. From a block transform perspective, the new lattice can be viewed as representing a family of generalized lapped biorthogonal transform (GLBT) with an arbitrary number of channels M and arbitrarily large overlap. The relaxation of the orthogonal constraint allows the GLBT to have significantly different analysis and synthesis basis functions, which can then be tailored appropriately to fit a particular application. Several design examples are presented along with a high-performance GLBT-based progressive image coder to demonstrate the potential of the new transforms.","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17671/00815484.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.815484","doi":"10.1109/78.815484","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Filter bank","Lattices","Finite impulse response filter","Signal synthesis","Image coding","Delay","Signal processing","Signal analysis","Band pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image reconstruction","linear phase filters","channel bank filters","lattice filters","FIR filters","network synthesis","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfect reconstruction filter bank","lattice structure","lattice design","lattice application","image coding","M-channel linear-phase filter bank","singular value decomposition","SVD","delay elements","analysis filter","synthesis filter","FIR length","block transform","generalized lapped biorthogonal transform","orthogonal constraint relaxation","synthesis basis function","analysis basis function","progressive image coder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815484/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Linear-phase perfect reconstruction filter bank: lattice structure, design, and application in image coding","accessionNumber":"6473863","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-phase perfect reconstruction filter bank: lattice structure, design, and application in image coding","sourcePdf":"00815484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046365S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"130","articleId":"815484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":815487,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

In particular, a proposed method of calculating the 2/sup r/-point Fourier transform requires 2/sup r-1/(r-3)+2 multiplications and 2/sup r-1/(r+9)-r/sup 2/-3r-6 additions. In terms of the paired transforms, the splitting of the 2/sup r/-point Hadamard transform is described.

A genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied to fuzzy modeling for identification of the structure of a fuzzy model and selection of input variables. Trade-offs among multiple criteria make the search problem more complicated. For easy determination of weights on the criteria, a framework of model generation and testing was proposed by the authors. This framework divides the process of fuzzy modeling into two blocks, i.e. a model generation block and model testing block. The model generation block has criteria, with a higher degree of importance, and the model testing block has those with a lower degree of importance. In this paper, the idea of Pareto optimality is introduced to this framework and the effectiveness of the framework is examined by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.815568","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17562/00815568.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"319 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

It is often applied by describing both the input and output in fuzzy variables, and composing the fuzzy relation \"R\" represented by multi-dimensional matrix, which is based on the \"if-then\" fuzzy rules. The method of Mamdani and the methods using a GA (genetic algorithm) were proposed to solve the fuzzy relation equation. However, for most multivariable systems there occurs the problem of insufficient memory for calculation. To cope with this problem, Gegov (1994) proposed a method using a two-dimensional fuzzy relation for multivariable systems. Though it is effective in the sense of reducing the calculation, it does not often satisfy all of the fuzzy rules. Especially in the case when outputs are not alike in shape in spite of their similar inputs, it is difficult to find the fuzzy relation representing the system correctly. Therefore, another method suitable for multivariable cases is needed. We propose a technique to construct the reduced dimensional fuzzy relation for multivariable systems. The optimal fuzzy relation can be chosen among the candidates that satisfy all of the rules, by evaluating the number of matrix elements. Here, a GA is adopted for efficient search. In the case that we have several solutions from the search, the set that gives the lowest dimension is selected. Then we decide the value of matrix elements by least square errors that are obtained by applying the same inputs to the resulting (reduced dimensional) fuzzy relation and original one. Finally we show some simulation examples, which show the usefulness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.815569","startPage":"320","endPage":"325 vol.5","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The learning structure consists of a pool of neurons. For a primary skill, a subset of neurons is used. A genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to search for adequate connections and weights for performing the skill. To develop more advanced techniques, unused neurons are selected. The GA is then used to search for connections within the new set of neurons and between the newly selected neurons and the old ones. The original structure is not altered. This preserves the previously learned skills and the new skill can be established based on existent ones. It is expected that, using such hierarchical learning, learning and skill growing can be more efficient. Although the purpose of this study is to resolve the problem of skill expansion upon completing design, it is noted that the scheme can also be applied to relax learning difficulty by decomposing a difficult skill.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.815576","startPage":"361","endPage":"366 vol.5","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

We provide a hierarchical RL algorithm composed of local linear controllers and TD-learning, which are both very simple. The continuous state space is discretized into an array of coarse boxes, and each box has its own local linear controller for choosing primitive continuous actions. The higher-level of the hierarchy accumulates state-values using tables with one entry for each box. Each linear controller improves the local control policy by using an actor-critic method. The algorithm was applied to a simulation of a cart-pole swing-up problem, and feasible solutions are found in less time than those of conventional discrete RL methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6513672","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic real-valued reinforcement learning to solve a nonlinear control problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic real-valued reinforcement learning to solve a nonlinear control problem","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00815604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041453S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"1","articleId":"815604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":815605,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We propose a new architecture of a GA engine, which we call H/sup 3/ engine, whose pipeline never stalls. To remove all of the pipeline stalls, our H/sup 3/ engine employs steady state GA and pipelines the roulette wheel selection using a combination of binary search and linear search. We implement the H/sup 3/ engine on an FPGA and evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that H/sup 3/ performs GAs about 730 times faster than software.

To achieve this, the evolutionary approach has been proposed and has shown its efficiency in synthesizing controllers. In this paper, we present a new approach, called an example-based approach, for evolving robot behaviors. Instead of using lower level quantities, such as sensor or motor activities, to quantitatively describe the desired robot behaviors in defining fitness functions as other evolutionary robotics systems do, we give behavior examples to the evolutionary system to train populations of controllers. Experimental results show that our approach not only can construct robot behaviors automatically but also overcome the difficulty of defining fitness functions by lower level terms as in traditional work for evolving robot controllers.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.815623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1999.815623","startPage":"618","endPage":"623 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

This paper addresses the problem of automatic modulation recognition of digital communication signals using neural networks. Seven digital modulation schemes have been considered and seven features have been used as inputs to the neural network (NN) to perform the classification. Several NN structures have been tested that perform at over 99% accuracy at signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of 10 dB. Design considerations for the NN classifier are discussed and the implementation of these has been shown to produce significant reduction in network size. The performance of the NN-based classifier has also been compared with that of a decision-theoretic classifier; it was found that the NN slightly outperforms the decision-theoretic classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815756","publicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

By incorporating causal and localised training on the actual data being coded, rather than training separate data, the network weights are continuously updated. This results in a highly adaptive predictor, with localised optimisation based on the stochastic gradient learning. The causal nature of the training means no transmission overhead is required and also enables lossless coding of the images. In addition to the adaptive prediction, the results presented here also incorporate an arithmetic coding scheme, producing results which are better than CALIC and comparable to TMW, the state of the art lossless compression in the literature. This shows that near-optimal results can be obtained with the fundamental concept of adaptive training. The use of a neural network provides a simple means for performing this training.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815757","startPage":"653","endPage":"656 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

Instead, the output/input behavior of designed CNN filters is restrictive. Therefore it is significant that the structure of network model be discussed. The proposed CNN filter is formed by cascade connecting two 3-layer CNNs. In order to train the weighting factors, the backpropagation method is applied. Through simulations, it is shown that the target object is enhanced in the noisy environment.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815760","startPage":"665","endPage":"668 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

Therefore, efficient dynamic channel allocation techniques are needed to reduce the blocking probability of the arriving calls and to enhance the capacity of the cellular system. In this paper, a new dynamic channel assignment algorithm (DCA) is proposed. The channel assignment problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem that is implemented by a modified, discrete Hopfield network for which a fast hardware implementation has been previously proposed in the literature. As a figure of merit, the performance of the proposed DCA technique is derived by computer simulation in terms of the blocking probability of the arriving calls. Comparisons with the classical fixed channel allocation (FCA) technique have been carried out to highlight the performance of the proposed DCA algorithm. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed DCA is much better than that of the FCA.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815762","startPage":"673","endPage":"676 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

Previously, an architecture to perform the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) within the SP array has been reported. A feature of the SP-DWT architecture is that the wavelet coefficients for each subband are not clustered together but are distributed in a certain pattern throughout the SP array. An encoder architecture for the embedded zerotree wavelet (EZW) algorithm has been reported which makes use of a modified EZW algorithm where instead of having to scan the whole wavelet coefficient in each pass of the algorithm, the modified algorithm only requires the scanning of one bit of the coefficient in each pass. In this paper, we present a scheme which takes advantage of the coefficient distribution in the SP array so that the bits of the coefficients are shifted out of the SP array in such a way that they can be input into the EZW encoder immediately with minimum buffering requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart pixel VLSI architecture for embedded zerotree wavelet coding","publicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

As a consequence, the adaptive beamformer has a frequency invariant response for nearfield sources, decorrelates coherent interferers (thus combating signal cancellation) and has a smaller number of parameters to be adapted compared to a conventional beamformer.

The system will be used to demonstrate concepts of antenna design, RF beamforming, digital beamforming, calibration techniques, adaptive algorithms, RFI suppression and analogue-to-digital conversion. This paper presents some initial results from research on calibration techniques and hierarchical beamforming algorithms. Calibration is an important aspect of all beamforming systems, as it directly affects the ability of an adaptive or non-adaptive beamformer to accurately suppress RFI. The suppression of interference will determine the success of next generation astronomical instruments. The unique dual-hierarchy beamforming structure of the experimental array, called the One Square Metre Array (OSMA), presents two possibilities for RFI suppression. This occurs at the RF level, before digitisation, and afterwards using a digital adaptive beamformer. Additionally, the RF beamforming significantly reduces the calibration requirements of the system, as its inherent averaging process reduces the complexity of the array manifold to a (nearly) predictable pattern.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17633","startPage":"869","endPage":"872 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

Traditional GAs initialize the population with random generated individuals and evolve that population. When this method is applied to design medium to high complexity FIR filters, GA can not find the global minimum, easily. In order to overcome this problem, this paper proposes an incremental evolution strategy. The method starts by evolving a filter with a small number of taps. After convergence, the number of taps is increased and the population is initialized with the result of the previous evolution. This process is continued until a predefined error level is reached. The method outperforms the well known FIR filter design methods: window based design, Parks and McClellan equiripple algorithm, and least squares design.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815842","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1008 vol.2","publicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

However, many of those same users can be considered nomads, in that they carry computers and communication devices with them in their travels between office, home, airport, hotel, automobile, and so on. Access to the Internet is necessary not only from one's \"home base\", but also while in transit and after reaching one's destination. A number of capabilities must be put in place to support this new paradigm of nomadicity. Among these, we can include independence of location, motion, platform, and, with widespread presence, of access to remote files, systems, and services. Essentially, one seeks to provide the illusion of connectivity even when the nomad is disconnected and to provide seamless access to Internet services wherever the nomad travels. To achieve this, not only must the infrastructure be enhanced to provide these capabilities, but applications must become nomadically enabled as well. These ideas form the essence of the major shift to nomadic computing. But nomadic computing is merely the first step of the vision foreseen by the author. The next step will take us out of the netherworld of cyberspace and into the physical world of smart spaces. Environments will come alive with embedded technology, so that no longer will we see Internet services as coming to us from the screen on a computer, but rather those services will be embedded in the environment.","doi":"10.1109/4236.815852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4236/17690/00815852.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4236.815852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nomadic computing and smart spaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=815852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/815852/","displayDocTitle":"Nomadic computing and smart spaces","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6471166","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nomadic computing and smart spaces","sourcePdf":"00815852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031319S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","isNumber":"17690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4236","citationCount":"8","articleId":"815852","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":815987,"authors":[{"name":"Duk Sun Yun","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Graduate School of Kookmin Univ, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Duk Sun Yun","id":"37329848500"},{"name":"Jung Ha Kim","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung Ha Kim","id":"37616664200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5801-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"815987","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor fusion","Control systems","Intelligent vehicles","Magnetic sensors","Global Positioning System","Vehicle detection","Satellite navigation systems","Earth","Inertial navigation","Dead reckoning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fusion","gyroscopes","Global Positioning System","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fusion","gyro controller system","smart vehicle","GPS","selective availability","INS","vehicle position","dead reckoning","wheel magnetic sensor","vehicle orientation"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, the GPS (Global Positioning System) is generally used for the car navigation system but it has some restrictions such as the discontinuity of Earth satellite's signals and artificial errors called SA (selective availability).

The DR (dead reckoning), which is one form of the INS uses a wheel magnetic sensor for the driving distance and a gyro sensor for the vehicle orientation. The black-box, which is the most important record after a car accident, contains data from acceleration sensors and a gyro sensor.

The nonlinear PCA is a candidate for data reduction/compression where multisensors are measurement the same type of signal, e.g., image or sound. In contrast the ICA is a candidate for fusing different types of signals, e.g., image, sound, acceleration, etc., to generate independent components. The PCA approach can be used to transfer compressed data then reconstruct the information bearing signal for use. While the ICA may be used to infer the condition/state of the environment, e.g., office building, airport, etc. Thus the two approaches can be integrated to form a complementary sensory fusion system.","doi":"10.1109/MFI.1999.815991","pdfPath":"/iel5/6615/17657/00815991.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"215","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1999 IEEE/SICE/RSJ.

Since the ideal interpolation function spatially is unlimited, several interpolation kernels of finite size have been introduced. This paper compares 1) truncated and windowed sine; 2) nearest neighbor; 3) linear; 4) quadratic; 5) cubic B-spline; 6) cubic; g) Lagrange; and 7) Gaussian interpolation and approximation techniques with kernel sizes from 1/spl times/1 up to 8/spl times/8. The comparison is done by: 1) spatial and Fourier analyses; 2) computational complexity as well as runtime evaluations; and 3) qualitative and quantitative interpolation error determinations for particular interpolation tasks which were taken from common situations in medical image processing. For local and Fourier analyses, a standardized notation is introduced and fundamental properties of interpolators are derived. Successful methods should be direct current (DC)-constant and interpolators rather than DC-inconstant or approximators. Each method's parameters are tuned with respect to those properties. This results in three novel kernels, which are introduced in this paper and proven to be within the best choices for medical image interpolation: the 6/spl times/6 Blackman-Harris windowed sinc interpolator, and the C2-continuous cubic kernels with N=6 and N=8 supporting points. For quantitative error evaluations, a set of 50 direct digital X-rays was used. They have been selected arbitrarily from clinical routine. In general, large kernel sizes were found to be superior to small interpolation masks. Except for truncated sine interpolators, all kernels with N=6 or larger sizes perform significantly better than N=2 or N=3 point methods (p/spl Lt/0.005). However, the differences within the group of large-sized kernels were not significant. Summarizing the results, the cubic 6/spl times/6 interpolator with continuous second derivatives, as defined in (24), can be recommended for most common interpolation tasks. It appears to be the fastest six-point kernel to implement computationally. It provides eminent local and Fourier properties, is easy to implement, and has only small errors. The same characteristics apply to B-spline interpolation, but the 6/spl times/6 cubic avoids the intrinsic border effects produced by the B-spline technique. However, the goal of this study was not to determine an overall best method, but to present a comprehensive catalogue of methods in a uniform terminology, to define general properties and requirements of local techniques, and to enable the reader to select that method which is optimal for his specific application in medical imaging.","doi":"10.1109/42.816070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.816070","endPage":"1075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17698/00816070.pdf","startPage":"1049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey: interpolation methods in medical image processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816070/","displayDocTitle":"Survey: interpolation methods in medical image processing","volume":"18","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6500083","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"10661324","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey: interpolation methods in medical image processing","sourcePdf":"00816070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04001S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"822","articleId":"816070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":816072,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.-S.

This method is based on the differential formulation of the forward scattering problem, which is solved by applying the finite-element method (FEM). Given a set of scattered field measurements, the objective is to minimize a cost function which consists of two terms. The first is the standard error term, which is related to the measurements and their estimates, while the second term, which is related to the Tikhonov regularization, is used to heal the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. The iterative Polak-Ribiere nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is applied to the minimization of the cost function. During each iteration of the algorithm, the direction of correction is computed by using a sensitivity analysis approach, which is carried out by an elaborate finite-element scheme. The adoption of the finite-element method results in sparse systems of equations, while the computational burden is further reduced by applying the adjoint state vector methodology. Finally, a microwave medical imaging application, which is related to the detection of proliferated bone marrow, is examined, while the robustness of the proposed technique in the presence of noise and for different regularization levels is investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17698/00816074.pdf","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.816074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.816074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=816074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave imaging using the finite-element method and a sensitivity analysis approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave imaging","Finite element methods","Sensitivity analysis","Scattering parameters","Cost function","Iterative algorithms","Image reconstruction","Two dimensional displays","Measurement standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave imaging","inverse problems","finite element analysis","sensitivity analysis","biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constitutive parameters reconstruction method","scattered field measurements set","Tikhonov regularization","inverse problem ill-posedness","inverse scattering","medical diagnostic imaging","iterative Polak-Ribiere nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm","cost function minimization","algorithm iteration","proliferated bone marrow detection","regularization levels","computational burden","adjoint state vector methodology"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Bone Marrow","Bone and Bones","Finite Element Analysis","Humans","Microwaves","Muscle, Skeletal","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Microwave imaging using the finite-element method and a sensitivity analysis approach","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6500087","pubMedId":"10661328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave imaging using the finite-element method and a sensitivity analysis approach","sourcePdf":"00816074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07132S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"27","articleId":"816074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":816098,"authors":[{"name":"Lilei Ye","affiliation":["Department of Experimental Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"lastName":"Lilei Ye","id":"37087221719"},{"name":"Zonghe Lai","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Production Engineering Research, IVF, Molndal, Sweden"],"lastName":"Zonghe Lai","id":"37087163756"},{"name":"Johan Liu","affiliation":["Swedish Institute of Production Engineering Research, IVF, Molndal, Sweden"],"lastName":"Johan Liu","id":"37087165064"},{"name":"A.

The dielectric properties of an infinite-half space of a material are calculated from the measured reflection properties referenced to the waveguide aperture. This calculation relies on a theoretical and numerical derivation of the reflection coefficient likewise referenced to the waveguide aperture. Most of these derivations assume the dominant mode field distribution across the waveguide aperture. However, when dealing with low permittivity and low loss dielectric materials, there may exist significant errors when calculating the dielectric properties from the measured reflection coefficient. These errors have also shown to be more significant in the upper frequency portion of a waveguide band. More accurate results are obtained when higher order modes are considered in addition to the dominant waveguide mode. However, most studies incorporating higher-order modes have used various approximations when calculating the reflection properties and have not provided a full discussion on the influences of dielectric properties of the infinite-half space and the frequency of operation. This paper gives a rigorous and exact formulation in which the dominant mode and the evanescent higher-order modes are used as basis functions to obtain the solution for the reflection coefficient at the waveguide aperture. The analytic formulation uses Fourier analysis in addition to the forcing of the necessary boundary conditions at the waveguide aperture. The solution also readily accounts for the complex contributions of both TE and TM higher-order modes. Finally, the influences of the dielectric properties of the infinite-half space and the frequency of operation are investigated.","doi":"10.1109/19.816127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/17700/00816127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.816127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17700","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimode solution for the reflection properties of an open-ended rectangular waveguide radiating into a dielectric half-space: the forward and inverse problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=816127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multimode solution for the reflection properties of an open-ended rectangular waveguide radiating into a dielectric half-space: the forward and inverse problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6486060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimode solution for the reflection properties of an open-ended rectangular waveguide radiating into a dielectric half-space: the forward and inverse problems","sourcePdf":"00816127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07116S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"54","articleId":"816127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":816128,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

The two-port completely-filled waveguide (transmission line) technique is a robust measurement approach which is well suited for solid dielectric materials. In this case, the dielectric material can be relatively easily machined to fit inside the waveguide and the subsequent measurement of the scattering parameters of this two-port device renders the dielectric properties of the material filling the waveguide. However, this technique is not well suited for measuring the dielectric properties of granular and liquid materials. These materials are used in the production of various composites which are increasingly replacing the use of metals in many environments. If this technique is directly applied to these types of materials, several approximations either in the measurement apparatus or the formulation must be made. To overcome this problem, this paper describes a modification to this measurement technique utilizing two dielectric plugs which are used to house the granular or the liquid dielectric material. In this approach no approximation to the measurement apparatus is made while the presence of the plugs are fully accounted for in the derivations. Using this technique, the dielectric properties of cement powder, corn oil, antifreeze solution and tap water, constituting low- and high-loss dielectric materials (granular and liquid) were measured. In addition, the important issue of measurement uncertainty associated with this technique is also fully addressed. The issue of optimal choice of various measurement parameters is also discussed as it relates to the measurement uncertainty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6486061","volume":"48","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dielectric plug-loaded two-port transmission line measurement technique for dielectric property characterization of granular and liquid materials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectric plug-loaded two-port transmission line measurement technique for dielectric property characterization of granular and liquid materials","sourcePdf":"00816128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10238S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"86","articleId":"816128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":816141,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Often these techniques introduce some bias because of mismatch between the interpolating function and the actual discrete-time correlation function. We present a discrete-time TDE suitable for measuring the delay between two periodic signals with a resolution of a fraction of the sampling period. The technique is based upon a separate reference, external to the two measured signals, which is allowed to vary with subsample increments of delay. Simulations show that the incremental reference technique does not exhibit any significant bias and is superior to parabolic interpolation at both high and low SNR. The technique is suited to the measurement of group-delay or range of an object.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.816141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/17700/00816141.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1231","doi":"10.1109/19.816141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The estimation of subsample time delay of arrival in the discrete-time measurement of phase delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"The estimation of subsample time delay of arrival in the discrete-time measurement of phase delay","volume":"48","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6486074","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The estimation of subsample time delay of arrival in the discrete-time measurement of phase delay","sourcePdf":"00816141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020717S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"26","articleId":"816141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":816143,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The fundamental arithmetic operations are protected by low-cost residue codes, employing fault tolerance in multiplications and additions. Additional fault-tolerant design techniques are developed to protect other critical steps such as normalization and rounding, bit stuffing and index selection. For example, the decoding step that selects the next symbol is checked by comparing local values with estimates already calculated in other parts of the decoding structure. Bit stuffing, a procedure for limiting very long carry propagations, is checked through modified residue values, whereas normalization and rounding after multiplication are protected by efficiently modifying the multiplier to produce residue segments.","pdfPath":"/iel5/6617/17666/00816214.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PRDC.1999.816214","doi":"10.1109/PRDC.1999.816214","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 Pacific Rim International Symposium on Dependable Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=816214","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Fault tolerance","Data compression","Protection","Encoding","Decoding","Compression algorithms","Digital arithmetic","Differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","data compression","residue codes","arithmetic codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware fault tolerance","arithmetic coding","data compression","lossless compression algorithm protection","temporary hardware failures","low-cost residue codes","additions","multiplications","normalization","rounding","bit stuffing","index selection","decoding step","symbol","local values","very long carry propagations","modified residue values","residue segments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816214/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware fault tolerance in arithmetic coding for data compression","accessionNumber":"6461658","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"16-17 Dec. 1999","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware fault tolerance in arithmetic coding for data compression","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00816214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039049S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6617","articleId":"816214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":816241,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Man Cho","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Inje University, Kimhae, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Man Cho","id":"37087298391"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0739-5175"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4186"}],"articleNumber":"816241","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Backpropagation","Neural networks","Cells (biology)","Optical microscopy","Image databases","Large Hadron Collider","Shape measurement","Humans","Hospitals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","image classification","optical microscopy","biology computing","cellular biophysics","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromosome classification","backpropagation neural networks","centromeric index","density distribution","G-banded chromosome","feature vectors","two-layer neural network","error backpropagation training algorithm","Giemsa-banded human chromosomes","minimum classification error","hidden layer","density distribution samples","telocentric chromosomes","preprocessing time reduction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Centromere","Chromosome Banding","Chromosomes","Computer Simulation","Databases as Topic","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Metaphase","Neural Networks, Computer","Nonlinear Dynamics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=816241","abstract":"The feasibility of an artificial neural network as a chromosome classifier was examined in this study, using the relative length, the centromeric index, and the density distribution of G-banded chromosome as feature vectors. The two-layer neural network trained with the error backpropagation training algorithm showed good potential in classification of Giemsa-banded human chromosomes. The minimum classification error was obtained with the configuration that had 27 input nodes and 24 PEs in the hidden layer. However, this study also showed some problems. Only two experiments, which had 25 and 50 density distribution samples, respectively, were carried out, due to the long computation time of the backpropagation neural network. Also, the centromere finding algorithm used in this study could not apply to telocentric chromosomes (group D and group G) because of their very small short arms; their centromere locations were determined manually. The algorithm must be modified so that it can be applied to all types of chromosomes to reduce the preprocessing time. Better training algorithms to reduce training time are needed. The error backpropagation training algorithm requires very long training times. Next, finding the optimal number of input nodes that gives the minimum classification error requires a trial and error experiment. Finally, other chromosome features that reduce the classification error need to be examined.","doi":"10.1109/51.816241","pdfPath":"/iel5/51/17701/00816241.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"33","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.816241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chromosome classification using backpropagation neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Chromosome classification using backpropagation neural networks","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6477802","pubMedId":"10659427","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chromosome classification using backpropagation neural networks","sourcePdf":"00816241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031174S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"30","articleId":"816241","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":816243,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These features are fed to a neural network classifier based on geometrical fuzzy sets. Starting from the construction of the Voronoi diagram of the training patterns, an aggregation of Voronoi regions is performed, leading to the identification of larger regions belonging exclusively to one of the pattern classes.

Recently, physicists and computer scientists have realized that not only do their ideas about computing rest on partly accurate principles, but they miss out on a whole class of computation. Quantum physics offers powerful methods of encoding and manipulating information that are not possible within a classical framework.

In our work, the objective function used to measure the fitness of a proposed solution is the net profit of system operation for a given mission time. The net profit is obtained by subtracting from the service revenue all the costs associated with the system implementation and operation, i.e. component acquisition and repair costs, system downtime costs, accident costs to restore external environmental conditions and refund from losses in case of an accident. The objective function so designed accounts implicitly for any availability and reliability constraints through the system downtime and accident costs, respectively. Mathematically, then, the problem becomes a search in the system configuration space of that design which maximizes the objective function. In this work, the optimization algorithm is applied to a simple system, for validation purposes. The system is chosen in such a way that the objective function can be computed analytically and the configuration which maximises it can be found by inspection. The results obtained analytically are compared to those obtained by the genetic algorithm and confirm the good performance of the methodology implemented.","publicationTitle":"Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium. 2000 Proceedings.

These ships, of 80942 gross tonnage, have accommodation for 6700 containers, over 700 of which can be refrigerated containers-representing a substantial load on the ship's electrical supply. The ships are each propelled by a single 90000 HP (65 MW), 100 rev/min diesel engine. These ships are each designed with a 6.6 kV, 60 Hz main distribution system. During cruising at sea, up to 3.5 MW of electrical power is extracted from the ships' main diesel engine/propeller shaft via a salient pole shaft generator fitted to the main propeller shaft. Four diesel-engine driven, 3.6 MW generators are also installed to operate when power is not available from the shaft generator system, in port or during slow speed manoeuvring. Automatic no-break transfer between the generators is provided. The output of the shaft generator itself is at a low variable frequency, determined by the shaft speed. The output to the 6.6 kV system is changed up to a constant 60 Hz by a variable input frequency synchroconverter. The power system is supervised and controlled by a power management system employing a dedicated microprocessor controller. This paper describes the design of the rotating machine and variable speed drive components of this power system configuration. The following parts of the system are described: power system; shaft generator; variable frequency converter and its associated synchronous condenser; and control system.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19991041","publicationTitle":"1999.

The most significant challenge arising from controlling of the four-wire NPC inverter consists in stabilizing the neutral point potential at the DC link middle value. Unlike the three-wire case, all the switching states available from the four-wire NPC inverter are attributed to output voltage formation, no freedom remains for neutral potential control. As long as the output voltage is the primary control objective, the neutral potential must be left to an alternative approach for stabilization. A spontaneous neutral line current control loop exists also with the four-wire NPC inverter, which renders the neutral point potential to be self-balancing. However, under asymmetrical operation, the neutral point will be stabilized at some value other than the DC link middle potential. In particular, the response time of the current control loop is strongly load dependent. The proposed three-level buck-boost converter works with high switching frequency due to the nature of zero voltage switching. It offers tight control of the neutral potential with small rating device, fast response and high efficiency. Moreover, it uses the same NPC pole and requires no additional layout consideration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1999.816446","publicationTitle":"IECON'99.

However, a systematic method for designing and tuning the fuzzy logic controller is not developed yet. In this paper, an auto-tuning method for fuzzy logic controller based on the genetic algorithm is presented. In the proposed method, normalization parameters and membership function parameters of a fuzzy controller are translated into binary bit-strings, which are processed by the genetic algorithm in order to be optimized for the well-chosen objective function (i.e. fitness function). To examine the validity of the proposed method, a genetic algorithm based fuzzy controller for an indirect vector control of induction motors is simulated and an experiment is carried out. The simulation and experimental results show a significant enhancement in shortening development time and improving system performance over a traditional manually tuned fuzzy logic controller. Thus, in the case of changing motor, the proposed method is superior to a traditional method in the respect of development time and system performance.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1999.816464","pdfPath":"/iel5/6620/17670/00816464.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"629 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON'99.

With triangular membership functions, the left and right widths of these functions, the locations of their peaks, and the output fuzzy set corresponding to every possible combination of input fuzzy sets are then chosen as parameters to be optimized. In a proportional scaling method, these parameters are then transformed into real-coded chromosomes, over which arithmetical crossover and nonuniform mutation are implemented. Meanwhile, enlarged sampling space and a ranking mechanism are also be used in the evolution process. To show the application of the proposed method, a cart-centering example is given. From the simulation results, we find that the designed FLC is robust and can drive the cart system from any given initial state to the desired final state, which verifies the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.816466","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17619/00816466.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"109 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

This paper describes the application of neural network approach to the classification of a fully polarimetric SAR image.

The procedures are performed by interleaving the minimization of the total output error and the maximization of the correlation of the new inserted hidden unit with the residual error. While the training is stuck at a local minimum, it is possible that a useless unit will be permanently installed to the network.

The approach was obtained through extending ideas of three-phase instantaneous reactive power theory and constructing a two-phase system from the existing single-phase circuit. By theoretical and simulation analysis, it is shown to be a precise approach, which can be easily realized and has the merits of better steady state and dynamic performance than conventional approaches that could be used in single-phase circuits. The approach was applied into a hybrid active power filter, which combines a series active filter and a shunt passive filter together and aims at solving the harmonics problem originated by high-power single-phase nonlinear load. Following the system configuration and basic principles of the hybrid active power filter, the overall detection and control algorithm, the PWM generating technique and the DC voltage stabilizing method are introduced in detail. The detection and control algorithm were then realized by a digital control circuit with DSP processor, and successfully employed in a prototype hybrid active power filter. Experimental results on the prototype verified the effectiveness of the new detecting approach, the performance of the control circuit and the filtering characteristics of the hybrid active power filter.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1999.816519","publicationTitle":"IECON'99.

This filter can be successfully utilised for harmonic mitigation and reactive power compensation in electric power systems supplying nonlinear loads. An adaptive linear neural network is adopted for harmonic current detection and reference signal estimation. In addition, a sliding mode technique is used for maintaining sufficient tracking of reference. It controls the generation of PWM gating patterns required for the proper operation of a 3 phase voltage source converter. The APF is shunt connected to the point of common coupling (PCC) to supply the appropriate compensating currents. The integrity of the proposed scheme is fulfilled through digital simulation results. Moreover, the superiority of its performance is proved by comparison to other active filtering approaches. The results show an appreciable improvement in the source current waveforms and a near unity power factor operation is achieved. The presented control system of the APF exhibits robustness and a high dynamic response. The resultant enhancement in the system power quality is expressed by a unified index.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816524/","accessionNumber":"6522277","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-3 Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel three-phase active filter based on neural networks and sliding mode control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel three-phase active filter based on neural networks and sliding mode control","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00816524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035781S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6620","citationCount":"4","articleId":"816524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":816526,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, speed and position sensors require the additional mounting space, reduce the reliability in harsh environments and increase the cost of the motor. Various control algorithms have been proposed for the elimination of speed and position sensors. This paper investigates a novel speed sensorless control of an induction motor. The proposed control strategy is based on MRAS (model reference adaptive system) using state observer model with current error feedback and rotor current model as two models for flux estimation. The rotor speed is estimated so that the difference between the outputs of state observer model and rotor current model may be zero. This algorithm may overcome several shortages of conventional MRAS: integrator problems, small EMF at low speed, and relatively large sensitivity to resistance variation. The proposed algorithm is verified through simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1999.816537","pdfPath":"/iel5/6620/17670/00816537.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"938 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON'99.

Furthermore, we apply a neural network to the CBR system to deal with fuzzy values which represent colors. The neural network in the CBR system, however, must learn a new case incrementally without forgetting the learned instances. To realize this ability, we use a new incremental learning method proposed by the us to reduce the computational complexity for the learning. In the new method, the system learns the generalized radial cases function both the new case and some old cases that are predicted and being interfered by the learning.

The result gave appropriate combinations of colors that satisfied the user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/816554/","accessionNumber":"6521404","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Color coordination system on case based reasoning system using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color coordination system on case based reasoning system using neural network","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00816554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03981S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6569","citationCount":"3","articleId":"816554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":816567,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Image processing methods for generating a facial sketch based on the Hough transform are presented. Principles to generate a facial caricature and to evaluate the generated works are explained precisely, together with demonstrations of experimental results. In order to equip the PICASSO system for the feedback loop from the observer, we have introduced the eye camera system. This equipment is expected to provide a new method to extract the simultaneous individual eye-mark patterns which show where in the face the observer is watching. These preliminary experiments are also presented to show the possibility to extract more tightly individual KANSEI visual information.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.816567","pdfPath":"/iel5/6569/17619/00816567.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"299 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

In this study, a decision and control technique mimicking a skilled grower's decision process was proposed and then applied to the optimization of a fruit-storage process. It includes a fuzzy controller and two decision systems I and II consisting of neural networks and genetic algorithms to imitate the expert's manners. A skilled grower's decision process can be simplified into three steps: the construction of a mental model describing the input-output relation of an unknown system learning (\"Learning\"); the selection of the best strategy through simulation of the identified mental model (\"Selection\"); and the action of the best strategy in a highly skilled manner (\"Action\"). In the decision system I, fruit responses as affected by the relative humidity are first identified using neural networks (\"learning\") and then the optimal setpoints of the relative humidity are searched for through simulation of the identified model using genetic algorithms (\"selection\"). Furthermore, a fuzzy controller tuned optimally adjusts the relative humidity (\"action\"). The optimal setpoints of the relative humidity resulted in better qualities of fruits during storage. The fuzzy controller gave a better control performance of the relative humidity. It was found that a decision and control technique is useful for realizing the optimization of production systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1999.816592","startPage":"440","endPage":"445 vol.6","publicationTitle":"IEEE SMC'99 Conference Proceedings. 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The proposed method is based on parallel tabu search that considers the decomposition of the neighborhood into subneighborhoods and the multiple tabu lengths in tabu search. Capacitor placement is an important problem to maintain the voltage profile in distribution systems. The objective is to determine the location and size of shunt capacitors to be installed at nodes so that the transmission loss and installation cost are minimized. The problem is difficult to solve in the sense that it has high nonlinearity and handles both discrete and continuous variables. Compared with tabu search, the proposed method has a good performance in terms of solution accuracy and computational effort. As one of the meta-heuristics, it focuses on solutions near a global minimum rather than a local one. In that sense, it is expected that the proposed method reduces the cost function efficiently.

The current 802.11 standard already defines the basic rages of 1Mbit/s and 2 Mbit/s for both Frequency Hopping *FH) and Direct Sequence (DS) PHYs. The two rates are supported by having same header for both rates with length and rate information passed in the header at the lowest (\"basic\") rate; then the body of the packet is transmitted at the rate chosen and with the corresponding modulation method. The header structure of the two PHYs already supports passing rate information up to 4.5 Mbit/s (in 0.5 Mbit/s increments) for FH and up to 25.5 Mbit/s (in 0.1 Mbit/s increments) for DS. The proposed PAR targets further developing the provisions for enhanced data rate capability of 802.11 networks. The 802.11 MAC incorporates already the interpretation of this information and the computation of expected packet duration even if the specific station does not support the rate at which the packet was sent. The 802.11 MAC is compatible and will accommodate the higher PHY rates.","openAccessFlag":"F","icsCodes":[{"code":"35.100.10 35.110 35.100.20","term":"Physical layer      Networking      Data link layer"}],"title":"IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and Metropolitan networks - Specific requirements - Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: Higher Speed Physical Layer (PHY) Extension in the 2.4 GHz band","sourcePdf":"80211b-1999.pdf","content_type":"Standards","mlTime":"PT0.250401S","chronDate":"Jan. 20 2000","xplore-pub-id":"6642","isNumber":"17714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"standards","publicationNumber":"6642","citationCount":"6","articleId":"817038","contentTypeDisplay":"Standards","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"Standard Docs","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02","status":"superseded"},{"_id":817095,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The best of these methods involve motion compensating a number of video frames to produce the desired still. These motion compensated methods are formulated in the space-domain. More and more, however, the video source is only available in compressed format such as MPEG, H.263 or DV. In this case there is important compressed domain information that is not utilized by the formulation. Most notably, the quantization information from the bitstream is not correctly taken into account. We propose a motion-compensated, transform domain formulation for creating high quality video stills that directly incorporates transform domain quantization information. We apply this new formulation to MPEG compressed video and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to a reasonable space-domain approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-resolution image estimation for transform coded video with application to MPEG","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.817095","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17691/00817095.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"183 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.817095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Super-resolution image estimation for transform coded video with application to MPEG","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6521869","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-resolution image estimation for transform coded video with application to MPEG","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00817095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080421S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"14","articleId":"817095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":817108,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Thus far, the only definitive test for liver cancer is needle biopsy. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach using Hopfield neural network for the segmentation of color images of liver tissues prepared and stained by standard staining method. We formulate the segmentation problem as a minimization of an energy function synonymous to that of Hopfield neural network for the optimization, with the addition of some conditions to reach a status close to the global minimum in a prespecified time of convergence. Then we extract the nuclei and their corresponding cytoplasm regions which are used as a base for formulating the diagnostic rules of a computer aided diagnosis system for liver cancer. In computer, each liver color image is represented in the R-G-B, H-S-V and H-L-S color spaces and the segmentation results are comparatively presented with discussion and physician comments. Most of the data base of liver color images that we have collected have been successfully segmented with the exception of some images which were not stained carefully.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.817142","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17691/00817142.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"396 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.817142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation and analysis of liver cancer pathological color images based on artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation and analysis of liver cancer pathological color images based on artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6521913","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation and analysis of liver cancer pathological color images based on artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00817142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024528S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"4","articleId":"817142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":817158,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Motivated by this reasoning, we have performed a variety of tests using a global eigen approach developed previously, which has been modified to cope with the color information.

After self-embedding, it is possible to recover portions of the image that have been cropped out, replaced, damaged, or otherwise tampered without accessing the original image. The first method is based on transforming small 8/spl times/8 blocks using a DCT, quantizing the coefficients, and carefully encoding them in the least significant bits of other, distant squares. This method provides very high quality of reconstruction but it is very fragile. The quality of the reconstructed image areas is roughly equivalent to a 50% quality JPEG compressed original. The second method uses a principle similar to differential encoding to embed a circular shift of the original image with decreased color depth into the original image. The quality of the reconstructed image gradually degrades with increasing amount of noise in the tampered image. The first technique can also be used as a fragile watermark for image authentication, while the second technique can be classified as a semi-robust watermark.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17691/00817228.pdf","startPage":"792","endPage":"796 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.817228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.817228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Images with self-correcting capabilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image coding","Watermarking","Protection","Discrete cosine transforms","Encoding","Transform coding","Colored noise","Degradation","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","encoding","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-correcting capabilities","self-embedding","image content","discrete cosine transform","encoding","watermark","image authentication","semi-robust watermark"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Images with self-correcting capabilities","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6521996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Images with self-correcting capabilities","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00817228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034688S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"87","articleId":"817228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":817235,"authors":[{"name":"V.A.

Typically, the points are surface samples acquired with multiple range scans of an object. The principle of the BPA is very simple: Three points form a triangle if a ball of a user-specified radius p touches them without containing any other point. Starting with a seed triangle, the ball pivots around an edge (i.e., it revolves around the edge while keeping in contact with the edge's endpoints) until it touches another point, forming another triangle. The process continues until all reachable edges have been tried, and then starts from another seed triangle, until all points have been considered. The process can then be repeated with a ball of larger radius to handle uneven sampling densities. We applied the BPA to datasets of millions of points representing actual scans of complex 3D objects. The relatively small amount of memory required by the BPA, its time efficiency, and the quality of the results obtained compare favorably with existing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1999","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6491211","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ball-pivoting algorithm for surface reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00817351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040203S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"567","articleId":"817351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817359,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The presented DSC scheme develops a new torque control methodology that does not require any position transducer to synchronize the stator current vector with the rotor. Such a control strategy differs from the conventional DSC approach in order to fit some specific requirements of synchronous reluctance (SyncRel) machines. First, torque and rotor position are controlled instead of torque and stator flux as in a conventional DSC scheme. Second, the operating sector is selected according to the actual position of the current vector rather than the position of the stator flux. The proposed methodology allows simplifying implementation of the torque control on SyncRel drives and reducing the global cost for medium-performance electric drives. Simulations and experimental tests on a 1.5-kW motor drive are provided to evaluate the consistency and the performance of the proposed control technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6486890","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless torque control of SyncRel motor drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless torque control of SyncRel motor drives","sourcePdf":"00817359.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045536S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"20","articleId":"817359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817363,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

We continue by providing conditions for noise-free channels, under which VCM admits stable minima corresponding to zero-forcing (ZF) channel receivers.

The settling time is crucial for both simulation and applications of VLSI CNN chips. The computational effort for the numerical integration may be drastically reduced, and CNN programs can be optimized, if a priori knowledge on the settling time is available. For the class of uncoupled CNN's, we present exact analytic solutions, while for propagation-type tasks, tight upper bounds are given. Since the accuracy of template parameter values on a VLSI chip is limited, the effective values may deviate considerably from the nominal values which, in turn, substantially influences the settling time. This influence can be quantified with the help of sensitivity theory. Furthermore, to operate reliably, a template must be jointly optimized for speed and robustness. For uncoupled templates this is readily possible, while for propagating-type tasks, a tradeoff between speed and robustness is the best that can be accomplished. However, considering a sufficient degree of robustness as a constraint rather than as an objective, it is possible to design optimally fast templates analytically.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/81/17722/00817383.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of CNN settling time","doi":"10.1109/81.817383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.817383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of CNN settling time","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6487949","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of CNN settling time","sourcePdf":"00817383.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051683S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"9","articleId":"817383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":817385,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The problems subsequent to its use in real-time operations are then set out so as to motivate the idea of synthesizing it by a recursive distribution of zeros and poles. An analysis of the existing work is also proposed to support this idea. A comprehensive study is given of the synthesis of differentiators with integer, noninteger, real or complex orders, and whose action is limited to any given frequency bandwidth. First, a definition, in the operational and frequency domains, of a frequency-band complex noninteger order differentiator, is given in a mathematical space with four dimensions which is a Banach algebra. Then, the determination of its synthesized form, by a recursive distribution of complex zeros and poles characterized by complex recursive factors, is presented. The complex noninteger differentiation order is expressed as a function of these recursive factors. The number of zeros and poles is calculated to be as low as possible while still ensuring the stability of the synthesized differentiator to be synthesized. A time validation is presented. Finally, guidelines are proposed for the conception of the synthesized differentiator.","doi":"10.1109/81.817385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.817385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/81/17722/00817385.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-band complex noninteger differentiator: characterization and synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-band complex noninteger differentiator: characterization and synthesis","volume":"47","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6487950","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817385/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-band complex noninteger differentiator: characterization and synthesis","sourcePdf":"00817385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043502S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"1033","articleId":"817385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":817393,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

Additionally, data and instruction caches are not always used efficiently, resulting in large numbers of cache misses. Therefore, the importance of cache performance improvements at each level of the memory hierarchy will continue to grow. In numeric programs, there are several known compiler techniques for optimizing data cache performance. However, integer (nonnumeric) programs often have irregular access patterns that are more difficult for the compiler to optimize. In the past, cache management techniques such as cache bypassing were implemented manually at the machine-language-programming level. As the available chip area grows, it makes sense to spend more resources to allow intelligent control over the cache management. In this paper, we present an approach to improving cache effectiveness, taking advantage of the growing chip area, utilizing run-time adaptive cache management techniques, optimizing both performance and cost of implementation. Specifically, we are aiming to increase data cache effectiveness for integer programs. We propose a microarchitecture scheme where the hardware determines data placement within the cache hierarchy based on dynamic referencing behavior. This scheme is fully compatible with existing instruction set architectures. This paper examines the theoretical upper bounds on the cache hit ratio that cache bypassing can provide for integer applications, including several Windows applications with OS activity. Then, detailed trace-driven simulations of the integer applications are used to show that the implementation described in this paper can achieve performance close to that of the upper bound.","doi":"10.1109/12.817393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17716/00817393.pdf","startPage":"1338","endPage":"1354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.817393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-time cache bypassing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Run-time cache bypassing","volume":"48","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6486093","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817393/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-time cache bypassing","sourcePdf":"00817393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076073S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"56","articleId":"817393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":817395,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

We claim that the problem of dialog design can be formalized as an optimization problem with an objective function reflecting different dialog dimensions relevant for a given application. We also show that any dialog system can be formally described as a sequential decision process in terms of its state space, action set, and strategy. With additional assumptions about the state transition probabilities and cost assignment, a dialog system can be mapped to a stochastic model known as Markov decision process (MDP). A variety of data driven algorithms for finding the optimal strategy (i.e., the one that optimizes the criterion) is available within the MDP framework, based on reinforcement learning. For an effective use of the available training data we propose a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning: the supervised learning is used to estimate a model of the user, i.e., the MDP parameters that quantify the user's behavior. Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to estimate the optimal strategy while the system interacts with the simulated user. This approach is tested for learning the strategy in an air travel information system (ATIS) task. The experimental results we present in this paper show that it is indeed possible to find a simple criterion, a state space representation, and a simulated user parameterization in order to automatically learn a relatively complex dialog behavior, similar to one that was heuristically designed by several research groups.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17730/00817450.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.817450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.817450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic model of human-machine interaction for learning dialog strategies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Man machine systems","State-space methods","Design optimization","Costs","Stochastic systems","Training data","Supervised learning","System testing","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive systems","optimisation","probability","Markov processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","travel industry","information systems","decision theory","speech recognition","natural language interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic model","human-machine interaction","dialog strategies","quantitative model","dialog systems","optimization problem","sequential decision process","state transition probabilities","cost assignment","Markov decision process","optimal strategy","reinforcement learning","supervised learning","air travel information system","experiment","state space representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic model of human-machine interaction for learning dialog strategies","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6474569","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic model of human-machine interaction for learning dialog strategies","sourcePdf":"00817450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109357S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"222","articleId":"817450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817451,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Several smoothing methods for ME models have been proposed to address this problem, but previous results do not make it clear how these smoothing methods compare with smoothing methods for other types of related models. In this work, we survey previous work in ME smoothing and compare the performance of several of these algorithms with conventional techniques for smoothing n-gram language models. Because of the mature body of research in n-gram model smoothing and the close connection between ME and conventional n-gram models, this domain is well-suited to gauge the performance of ME smoothing methods. Over a large number of data sets, we find that fuzzy ME smoothing performs as well as or better than all other algorithms under consideration. We contrast this method with previous n-gram smoothing methods to explain its superior performance.","doi":"10.1109/89.817452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.817452","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17730/00817452.pdf","startPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of smoothing techniques for ME models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817452/","displayDocTitle":"A survey of smoothing techniques for ME models","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6474571","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of smoothing techniques for ME models","sourcePdf":"00817452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046665S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"86","articleId":"817452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817453,"authors":[{"name":"B.

They include tasks from the travel domain and automatic switchboards as well as large scale directory assistance. The overall goal in developing spoken dialog systems is to allow for a natural and flexible dialog flow similar to human-human interaction. This imposes the challenging task to recognize and interpret user input, where he/she is allowed to choose from an unrestricted vocabulary and an infinite set of possible formulations. We therefore put emphasis on strategies that make the system more robust while still maintaining a high level of naturalness and flexibility. In view of this paradigm, we found that two fundamental principles characterize many of the proposed methods: to consider available sources of information as early as possible; and to keep alternative hypotheses and delay the decision for a single option as long as possible. We describe how our system architecture caters to incorporating application specific knowledge, including, for example, database constraints, in the determination of the best sentence hypothesis for a user turn. On the next higher level, we use the dialog history to assess the plausibility of a sentence hypothesis by applying consistency checks with information items from previous user turns. In particular, we demonstrate how combination decisions over several turns can be exploited to boost the recognition performance of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The thoughtful elephant: strategies for spoken dialog systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.817453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17730/00817453.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.817453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"The thoughtful elephant: strategies for spoken dialog systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6474572","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The thoughtful elephant: strategies for spoken dialog systems","sourcePdf":"00817453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13986S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"24","articleId":"817453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":817455,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

It was recently proposed to capture global constraints through the use of latent semantic analysis, while taking local constraints into account via the usual n-gram approach. This has led to several families of data-driven, multispan language models for large vocabulary speech recognition. Because of the inherent complementarity in the two types of constraints, the multispan performance, as measured by perplexity, has been shown to compare favorably with the corresponding n-gram performance. The objective of this work is to characterize the behavior of such multispan modeling in actual recognition. Major implementation issues are addressed, including search integration and context scope selection. Experiments are conducted on a subset of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speaker-independent, 20000-word vocabulary, continuous speech task. Results show that, compared to standard n-gram, the multispan framework can lead to a reduction in average word error rate of over 20%. The paper concludes with a discussion of intrinsic multi-span tradeoffs, such as the influence of training data selection on the resulting performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large vocabulary speech recognition with multispan statistical language models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","doi":"10.1109/89.817455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/89/17730/00817455.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.817455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817455/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Large vocabulary speech recognition with multispan statistical language models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6474574","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large vocabulary speech recognition with multispan statistical language models","sourcePdf":"00817455.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054494S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"37","articleId":"817455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817457,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These excellent characteristics are the same as those of a previously reported OWS fabricated using PLC-PLC direct attachment.","doi":"10.1109/68.817461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/17720/00817461.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.817461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact optical wavelength selector composed of arrayed-waveguide gratings and an optical gate array integrated on a single PLC platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817461/","displayDocTitle":"A compact optical wavelength selector composed of arrayed-waveguide gratings and an optical gate array integrated on a single PLC platform","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6473488","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact optical wavelength selector composed of arrayed-waveguide gratings and an optical gate array integrated on a single PLC platform","sourcePdf":"00817461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044696S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"9","articleId":"817461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":817463,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The formulation is based on a suitable translation operator modeling, in time domain, the propagation in a uniform hollow waveguide. By applying this operator, a multimodal absorbing boundary condition is obtained. Moreover, a source algorithm is developed that generates a given incident wave, while absorbing each modal component reflected from a discontinuity. The source is capable of separating incident and reflected waves without requiring any presimulation of long uniform waveguides. The validity and effectiveness of the formulation is verified by means of three numerical experiments. The first two refer to waveguide discontinuities. In these cases, the FDTD results are compared to mode-matching results. The third example is a transition from waveguide to printed circuit transmission line. The numerical simulation is compared with published experimental results. The presented examples show that the generalized scattering matrix of a waveguide circuit can be evaluated accurately in the smallest computational space allowed by the structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A revised formulation of modal absorbing and matched modal source boundary conditions for the efficient FDTD analysis of waveguide structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.817471","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17731/00817471.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.817471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"A revised formulation of modal absorbing and matched modal source boundary conditions for the efficient FDTD analysis of waveguide structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6486023","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A revised formulation of modal absorbing and matched modal source boundary conditions for the efficient FDTD analysis of waveguide structures","sourcePdf":"00817471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048746S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","articleId":"817471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817476,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Following the derivation of the input-output weight enumeration functions of the ensembles of random parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes, the tangential sphere upper bound is employed to provide improved upper bounds on the block and bit error probabilities of these ensembles of codes for the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, based on coherent detection of equi-energy antipodal signals and maximum-likelihood decoding. The influence of the interleaver length and the memory length of the component codes is investigated. The improved bounding technique proposed here is compared to the conventional union bound and to a alternative bounding technique by Duman and Salehi (1998) which incorporates modified Gallager bounds. The advantage of the derived bounds is demonstrated for a variety of parallel and serial concatenated coding schemes with either fixed or random recursive systematic convolutional component codes, and it is especially pronounced in the region exceeding the cutoff rate, where the performance of turbo codes is most appealing. These upper bounds are also compared to simulation results of the iterative decoding algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/18.817506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.817506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17721/00817506.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"47","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved upper bounds on the ML decoding error probability of parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes via their ensemble distance spectrum","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Improved upper bounds on the ML decoding error probability of parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes via their ensemble distance spectrum","volume":"46","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6485989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817506/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved upper bounds on the ML decoding error probability of parallel and serial concatenated turbo codes via their ensemble distance spectrum","sourcePdf":"00817506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073415S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"61","articleId":"817506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":817509,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We furthermore show that conventional performance parameters, such as error-correction radius and effective error coefficient, do not capture the essential geometric features of a GMD decoding region, and thus do not provide a meaningful measure of performance. As an alternative, probabilistic estimates of, and upper bounds upon, the performance of GMD decoding are developed. Furthermore, extensive simulation results, for both low-dimensional and high-dimensional sphere-packings, are presented. These simulations show that multilevel codes in conjunction with multistage GMD decoding provide significant coding gains at a very low complexity.

The utility of Golay complementary sequences in solving this problem has been recognized for some time. In this paper, a powerful theory linking Golay complementary sets of polyphase sequences and Reed-Muller codes is developed. Our main result shows that any second-order coset of a q-ary generalization of the first order Reed-Muller code can be partitioned into Golay complementary sets whose size depends only on a single parameter that is easily computed from a graph associated with the coset. As a first consequence, recent results of Davis and Jedwab (see Electron.

As a second consequence, the main result directly yields bounds on the PMEPRs of codes formed from selected cosets of the generalized first order Reed-Muller code. These codes enjoy efficient encoding, good error-correcting capability, and tightly controlled PMEPR, and significantly extend the range of coding options for applications of OFDM using small numbers of carriers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","volume":"46","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6485995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Reed-Muller codes and power control in OFDM modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Reed-Muller codes and power control in OFDM modulation","sourcePdf":"00817512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117366S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"276","articleId":"817512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":817513,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In such systems, coded information is transmitted over a small number of fading channels in order to achieve diversity. Bounds on the achievable performance due to coding are derived using information-theoretic techniques.

An error analysis reveals that the usual method of fixed-point computation of FFTs of vectors of length 2/sup l/ leads to an average loss of l/2 bits of precision. This phenomenon, often referred to as computational noise, causes major problems for arithmetic units with limited precision which are often used for real-time applications. Several researchers have noted that calculation of FFTs with algebraic integers avoids computational noise entirely. We combine a new algorithm for approximating complex numbers by cyclotomic integers with Chinese remaindering strategies to give an efficient algorithm to compute b-bit precision FFTs of length L. More precisely, we approximate complex numbers by cyclotomic integers in Z[e(2/spl pi/i/2/sup n/)] whose coefficients, when expressed as polynomials in e(2/spl pi/i/2/sup n/), are bounded in absolute value by some integer M. For fixed n our algorithm runs in time O(log(M)), and produces an approximation with worst case error of O(1/M(2/sup n-2/-1)). We prove that this algorithm has optimal worst case error by proving a corresponding lower bound on the worst case error of any approximation algorithm for this task. The main tool for designing the algorithms is the use of the cyclotomic units, a subgroup of finite index in the unit group of the cyclotomic field. First implementations of our algorithms indicate that they are fast enough to be used for the design of low-cost high-speed/high-precision FFT chips.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17721/00817519.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.817519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.817519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17721","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and precise Fourier transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","signal processing","error analysis","residue number systems","computational complexity","approximation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precise Fourier transforms","fast Fourier transforms","FFT","computer tomography","geophysical signal processing","high-resolution imaging radar","prediction filters","high-precision output","error analysis","fixed-point computation","vector length","average loss","computational noise","arithmetic units","real-time applications","algebraic integers","complex numbers approximation","cyclotomic integers","Chinese remaindering strategies","efficient algorithm","complex numbers","coefficients","polynomials","digital signal processing","optimal worst case error","lower bound","approximation algorithm","subgroup","finite index","low-cost high-speed FFT chips","high-precision FFT chips"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Fast and precise Fourier transforms","volume":"46","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6486002","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and precise Fourier transforms","sourcePdf":"00817519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063239S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","articleId":"817519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":817522,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

(The case l=1 corresponds to classical decoding of up to [(n-k)/2] errors where the decoding ends with at most one codeword.) This improves on the time complexity O(n/sup 3/) needed for solving the equations of Sudan's algorithm by a naive Gaussian elimination.

We describe three major contributions. (i) First, by modeling the noise as a finite-order Markov process, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) and the optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence detector extending to the correlated noise case the Viterbi algorithm. We show that, when the signal-dependent noise is conditionally Gauss-Markov, the branch metrics in the MLSD are computed from the conditional second-order noise statistics. We evaluate the branch metrics using a bank of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. (ii) Second, we characterize the error performance of the MLSD and MAP sequence detector. The error analysis of these detectors is complicated by the correlation asymmetry of the channel noise. We derive upper and lower bounds and computationally efficient approximations to these bounds based on the banded structure of the inverses of Gauss-Markov covariance matrices. An experimental study shows the tightness of these bounds. (iii) Finally, we derive several classes of suboptimal sequence detectors, and demonstrate how these and others available in the literature relate to the MLSD. We compare their error rate performance and their relative computational complexity, and show how the structure of the MLSD and the performance evaluation guide us in choosing a best compromise between several types of suboptimal sequence detectors.","doi":"10.1109/18.817531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.817531","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/17721/00817531.pdf","startPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Viterbi algorithm and Markov noise memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817531/","displayDocTitle":"The Viterbi algorithm and Markov noise memory","volume":"46","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6486014","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Viterbi algorithm and Markov noise memory","sourcePdf":"00817531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047458S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"112","articleId":"817531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817532,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is shown that by using two levels of correlated-double sampling it is possible to effectively cancel all fixed-pattern noise due to read-out circuit mismatch. Instead the fixed-pattern noise performance of the sensor is limited by dark current nonuniformity at low signal levels, and conversion gain nonuniformity at high signal levels. It is further shown that the imaging performance of the sensor is comparable to low-end CCD sensors but inferior to that reported for high-end CCD sensors due to low quantum efficiency, high dark current, and pixel cross-talk. As such the performance of CMOS sensors is limited at the device level rather than at the architectural level. If the imaging performance issues can be addressed at the fabrication process level without increasing cost or degrading transistor performance, CMOS has the potential to seriously challenge CCD as the solid-state imaging technology of choice due to low power dissipation and compatibility with camera system integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817567/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6472155","volume":"47","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a color CMOS photogate image sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a color CMOS photogate image sensor","sourcePdf":"00817567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070413S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"44","articleId":"817567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817574,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Interconnects are modeled as effective resistances and capacitances to match the distributed transmission behavior. The new model shows excellent agreement with SPICE simulations. Further, while existing models do not support the multiple line crosstalk behaviors, our model can be generalized to multiple lines. That is, unlike previously published work, even if the geometrical structures are not identical, it can accurately predict crosstalk. The model is experimentally verified with 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS process-based interconnect test structures. The new model can be readily implemented in CAD analysis tools.

Better immunity from measurement noise is achieved by avoiding numerical differentiation of data. The technique is employed to study the temporal buildup of damage profiles for a variety of stress conditions. The nature of the generated damage and trends in its position are qualitatively estimated from the internal electric field distributions obtained from device simulations.

The ballistic transconductance in the limit that the oxide thickness approaches zero is also examined. The results show that as the channel length approaches zero (which corresponds to the ballistic limit), the on-current and transconductance approach finite limiting values and the channel resistance approaches a finite minimum value. The source velocity can be as high as about 1.5/spl times/10/sup 7/ cm/s. The limiting on-current and transconductance are considerably higher than those deduced experimentally by a previous study of MOSFETs with channel lengths greater than 0.2 /spl mu/m.

In addition, this document presents the rationale, design and results of psychophysical experiments that were conducted to address some key issues that arose during PicHunter's development. The PicHunter project makes four primary contributions to research on CBIR. First, PicHunter represents a simple instance of a general Bayesian framework which we describe for using relevance feedback to direct a search. With an explicit model of what users would do, given the target image they want, PicHunter uses Bayes's rule to predict the target they want, given their actions. This is done via a probability distribution over possible image targets, rather than by refining a query. Second, an entropy-minimizing display algorithm is described that attempts to maximize the information obtained from a user at each iteration of the search. Third, PicHunter makes use of hidden annotation rather than a possibly inaccurate/inconsistent annotation structure that the user must learn and make queries in. Finally, PicHunter introduces two experimental paradigms to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the system, and psychophysical experiments are presented that support the theoretical claims.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6473906","pubMedId":"18255370","volume":"9","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Bayesian image retrieval system, PicHunter: theory, implementation, and psychophysical experiments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Bayesian image retrieval system, PicHunter: theory, implementation, and psychophysical experiments","sourcePdf":"00817596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061978S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"412","articleId":"817596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817597,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The central idea is that similarity judgment has to be modeled along perceptual dimensions. Hence, we detect basic visual categories that people use in their judgment of similarity, and design a computational model that accepts patterns as input and, depending on the query, produces a set of choices that follow human behavior in pattern matching. There are two major research aspects to our work. The first one addresses the issue of how humans perceive and measure similarity within the domain of color patterns. To understand and describe this mechanism, we performed a subjective experiment which yielded five perceptual criteria used in comparison between color patterns (vocabulary), as well as a set of rules governing the use of these criteria in similarity judgment (grammar). The second research aspect is the implementation of the perceptual criteria and rules in an image retrieval system. Following the processing typical for human vision, we design a system to: (1) extract perceptual features from the vocabulary and (2) perform the comparison between the patterns according to the grammar rules. The modeling of human perception of color patterns is new - starting with a new color codebook design, compact color representation, and texture description through multi-scale edge distribution along different directions. Moreover, we propose new color and texture distance functions that correlate with human performance. The performance of the system is illustrated with numerous examples from image databases from different application domains.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17727/00817597.pdf","doi":"10.1109/83.817597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.817597","startPage":"38","endPage":"54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching and retrieval based on the vocabulary and grammar of color patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817597/","displayDocTitle":"Matching and retrieval based on the vocabulary and grammar of color patterns","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6473907","pubMedId":"18255371","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching and retrieval based on the vocabulary and grammar of color patterns","sourcePdf":"00817597.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050303S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"116","articleId":"817597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817598,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The DCT is applied in blocks of 8/spl times/8 pixels, as in the JPEG algorithm. The watermark can encode information to track illegal misuses. For flexibility purposes, the original image is not necessary during the ownership verification process, so it must be modeled by noise. Two tests are involved in the ownership verification stage: watermark decoding, in which the message carried by the watermark is extracted, and watermark detection, which decides whether a given image contains a watermark generated with a certain key. We apply generalized Gaussian distributions to statistically model the DCT coefficients of the original image and show how the resulting detector structures lead to considerable improvements in performance with respect to the correlation receiver, which has been widely considered in the literature and makes use of the Gaussian noise assumption.

The proposed system aims at detecting the presence of abandoned objects in a guarded environment and at automatically performing online semantic video segmentation in order to facilitate the human operator's task of retrieving the cause of an alarm. The former task is performed by operating image segmentation based on temporal rank-order filtering, followed by classification in order to reduce false alarms. The latter task is performed by operating temporal video segmentation when an alarm is detected. In the clips of interest, the key frame is the one depicting a person leaving a dangerous object, and is determined on the basis of a feature indicating the movement around the dangerous region. Experimental results are reported in terms of static region detection, classification, clip and key-frame detection errors versus different levels of complexity of the guarded environment, in order to establish the performance that can be expected from the system in different situations.","doi":"10.1109/83.817599","startPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17727/00817599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.817599","endPage":"79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time video-shot detection for scene surveillance applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Real-time video-shot detection for scene surveillance applications","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6473909","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","pubMedId":"18255373","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time video-shot detection for scene surveillance applications","sourcePdf":"00817599.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060272S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"95","articleId":"817599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817600,"authors":[{"name":"Linhui Jia","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Machine Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Linhui Jia","id":"37087356406"},{"name":"L.

To this end, color models are proposed independent of the object geometry, object pose, and illumination. From these color models, color invariant edges are derived from which shape invariant features are computed. Computational methods are described to combine the color and shape invariants into a unified high-dimensional invariant feature set for discriminatory object retrieval. Experiments have been conducted on a database consisting of 500 images taken from multicolored man-made objects in real world scenes. From the theoretical and experimental results it is concluded that object retrieval based on composite color and shape invariant features provides excellent retrieval accuracy. Object retrieval based on color invariants provides very high retrieval accuracy whereas object retrieval based entirely on shape invariants yields poor discriminative power. Furthermore, the image retrieval scheme is highly robust to partial occlusion, object clutter and a change in the object's pose. Finally, the image retrieval scheme is integrated into the PicToSeek system on-line at http://www.wins.uva.nl/research/isis/PicToSeek/ for searching images on the World Wide Web.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817602/","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6481194","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18255376","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"PicToSeek: combining color and shape invariant features for image retrieval","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PicToSeek: combining color and shape invariant features for image retrieval","sourcePdf":"00817602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095144S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"307","articleId":"817602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817604,"authors":[{"name":"Chengjun Liu","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, US"],"lastName":"Chengjun Liu","id":"37087190500"},{"name":"H.

We further constructed a tree scheme to represent those interacting activities across scales, Using the bandpass filter property of the DWT in the frequency domain, we also characterized the band-related activities by calculating energy in respective rhythmic bands. Moreover, since there is a fast and easily implemented algorithm for the DWT. This new approach may simplify the signal processing and provide a more efficient and complete study of the temporal-frequency dynamics of the CTS.

This system operating at 1150 MHz or 450 MHz can detect the breathing and heartbeat signals of human subjects through an earthquake rubble or a construction barrier of about 10-ft thickness. The basic physical principle for the operation of a microwave life-detection system is rather simple. When a microwave beam of appropriate frequency (L or S band) is aimed at a pile of earthquake rubble covering a human subject or illuminated through a barrier obstructing a human subject, the microwave beam can penetrate the rubble or the barrier to reach the human subject. When the human subject is illuminated by a microwave beam, the reflected wave from the human subject will be modulated by tile subject's body movements, which include the breathing and the heartbeat. If the clutter consisting of the reflected wave from stationary background can be completely eliminated and the reflected wave from the human subject's body is properly modulated, the breathing and heartbeat signals of the subject can be extracted. Thus, a human subject buried under earthquake rubble or hidden behind barriers can be located. This system has been tested extensively in a simulated earthquake rubble in the laboratory and also in a field test using realistic earthquake rubble conducted by a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Task Force.","doi":"10.1109/10.817625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17726/00817625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.817625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17726","startPage":"105","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave life-detection systems for searching human subjects under earthquake rubble or behind barrier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microwave life-detection systems for searching human subjects under earthquake rubble or behind barrier","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817625/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6479234","pubMedId":"10646285","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave life-detection systems for searching human subjects under earthquake rubble or behind barrier","sourcePdf":"00817625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"310","articleId":"817625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817627,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A large number of clinical tests have shown the very good performance of the phonocardiographic method in comparison with FHR curves simultaneously recorded with ultrasound cardiotocography. Indeed, approximately 90% of the time, the acoustic FHR curve remained inside a /spl plusmn/3 beats/min tolerance limit of the reference ultrasound method. The confidence was typically CF>0.85.

Different from the direct chaotic masking methods, the chaotic carrier wave is generated from different chaotic states in transience instead of a fixed chaotic state in static to prevent it from being reproduced through a reconstructed embedding phase space. The testing digital and sinusoidal message signals in the gigahertz range can be easily recovered without the use of any electronic or optical filter to filter out the synchronization error. The robustness of synchronization is examined by using the intrinsic white noise of the transmitter and the receiver as the perturbation. The effects of parameter mismatches on the quality and robustness of synchronization are analyzed in detail. The results show that different internal parameters have very different tolerances for parameter mismatch. A short discussion on the phase sensitivity of synchronization is also given.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-loop chaotic synchronization of injection-locked semiconductor lasers with gigahertz range modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.817635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/17725/00817635.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.817635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Open-loop chaotic synchronization of injection-locked semiconductor lasers with gigahertz range modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6486113","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-loop chaotic synchronization of injection-locked semiconductor lasers with gigahertz range modulation","sourcePdf":"00817635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157851S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"108","articleId":"817635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817641,"authors":[{"name":"X.S.

A maximum efficiency of 58/spl plusmn/5% has been measured and the radiation patterns show a measured front-to-back ratio of -10 dB at 94 GHz. The measured mutual coupling is below -20 dB in both E- and H-plane directions due to the integration of small 50-/spl mu/m silicon beams between the antennas.

To this end, the concept of external substrate perforation is applied to patch antennas in this paper. The goal was to overcome the undesirable features of thick and high dielectric constant substrates for patch antennas without sacrificing any of the desired features, namely, small element size and bandwidth. The idea is to use substrate perforation exterior to the patch to lower the effective dielectric constant of the substrate surrounding the patch. This change in the effective dielectric constant has been observed to help mitigate the unwanted interference pattern of edge diffraction/scattering and leaky waves. The numerical data presented in this paper were generated using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique. Using this numerical method, a patch antenna was simulated on finite-sized ground planes of two different substrate thicknesses, with and without external substrate perforation. The computations showed the directivity drop in the radiation pattern caused by substrate propagation was noticeably improved by introducing the substrate perforation external to the patch for the case of a patch antenna on a relatively thick substrate without any loss of bandwidth. Measurements of a few patch antennas fabricated on high dielectric constant substrates with and without substrate perforation are included for completeness. Good correlation between the computed results and measurements is observed.","doi":"10.1109/8.817654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.817654","endPage":"1794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17732/00817654.pdf","startPage":"1785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch antennas on externally perforated high dielectric constant substrates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817654/","displayDocTitle":"Patch antennas on externally perforated high dielectric constant substrates","volume":"47","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"6501115","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch antennas on externally perforated high dielectric constant substrates","sourcePdf":"00817654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034555S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"200","articleId":"817654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":817655,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

First, a study is made to select a short pulse to radiate that is most appropriate for the problem. A simple one-dimensional (1-D) analysis of some representative soils and a land mine is used to select a radiated pulse similar in shape to a differentiated Gaussian pulse with a spectral peak at 4 GHz. Based on previous studies, the conductivity of the arms of the Vee dipole is linearly tapered from the feed to the open ends. A fully three-dimensional (3-D) finite-difference time domain (FDTD) model is developed and used to simulate the GPR land mine detection problem. Using this model, a resistively loaded Vee dipole is selected and evaluated. Parametric studies related to the problem are conducted including: varying the height of the Vee above the ground, varying the position of the land mine both laterally and in depth, and examining the effects of the geometry of the land mine on the received signal. Environmental conditions are examined including signal returns from rocks and variations in the shape of the surface of the ground. The FDTD results are validated by comparisons with experimental data. These studies demonstrate that resistively loaded Vee dipoles can greatly reduce clutter related to the antenna, making the task of distinguishing land mines (targets) much easier.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Land mine detection using a ground-penetrating radar based on resistively loaded Vee dipoles","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.817655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17732/00817655.pdf","startPage":"1795","endPage":"1806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.817655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Land mine detection using a ground-penetrating radar based on resistively loaded Vee dipoles","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6501116","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Land mine detection using a ground-penetrating radar based on resistively loaded Vee dipoles","sourcePdf":"00817655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050413S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"93","articleId":"817655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817659,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

Massively thinned arrays have fewer than half the elements of their filled counterparts. Such drastic thinning is normally accompanied by loss of sidelobe control. This paper describes a class of massively thinned linear and planar arrays that show well-behaved sidelobes in spite of the thinning. The term isophoric is derived from Greek roots to denote uniform weight. In isophoric arrays, element placement based on difference sets forces uniformly weighted spatial coverage. This constraint forces the array power pattern to pass through V uniformly spaced, equal, and constant values that are less than 1/K times the main beam peak, where V is the aperture size in half-wavelengths and K is the number of elements in the array. The net result is reduced peak sidelobes, especially when compared to cut-and-try random-placement approaches. An isophoric array will exhibit this sidelobe control even when the array has been thinned to the extent that K is approximately the square root of V. Where more than one beam must be generated at a time, isophoric array designs may be used to advantage even within a traditional filled array. By \"interweaving\" two isophoric subarrays within a filled array and by appropriate cyclic shifting of the element assignments over time, two independent antenna power patterns can be generated, each with a sidelobe region that is approximately a constant value of 1/(2K) relative to the main beam, where K is the number of elements in the subarray.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17732/00817659.pdf","startPage":"1825","endPage":"1835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.817659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.817659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isophoric arrays-massively thinned phased arrays with well-controlled sidelobes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Lattices","Apertures","Antenna arrays","Planar arrays","Sampling methods","Linear antenna arrays","Power generation","Costs","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","planar antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","linear antenna arrays","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isophoric arrays","massively thinned phased arrays","well-controlled sidelobes","uniform lattice","half-wavelength spacing","antenna elements","planar arrays","array power pattern","element placement","difference sets","uniformly weighted spatial coverage","isophoric subarrays interweaving","cyclic shifting","antenna power patterns","sidelobe region","linear arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Isophoric arrays-massively thinned phased arrays with well-controlled sidelobes","volume":"47","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6501120","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isophoric arrays-massively thinned phased arrays with well-controlled sidelobes","sourcePdf":"00817659.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029541S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"127","articleId":"817659","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":817660,"authors":[{"name":"B.G.

Antenna system sidelobes levels were lower with the stepped lens while the cross-polarization levels were comparable.","doi":"10.1109/8.817660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17732/00817660.pdf","startPage":"1836","endPage":"1842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.817660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-polarized slot-coupled patch antennas on Duroid with teflon lenses for 76.5-GHz automotive radar systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817660/","displayDocTitle":"Dual-polarized slot-coupled patch antennas on Duroid with teflon lenses for 76.5-GHz automotive radar systems","volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6501121","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-polarized slot-coupled patch antennas on Duroid with teflon lenses for 76.5-GHz automotive radar systems","sourcePdf":"00817660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04464S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"48","articleId":"817660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":817691,"authors":[{"name":"In-Cheol Baik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea","Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Daejeon, KR"],"lastName":"In-Cheol Baik","id":"37087210634"},{"name":"Kyeong-Hwa Kim","lastName":"Kyeong-Hwa Kim","id":"37086966769"},{"name":"Myung-Joong Youn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung-Joong Youn","id":"37087145342"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"817691","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":218,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2281},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Velocity control","Synchronous motors","Sliding mode control","PD control","Linear feedback control systems","Pi control","Proportional control","Digital signal processors","Permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable structure systems","velocity control","feedback","two-term control","robust control","nonlinear control systems","machine control","synchronous motors","permanent magnet motors","motion control","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP-based robust nonlinear speed control","PM synchronous motor","boundary layer integral sliding mode control","quasi-linearized decoupled model","input-output feedback linearization","proportional plus derivative controller","PD controller"]}],"abstract":"A digital signal processor (DSP)-based robust nonlinear speed control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is presented.

There is, therefore, a need to systematically investigate the problem of controlling the water level in the steam generator in order to prevent such costly reactor shutdowns.

It is very difficult to assure such accuracy due to many factors affecting the precision of motion, such as frictions and disturbances in the drive system. The standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type servo control algorithms are not capable of delivering the desired precision under the influence of frictions and disturbances. In this paper, the frictions are identified by a neural net, which has a critic element to measure the system performance. Then, the weight adaptation rule, defined as reinforcement adaptive learning, is derived from the Lyapunov stability theory. Therefore the proposed scheme can be applicable to a wide class of mechanical systems. The simulation results on a 1-degree-of-freedom mechanical system verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6474599","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement adaptive learning neural-net-based friction compensation control for high speed and precision","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement adaptive learning neural-net-based friction compensation control for high speed and precision","sourcePdf":"00817697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036134S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"85","articleId":"817697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":817699,"authors":[{"name":"Jiann-Shiou Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Duluth, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jiann-Shiou Yang","id":"37336551000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"817699","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Constraint optimization","Robust control","Control systems","MIMO","Image restoration","Open loop systems","Noise robustness","Feedback","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable control systems","MIMO systems","discrete time systems","control system synthesis","H/sup /spl infin control","discrete Fourier transforms","sensitivity","robust control","minimisation","image restoration","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transform approach","constrained mixed H/sup 2/ sensitivity optimization","robust controller design","MIMO discrete-time systems","constrained mixed H/sup 2/ sensitivity minimization problem","digital image restoration techniques","DFT","H/sup 2/ control problem","constrained vector minimization problem","l/sup 2/-space","two-stage solution approach","robust controller","multichannel algorithms","partially block circular structure"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses a robust controller design for multiinput-multioutput (MIMO) discrete-time systems by approximately solving a constrained mixed H/sup 2/ sensitivity minimization problem. Using some of the digital image restoration techniques and by working in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain, we convert the H/sup 2/ control problem into a constrained vector minimization problem in the l/sup 2/-space. A two-stage solution approach is detailed and the robust controller is constructed. The advantage of using the proposed method is that the l/sup 2/-space solution can be analytically expressed and efficiently calculated via existing multichannel algorithms due to the partially block circular structure of the matrices involved in the DFT domain. The approximation can be made arbitrarily close to the original H/sup 2/ control problem if the number of the DFT points is large. Several examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/87.817699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/17719/00817699.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.817699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17719","startPage":"138","endPage":"150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrete Fourier transform approach to a constrained mixed H/sup 2/ sensitivity optimization with applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=817699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A discrete Fourier transform approach to a constrained mixed H/sup 2/ sensitivity optimization with applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6474601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrete Fourier transform approach to a constrained mixed H/sup 2/ sensitivity optimization with applications","sourcePdf":"00817699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044642S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","articleId":"817699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":817703,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We have recently developed a duplex waveguide-fiber connector called the planar lightwave circuit (PLC) connector which utilizes a physical contact (PC) connection between optical waveguides and bare fibers. We report our development of a multi-fiber PLC connector for optical modules with several tens of channels at its interface.

Recent reports showed that ultra-wide bandwidths, wider than 80nm were possible by using both the C-band (1550nm band) and L-band (1580nm band). System experiments showed the possibility of their application to real systems. In spite of the large bandwidth of the single ultra-wideband EDFA, bandwidth-distance products on the demonstrations limited to less than 24K nm-km (55.6nm/spl times/400km, 40nm/spl times/600km). The key issues are how to maintain the flat gain with transmission distance increase and how to achieve low noise figure for L-band EDFAs. In the work, we demonstrate a 124K nm-km (52nm/spl times/ 2400nm) transmission of 51 channels at 17dB of the optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR), by employing a low-noise wideband amplifier in conjunction with an all-fiber acousto-optic tunable filter. We have employed a re-circulating EDFA loop which consists of acousto-optic modulators, a single mode fiber, an attenuator, an isolator, a polarization scrambler, and an wideband EDFA (WEDFA).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/817761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 1999-Sept. 3 1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6537200","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of 540-dB loss compensation over 52 nm gain bandwidth with wideband erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of 540-dB loss compensation over 52 nm gain bandwidth with wideband erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"00817761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051214S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 1999-Sept. 3 1999","isNumber":"17626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6572","articleId":"817761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":817774,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The quartz substrate has low attenuation and relatively uniform dielectric constant versus frequency in GHz range. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system, the dielectric constant and absorption coefficient of pure water was measured at the frequency range from 10 GHz to 100 GHz. The pulse beam is not only a nondestructive but also a noncontact method. Also, as the beam is normally incident to the surface, any semiconductors and metals can be easily tested as far as the materials are placed on the bottom of the system.

In recent years it has been studied extensively and a rapid progress has been achieved. In the material aspect, new organic and inorganic holographic recording media have been discovered. In the system aspect, different schemes for multiplexing thousands of high quality holograms in a single material volume have been proposed and demonstrated. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new applications of holographic memories for using the advantages of high data density and high speed data rate. In this paper we present our research on image recognition by using volume holographic data storage of binary phase images. First, we describe the technique of operating liquid crystal televisions (LCTV) as a binary phase spatial light modulator. Then, we address the benefit of using phase images for correlation. Finally, we present a finger print recognition system for associative memory. Experimental results will be presented, and the signal to noise ratio and channel capability issues will be addressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest. CLEO/Pacific Rim '99.

Trained DTRNN usually show FSM behaviour for strings up to a certain length, but not beyond; this is usually called instability. Other authors have shown that DTRNN may actually behave as FSM for strings of any length and have devised strategies to construct such DTRNN. In these strategies, m-state deterministic FSM are encoded and the number of state units in the DTRNN is /spl Theta/(m).

It utilizes coherent neural network modules whose behavior (forward processing, learning, self-organization, etc.) is controlled by their carrier-wave frequencies. The behaviors constructs an orthogonal basis-function set in frequency domain. Therefore the network is able to obtain an arbitrary (continuous/discrete) property as a combinatorial profile. Through this mechanism, an intentionality-controlling network self-organizes adaptively into a symbol-, pattern-, or intermediate processing circuit.

Irrelevant or noisy features unnecessarily increase the complexity of the problem and can degrade modelling performance. Here, multiobjective genetic algorithms are proposed as effective means of evolving a diverse population of alternative feature sets with various accuracy/complexity trade-offs. They are shown to be particularly successful in neurofuzzy modelling, in conjunction with a method for performing fast fitness evaluation. The major contributions of the paper are in the use of a specific type of multiobjective genetic algorithm, based on the concept of dominance, for feature selection; and the combination of fast fitness evaluation of neurofuzzy models with a genetic algorithm.

Without resets, the internal state values may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is an adaptive \"forget gate\" that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review an illustrative benchmark problem on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve a continual version of that problem.

Because of the large input set involved in practice, feature extraction is examined to reduce the input features, the techniques considered being stepwise linear regression and a genetic algorithm. The results of these experiments have demonstrated an improvement in classification performance for multilayer perceptrons, Kohonen and probabilistic networks, using both genetic algorithms and stepwise linear regression over other architectures considered in this work. In addition, linear regression also performed better than a genetic algorithm for feature extraction. For classification problems involving a clear two class structure we consider a synthesis of stepwise linear regression with any of the architectures listed above to offer demonstrable improvements in performance for important real world tasks.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19991239","pdfPath":"/iel5/6633/17688/00818064.pdf","startPage":"976","endPage":"981 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Ninth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ICANN 99.

The output observations of the nonlinear channel are regarded as inputs of the RBF neural filter. The weights of the neural network are updated by the LA algorithm that is based on Lyapunov stability theory so that the error between the reference signal and output of the RBF neural filter can converge to zero asymptotically. The stochastic properties of the signals are not required and the stability is guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability theory. The design of the LA algorithm is extremely simplified compared with existing LMS and RLS algorithms.

The shear operation on the lattice is associated with an operation on the synthesis and the analysis window, consisting of a multiplication by a quadratic-phase function. Following this procedure, the well-known biorthogonality condition for the window functions in the rectangular sampling geometry can be directly translated to the quincunx case.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Geometry","Lattices","Fourier transforms","Signal synthesis","Signal analysis","Chirp modulation","Biomedical signal processing","Australia","Frequency synthesizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified Zak transform","quincunx-type sampling geometry","Gabor signal expansion","Gabor transform","quincunx lattice representation","rectangular lattice","shear operation","rotation operation","product forms","rectangular sampling geometry","synthesis window","analysis window","multiplication","quadratic-phase function","biorthogonality condition","window functions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.818162","publicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

Then the most similar block will be found by searching the remaining candidate blocks. The complexity of reducing the search space is very small, but it can remove candidate blocks from the search window efficiently and effectively.

We present a digital synchronization technique that provides accurate timing and frequency tracking estimates for severely degraded and noisy channel environments. In addition, the synchronization technique can correct large timing misalignment of the received OFDM symbols, and provides acquisition of frequency offsets on the order of multiple sub-channel spacings. Algorithm complexity is minimized by deriving timing and frequency error estimates from the same basic algorithm, making it suitable to handheld radios. The estimation accuracy is excellent, even for very low signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithmic converges within one baud interval, and thus provides a good solution for systems requiring rapid acquisition and symbol timing alignment at system startup.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.818202","publicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

This paper proposes the recognition of car license plate which is accurate and robust to environmental variation by using the car's license plate patterns according to motor vehicle regulation and a 4-layer BP neural network with supervised learning. In this method, the candidates regions of the car license plate are determined approximately according to the car license plate regulation such as color, the ratio and shape of the car license plate, the pattern of characters and numbers etc. For the results of recognition by neural networks, the candidate that has characters and numbers according to motor vehicle regulation is certified as license-plate region. Since the results of characters-pattern recognition are used to certify the license plate, the ability of license plate extraction is more accurate and the car can be identified simultaneously. The experimental results of seventy car images with the prototype of the automatic parking system show the performance of car license plate extraction rate of 96%, and the recognition rate is 92%.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPA.1999.818210","publicationTitle":"ISSPA '99.

Since the RTD between mobile terminals (MT) and earth station (ES) via satellite in LEO is on the order of 10-20 ns and fading is more severe, a conventional closed-loop power control with fixed step size is much less effective than it is on a terrestrial channel. In order to cope with this performance degradation, we propose a closed-loop power control scheme by adaptive fuzzy rule-based step size decision method which is based on fuzzy logic control (FLC). So, in this paper, we compare the performance of the adaptive fuzzy closed-loop power control with that of the conventional fixed step closed-loop power control, we show that the proposed method makes better performance.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1999.818340","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

When the traffic load is high in a DS-CDMA system, allowing a local user to occupy resources sometimes blocks several call requests in the neighboring cells. In this paper, flexible CAC schemes are proposed as a solution to the above problem and compared with conventional CAC scheme under uniform and non-uniform traffic distributions. Flexible CAC schemes reserve small part of resources for call requests in other cells instead of accepting a call request in its own cell. Reserving small part reduces the overall average blocking rate when the traffic load is high. Especially when the traffics are non-uniform.

These block matching algorithms find motion vectors simply from the center of the search window. But the motion vector of the current block is highly related to those of its neighboring blocks. In this paper we propose an efficient hybrid search algorithm (HBS) that exploits the motion vectors of the neighboring blocks to predict the initial search point. HBS searches for a motion vector from the initial search point using the diamond search algorithm(DS). DS is chosen because it is one of the fastest motion vector search algorithms. Experimental results show that HBS is a faster and more accurate motion vector search method than other suboptimal methods for most test sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient hybrid search algorithm for fast block matching in video coding","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

We partitioned the datapath of the Viterbi decoder into largely 3 pipeline stages and to reduce the operation overhead of the add-compare-select unit (ACSU), removed the minimum metric selection logic and exploited the constant subtraction scheme for the metric rescaling. This can be done by using unsigned arithmetic and the overflow detection unit. We also discussed the uselessness of the minimum metric selection logic in the analysis of truncation effects. Simulation results demonstrated that if the traceback depth is long enough, the arbitrary state decoding can be used without many disadvantages over the best state decoding. The survival memory unit (SMU) pipelining architecture based on the modified traceback algorithm is also presented. By exploiting the two registers and multiplexers, we made a one-stage pipeline cell and by cascading them, a traceback operation without LIFO or a complex memory controller can be achieved with a latency of only 2T.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1999.818399","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

Major hurdle in putting this technology for commercial applications has been prohibitive cost of equipment. In this paper we present a methodology for designing and implementing the controller for a thermal imaging system from the hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog and VHDL. We have designed and implemented the digital timing and control signal generation module of thermal imaging system in Xilinx FPGA.

This paper proposes a method of signal enhancement which has an iterative process based on the DSA (delay and sum array) method for estimation of DOA (direction of arrival) and AMUSE (algorithm for multiple unknown signals extraction) for blind deconvolution using a new cost-function. The blind deconvolution extracts the information of the target signal and estimates a coherent signal by a deconvolution of the impulse responses defined as delay factors between sensors. The proposed method can obtain the sharp directivity pattern that the half-bandwidth is narrower than 2/spl deg/ for a frequency range from 100 Hz to 3 kHz when the SNR is varied from -10 dB to +10 dB.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1999.818470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17685","startPage":"538","endPage":"541 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

Also, the proposed camera calibration has advantage that resolves the ill-conditioned calibration in which the object plane is nearly parallel to the image plane. For a little more accurate calibration, the acquired image is divided into two regions according to radial distortion of lens and the neural network is applied to each region. Experimental results and comparison with Tsai's (1987) algorithm prove the validity of the proposed camera calibration.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1999.818509","pdfPath":"/iel5/6630/17685/00818509.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"697 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

In a conventional physical examination radiologists check the chest image projected on a viewing box by a magnifying glass and determine what the disease is. The detection of disease on X-ray fluoroscopy images is tedious and time-consuming for humans. This lowers the efficiency for chest diagnosis as many mistakes by the radiologist are caused because of the need to detect micropathology from a film of small size. So, the authors propose a method to quickly find out what the object on a chest radiograph is. This method comprises the functions of image sampling, median filter, neural network image equalizer and neural network pattern recognition. The authors confirm that this method has improved the problems of conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1999.818629","pdfPath":"/iel5/6630/17736/00818629.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1153 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

Direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS/CDMA) techniques have attracted much attention for use in such systems. In this paper three multi-rate transmission schemes in a WCDMA system are compared. Both AWGN and multipath Rayleigh fading channels are considered. It is shown that for high data rates the spreading factor in the variable spreading factor scheme will be very small and thus the performance will be significantly degraded due to intersymbol interference. Thus variable spreading factors are used for the low and medium high data rates, and combined with multicode transmission for the highest data rates.

An adaptive antenna array can cancel out an undesired signal using beamforming. However, if there interfering signals from undesired users with the same arrival angle as that of a desired user, an adaptive antenna array cannot suppress it. This paper proposes an adaptive antenna array including a multiuser detection unit to cancel out remaining interference at the same beamforming region (arrival angle). The performance analysis of the proposed system is developed for frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation results show that the proposed system provides a significantly enhanced performance.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1999.818650","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE. IEEE Region 10 Conference.

Since the JBIG algorithm has a complicated procedure, it is hard to exploit pipeline and parallel facilities. This paper settles the issue arising in a pipelined architecture by employing a modified probability estimation table (MPET) and realizes a high speed architecture. In addition, the division of critical computations into two stages also contributes to achieving high speed coding. The proposed architecture of the JBIG arithmetic coder and decoder is synthesized from a Verilog description by using a 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS library, and is compared with the conventional architecture.

Heart sound is a highly nonstationary signal. So in the analysis of heart sound it is important to study the frequency and time information. To investigate the exact features of heart sound we adopt Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT) as a time-frequency representation. As a result, it is found that the first sound in the PCG signal and the two components of the second sound are inaccurately detected. On the other hand, it is found that the wavelet transform is capable of detecting the two components, the aortic valve component A2 and pulmonary valve component P2, of the second sound S2 in a normal PCG signal. Furthermore, the wavelet transform provides more features and characteristics of the PCG signals that will help the physician to obtain qualitative and quantitative measurements of the heart sound.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1999.818731","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE.

All arrays consisted of 128/spl times/128=16384 elements with /spl lambda/ spacing operating at 5 MHz. Because of system limitations, not all of the elements could be used. From each array, 256 elements were used as transmitters, and 256 elements were used as receivers. These arrays were compared by computer simulation using Field II. For each array, beamplots for the on-axis case and an illustrative off-axis case were obtained. For the off-axis case, the effects of receive mode dynamic focusing were studied to maintain the beam perpendicular to the transducer face. Main lobe widths, side lobe heights, clutter floor levels, and pulse-echo sensitivities were quantified for each array. The sparse arrays, including a vernier periodic array, a random array, and a Mills cross array, were compared with a fully sampled array that served as the \"gold standard\". The Mills cross design showed the best overall performance under the current system constraints.","doi":"10.1109/58.818752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/17737/00818752.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.818752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse 2-D array design for real time rectilinear volumetric imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818752/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse 2-D array design for real time rectilinear volumetric imaging","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6502033","pubMedId":"18238521","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse 2-D array design for real time rectilinear volumetric imaging","sourcePdf":"00818752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028555S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"84","articleId":"818752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818754,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

For example, a 50 MHz linear phased array requires a center-to-center spacing of only 15 /spl mu/m (one-half wavelength in water) to avoid the formation of grating lobes in the radiation pattern of the array. Fabricating an array with these dimensions is difficult using conventional technology. A split aperture design that permits much larger element spacing (3 to 4 times) while avoiding the formation of grating lobes is described. The 3-D radiation pattern of a 1.9/spl times/1.4 mm, 50-MHz split aperture linear phased array with 33 transmit elements and 33 receive elements has been evaluated theoretically. The azimuthal beam width is 90 /spl mu/m at a distance of 4.0 mm. Grating lobes are suppressed by at least 60 dB at distances >4.0 mm (/spl sim/f/2). The elevation beam width is 220 /spl mu/m at 4.0 mm, and a useful depth of field over the axial range from 4 to 10 mm is obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6502035","pubMedId":"18238523","volume":"47","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the radiation pattern of a split aperture linear phased array for high frequency imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the radiation pattern of a split aperture linear phased array for high frequency imaging","sourcePdf":"00818754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041667S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"5","articleId":"818754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":818766,"authors":[{"name":"M.

If the speed of sound in water and the thickness of the sample are known, the speed of sound in the object may be computed. To measure the transit time differential, a marker such as a zero-crossing, may be used. A sound speed difference between the object and water shifts all markers backward or forward. Frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion may alter the spectral characteristics of the waveform, thereby distorting the locations of markers and introducing variations in sound-speed estimates. Theory is derived to correct for this distortion for Gaussian pulses propagating through linearly attenuating, weakly dispersive media. The theory is validated using numerical analysis, measurements on a tissue mimicking phantom, and on 24 human calcaneus samples in vitro. Variations in soft tissue-like media are generally not exceptionally large for most applications but can be substantial, particularly for high bandwidth pulses propagating through media with high attenuation coefficients. At 500 kHz, variations in velocity estimates in bone can be very substantial, on the order of 40 to 50 m/s because of the high attenuation coefficient of bone. In trabecular bone, the effects of frequency-dependent attenuation are considerable, and the effects of dispersion are negligible.","doi":"10.1109/58.818770","startPage":"265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/17737/00818770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.818770","endPage":"273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion on sound speed measurements: applications in human trabecular bone","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"The effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion on sound speed measurements: applications in human trabecular bone","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6502051","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","pubMedId":"18238539","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion on sound speed measurements: applications in human trabecular bone","sourcePdf":"00818770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087091S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"92","articleId":"818770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818824,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We show that this assumption is wrong in dynamically scheduled processors. A cache miss, for example, can in some cases result in a shorter execution time than a cache hit. Many examples of such timing anomalies are provided. We first provide necessary conditions when timing anomalies can show up and identify what architectural features that may cause such anomalies. We also show that analyzing the effect of these anomalies with known techniques results in prohibitive computational complexities. Instead, we propose some simple code modification techniques to make it impossible for any anomalies to occur. These modifications make it possible to estimate WCET by known techniques. Our evaluation shows that the pessimism imposed by these techniques is fairly limited; it is less than 27% for the programs in our benchmark suite.","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1999.818824","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 20th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (Cat.

Re-designing server code to support QoS provisioning, on the other hand, is costly and time-consuming. To remedy this problem, we propose a new QoS-provisioning approach that does not require modification of server and QoS code. We develop a middleware, called qContracts, that can be transparently interposed between the server process and the operating system to achieve performance differentiation and soft QoS guarantees. The middleware enables reuse of existing legacy software in QoS-sensitive contexts, and off-loads QoS management concerns from future real-time service programmers. As an example, we show how the Apache web server is endowed with QoS support using qContracts on UNIX. Experimental results show the efficacy of the middleware in achieving the contracted QoS, while imposing less than 1% overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6461612","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 1999","displayDocTitle":"QoS provisioning with qContracts in web and multimedia servers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS provisioning with qContracts in web and multimedia servers","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00818827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04083S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6621","citationCount":"21","articleId":"818827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":818828,"authors":[{"name":"C.

While algorithms such as Earliest Deadline First, Rate Monotonic, and the Spring scheduling algorithm can support sophisticated task set characteristics (such as deadlines, precedence constraints, shared resources, jitter etc.), they are all \"open loop\" scheduling algorithms. Open loop refers to the fact that once schedules are created they are not \"adjusted\" based on continuous feedback. While open-loop scheduling algorithms can perform well in static or dynamic systems in which the workloads can be accurately modeled, they can perform poorly in unpredictable dynamic systems. In this paper, we present a feedback control real-time scheduling algorithm and its evaluation. Performance results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm when execution times vary from the worst case and when there are major shifts of total load in the system. A key part of this feedback solution is its explicit use of deadline based metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6461613","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of a feedback control EDF scheduling algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of a feedback control EDF scheduling algorithm","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00818828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072609S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6621","citationCount":"110","articleId":"818828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818836,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

Liu, et al. (1997) in scheduling real-time applications and non-real-time applications, where the schedulability of each real-time application can be validated independently of other applications in the system. We replace the underlying earliest-deadline-first OS scheduler of the open system architecture by W.S. Liu, et al. (1997) with a rate-monotonic OS scheduler. The motivation behind this work is that many existing operating systems may not support the earliest deadline first scheduling very well. We propose to use the idea of sporadic servers to preserve CPU cycles for applications. We also develop schedulability tests for real-time applications which adopt the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm, the earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm, the priority ceiling protocol, and the stack resource policy. We allow tasks in each application to share local and global non-preemptable resources. A global resource synchronization mechanism is proposed. This paper provides a fixed-priority-based alternative for the important open system architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818851/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6461636","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 1999","displayDocTitle":"A fixed-priority-driven open environment for real-time applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fixed-priority-driven open environment for real-time applications","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00818851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051865S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6621","citationCount":"29","articleId":"818851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818859,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In other words, each application, such as video-conferencing, needs multiple resources to satisfy its QoS requirements. We evaluate and compare three strategies to solve this provably NP-hard problem. We show that dynamic programming and mixed integer programming compute optimal solutions to this problem but exhibit very long running times. We then adapt the mixed integer programming problem to yield near-optimal results with smaller running times. Finally, we present an approximation algorithm based on a local search technique that is less than 5% away from the optimal solution but which is more than two orders of magnitude faster. Perhaps more significantly, the local search technique turns out to be very scalable and robust as the number of resources required by each application increases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17672","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 20th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (Cat.

It is found that the worst case effect of channel mismatch on the performance may be modeled as equivalent losses in signal-to-noise ratio.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818868.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","doi":"10.1109/26.818868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-forcing equalizability of FIR and IIR multichannel systems with and without perfect measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Zero-forcing equalizability of FIR and IIR multichannel systems with and without perfect measurements","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6492726","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-forcing equalizability of FIR and IIR multichannel systems with and without perfect measurements","sourcePdf":"00818868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036645S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","articleId":"818868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":818869,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

Subsequently, a method is proposed for computing the PAPR by minimum-distance decoding of C at many points of time. Moreover an upper bound on the error between this computed value and the true one is derived. Analogous results are established for codes defined over arbitrary signal constellations. As an application of this computational method, an approach for reducing the PAPR of C proposed by Jones and Wilkinson (1996) is revisited. This approach is based on introducing a specific phase shift to each coordinate of all the codewords where phase shifts are independent of the codewords and known both to the transmitter and the receiver. We optimize the phase shifts offline by applying our method for computing the PAPR for the coding scenario proposed by the ETSI BRAN Standardization Committee. Reductions of order 4.5 dB can be freely obtained using the computed phase shifts. Examples are provided showing that most of the gain is preserved when the computed optimal phase shifts are rounded to quantenary phase-shift keying (PSK), 8-PSK, and 16-PSK type phase shifts.","doi":"10.1109/26.818871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818871.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the computation and reduction of the peak-to-average power ratio in multicarrier communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"On the computation and reduction of the peak-to-average power ratio in multicarrier communications","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6492729","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the computation and reduction of the peak-to-average power ratio in multicarrier communications","sourcePdf":"00818871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033229S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"189","articleId":"818871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818873,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Ming Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shu-Ming Tseng","id":"37274960000"},{"name":"M.R.

Each user is assumed to have a distinct set of spreading sequences, with a different spreading sequence for each carrier in each user's set. We show that when these sets of sequences are chosen to be the mutually orthogonal (MO) complementary sets of sequences, multiple-access interference is minimal on a nonfading channel. As a result of the autocorrelation sidelobe cancellation properties of the MO complementary sequences, it is possible to pack symbols more closely together on the nonfading channel, resulting in a higher data rate than in multicarrier CDMA using the same spreading sequence for each carrier. The resulting communication system scheme results in an easily parallelized receiver architecture that may be useful in nonfading coherent channels, such as the optical fiber channel or the Rician channel with a strong line-of-sight component. On the Rayleigh fading channel, the performance of the system is identical to that of multicarrier CDMA employing a single spreading sequence per user, with only a minimal increase in receiver complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multiple access interference","Bandwidth","Autocorrelation","Optical receivers","Fading","Frequency","Optical fibers","Rician channels","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","multiuser channels","sequences","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","correlation methods","radio receivers","Rician channels","Rayleigh channels","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous multicarrier DS-CDMA","mutually orthogonal complementary sequences","multiple spreading sequences","code-division multiple-access","multiple-access interference","nonfading channel","autocorrelation sidelobe cancellation","data rate","communication system","parallelized receiver architecture","nonfading coherent channels","optical fiber channel","Rician channel","line-of-sight component","Rayleigh fading channel","system performance","multicarrier CDMA","receiver complexity","single spreading sequence per user","multicarrier modulation","AWGN channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818873","doi":"10.1109/26.818873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818873","startPage":"53","endPage":"59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous multicarrier DS-CDMA using mutually orthogonal complementary sets of sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous multicarrier DS-CDMA using mutually orthogonal complementary sets of sequences","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6492731","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous multicarrier DS-CDMA using mutually orthogonal complementary sets of sequences","sourcePdf":"00818873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078804S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"92","articleId":"818873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818876,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Existing code-division multiple-access systems, by virtue of spread-spectrum signaling and RAKE reception, exploit only part of the channel diversity via multipath combination. Moreover, their performance degrades under fast fading commonly encountered in mobile scenarios. In this paper, we develop new signaling and reception techniques that maximally exploit channel diversity via joint multipath-Doppler processing. Our approach is based on a canonical representation of the wireless channel, which leads to a time-frequency generalization of the RAKE receiver for diversity processing. Our signaling scheme facilitates joint multipath-Doppler diversity by spreading the symbol waveform beyond the intersymbol duration to make the channel time-selective. A variety of detection schemes are developed to account for the intersymbol interference (ISI) due to overlapping symbols. However, our results indicate that the effects of ISI are virtually negligible due to the excellent correlation properties of the pseudorandom codes. Performance analysis also shows that relatively small Doppler spreads can yield significant diversity gains. The inherently higher level of diversity achieved by time-selective signaling brings the fading channel closer to an additive white Gaussian noise channel, thereby facilitating the use of powerful existing coding techniques for Gaussian channels.","doi":"10.1109/26.818876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818876.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-selective signaling and reception for communication over multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818876/","displayDocTitle":"Time-selective signaling and reception for communication over multipath fading channels","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6492734","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-selective signaling and reception for communication over multipath fading channels","sourcePdf":"00818876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112924S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","articleId":"818876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":818880,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Convergence issues are discussed, and the concept of /spl epsiv/-convergence is introduced to determine the number of stages required for practical convergence for both short and long codes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Silicon carbide","Detectors","Nonlinear filters","Convergence","Multiple access interference","Bit error rate","Filtering","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","matrix algebra","code division multiple access","error statistics","digital filters","land mobile radio","convergence of numerical methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix-algebraic approach","successive interference cancellation","CDMA","linear SIC schemes","single stage","multistage","linear matrix filtering","received chip-matched filtered signal vector","bit-error rate","short code systems","/spl epsiv/-convergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818882","doi":"10.1109/26.818882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818882","startPage":"145","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A matrix-algebraic approach to successive interference cancellation in CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A matrix-algebraic approach to successive interference cancellation in CDMA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6492740","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A matrix-algebraic approach to successive interference cancellation in CDMA","sourcePdf":"00818882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047226S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"103","articleId":"818882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":818883,"authors":[{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Centre for Wireless Communications, Singapore"],"lastName":"Dongning Guo","id":"37272631900"},{"name":"L.K.

It is shown that the linear PIC, whether conventional or weighted, can be seen as a linear matrix filter applied directly to the chip-matched filtered received signal vector. An expression for the exact bit-error rate (BER) is obtained, and conditions on the eigenvalues of the code correlation matrix and the weighting factors to ensure convergence are derived. The close relationship between the linear multistage PIC and the steepest descent method (SDM) for minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) is demonstrated. A modified weighted PIC structure that resembles the SDM is suggested which approaches the minimum MSE (MMSE) detector rather than the decorrelator. It is shown that for a K-user system, only K PIC stages are required for the equivalent matrix filter to be identical to the the MMSE filter. For fewer stages, techniques are devised for optimizing the choice of weights with respect to the MSE. One unique optimal choice of weights is found, which will lead to the minimum achievable MSE at the final stage. Simulation results show that a few stages are sufficient for near-MMSE performance.","doi":"10.1109/26.818883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818883.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A matrix-algebraic approach to linear parallel interference cancellation in CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"A matrix-algebraic approach to linear parallel interference cancellation in CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6492741","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A matrix-algebraic approach to linear parallel interference cancellation in CDMA","sourcePdf":"00818883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.78518S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"96","articleId":"818883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818884,"authors":[{"name":"Sang Wu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Wu Kim","id":"37085287700"},{"name":"Ye Hoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ye Hoon Lee","id":"37280117800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"818884","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":139},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We consider combined rate and power adaptations in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access communications, where the transmission power and the data rate are adapted relative to channel variations.

Previously, a new blind adaptive receiver was proposed based on an anchored least mean-squared (LMS) algorithm that requires only the spreading code and symbol timing of the desired user but obviates the need for a training sequence. In this work, it is analytically demonstrated that the blind LMS algorithm always provides (nominally) faster convergence than the training driven LMS-MMSE receiver of but at the cost of increased tap-weight fluctuations or misadjustment. Second, the property that the optimal MMSE or minimum-output energy filter coefficients lies in the signal subspace is exploited to propose a new efficient blind adaptive receiver requiring fewer adaptive coefficients. Improved detector characteristics (superior convergence rates and steady-state signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios) is indicated by analysis and supported by simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17738/00818885.pdf","startPage":"169","endPage":"175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.818885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.818885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace blind adaptive detection for multiuser CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Timing","Least squares approximation","Convergence","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Interference","Algorithm design and analysis","Costs","Fluctuations","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","multiuser channels","radio receivers","least mean squares methods","code division multiple access","adaptive signal detection","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","adaptive filters","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace blind adaptive detection","multiuser CDMA","linear minimum mean-square error receiver","MMSE receiver","direct-sequence code-division multiple access","training sequence","blind adaptive receiver","least mean-squared algorithm","DS-CDMA","spreading code","symbol timing","blind LMS algorithm","LMS-MMSE receiver","tap-weight fluctuations","optimal MMSE","minimum-output energy filter coefficients","signal subspace","adaptive coefficients","convergence rates","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios","simulation","interference suppression","blind adaptive filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","displayDocTitle":"Subspace blind adaptive detection for multiuser CDMA","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6492743","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace blind adaptive detection for multiuser CDMA","sourcePdf":"00818885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096889S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"47","articleId":"818885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818887,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The designed CORDIC-based QAM modulator has about the same logic complexity as the two multipliers and the adder with the same word sizes.

In this approach, the overall filter consists of a periodic model filter, its power-complementary periodic filter, and two masking filters. The model filters are composed of two all-pass filters in parallel, whereas the masking filters are linear-phase finite-impulse response (FIR) filters. The transfer functions of the all-pass filters are functions of z/sup M/, which implies that the maximal sample frequency for the overall filter is M times that of the corresponding conventional IIR filter. The maximal sample frequency can be increased to an arbitrary level for arbitrary bandwidths. The overall filter can be designed by separately optimizing the model and masking filters with the aid of conventional approximation techniques. The obtained overall filter also serves as a good initial filter for further optimization. Both nonlinear-phase and approximately linear-phase filters are considered. By using the new approach, the potential problems of pole-zero cancellations, which are inherent in algorithm transformation techniques, are avoided. Further, robust filters under finite-arithmetic conditions can always be obtained by using wave-digital all-pass filters and nonrecursive FIR filters. Several design examples are included illustrating the properties of the new filters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.818894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17740","startPage":"48","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17740/00818894.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed recursive digital filters based on the frequency-response masking approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 2000","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-speed recursive digital filters based on the frequency-response masking approach","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6502718","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed recursive digital filters based on the frequency-response masking approach","sourcePdf":"00818894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057545S","chronDate":"Jan 2000","isNumber":"17740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"35","articleId":"818894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":818896,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The objective is to assign calls to wavelengths in a way that minimizes the total cost of electronic equipment [e.g., the number of SONET add/drop multiplexers (ADM's)]. We show that the general traffic grooming problem is NP-complete. However, for some special cases we obtain algorithms that result in a significant reduction in the number of ADM's. When the traffic from all nodes is destined to a single node, and all traffic rates are the same, we obtain a solution that minimizes the number of ADM's. In the more general case of all-to-all uniform frame we obtain a lower bound on the number of ADM's required, and provide a heuristic algorithm that performs closely to that bound. To account for more realistic traffic scenarios, we also consider distance dependent traffic, where the traffic load between two nodes is inversely proportional to the distance between them, and again provide a nearly optimal heuristic algorithm that results in substantial ADM savings. Finally, we consider the use of a hub node, where traffic can be switched between different wavelength, and obtain an optimal algorithm which minimizes the number of ADM's by efficiently multiplexing and switching the traffic at the hub. Moreover, we show that any solution not using a hub can be transformed into a solution with a hub using fewer or the same number of ADM's.","doi":"10.1109/50.818901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.818901","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17739/00818901.pdf","startPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic grooming algorithms for reducing electronic multiplexing costs in WDM ring networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818901/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic grooming algorithms for reducing electronic multiplexing costs in WDM ring networks","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6500314","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic grooming algorithms for reducing electronic multiplexing costs in WDM ring networks","sourcePdf":"00818901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02575S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"214","articleId":"818901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818902,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

In this paper the performance of direct detection p-i-n diode intensity modulated SS systems is analyzed using the saddlepoint approximation. Using this approach, based on moment generating functions, the effects of pulse distortion, intersymbol interference (ISI) and nonideal modulator extinction ratios have been included in the analysis of SS systems for the first time. The presence of ISI error floors as the product of optical bandwidth and bit time decreases is demonstrated using a model that agrees with previous work in the case of low bit rate, widely spaced channels. In addition, comparisons with recent experimental results from the literature are made with good agreement. Subsequently, the use of an integrate and dump filter where the integration time starts after the beginning of a bit is investigated and shown to produce significant enhancements to bit-error rate performance. Furthermore, it is shown that a modulator extinction ratio of 20 dB will suffice for 10/sup -9/ bit-error rate (BER) in most cases, with 30 dB offering a performance close to that possible with an ideal modulator. Finally, the likely system power for an SS system is presented.","doi":"10.1109/50.818902","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"13","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17739/00818902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.818902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of direct detection spectrally sliced receivers using Fabry-Perot filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical pulse generation","Pulse modulation","Optical distortion","Extinction ratio","Optical filters","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["p-i-n photodiodes","wavelength division multiplexing","intersymbol interference","approximation theory","optical filters","optical communication equipment","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","direct detection spectrally sliced receivers","Fabry-Perot filters","spectrally sliced broad-band source","laser diode sources","wavelength-division multiplexing","WDM","direct detection p-i-n diode intensity modulated SS systems","saddlepoint approximation","moment generating functions","pulse distortion","intersymbol interference","nonideal modulator extinction ratios","ISI error floors","optical bandwidth","bit time decrease","integrate and dump filter","integration time","bit-error rate performance","modulator extinction ratio","bit-error rate","ideal modulator","system power","SS system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of direct detection spectrally sliced receivers using Fabry-Perot filters","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6500315","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818902/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of direct detection spectrally sliced receivers using Fabry-Perot filters","sourcePdf":"00818902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053881S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","articleId":"818902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":818903,"authors":[{"name":"Che-Li Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Che-Li Lin","id":"37366148100"},{"name":"Jingshown Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jingshown Wu","id":"37279168200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"818903","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We propose the random Manchester codes (RMC) to improve the bit error probability (BEP) performance in both synchronous and asynchronous fiber-optic code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems.

The input and output interface of the prototype are four-channel 10-Gb/s signals. The prototype can be mounted on a 300-mm-height rack and offers stable 40-Gb/s operation with a single power supply voltage. InP high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) digital IC's perform 40-Gb/s multiplexing/demultiplexing and regeneration. In the receiver prototype, unitraveling-carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) generates 1 V/sub pp/ output and directly drives the InP HEMT decision circuit (DEC) without any need for an electronic amplifier. A clock recovery circuit recovers a 40-GHz clock with jitter of 220 fs/sub pp/ from a 40-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) optical input. The tolerable dispersion range of the prototype within a 1-dB penalty from the receiver sensitivity at zero-dispersion is as wide as 95 ps/nm, and the clock phase margin is wider than 70/spl deg/ over almost all the tolerable dispersion range. A 100-km-long transmission experiment was performed using the prototype. A high receiver sensitivity [-25.1 dBm for NRZ (2/sup 7/-1) pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS)] was obtained after the transmission. The 40-Gb/s regeneration of the InP DEC suppressed the deviation in sensitivity among output channels to only 0.3 dB. In addition, four-channel 40-Gb/s wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) transmission was successfully performed.","doi":"10.1109/50.818904","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17739/00818904.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.818904","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"34","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully electrical 40-Gb/s TDM system prototype based on InP HEMT digital IC technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Fully electrical 40-Gb/s TDM system prototype based on InP HEMT digital IC technologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818904/","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6500317","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully electrical 40-Gb/s TDM system prototype based on InP HEMT digital IC technologies","sourcePdf":"00818904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107695S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","articleId":"818904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":818908,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Optical ring-resonator gyros suffer mainly from polarization fluctuation induced noise and backscattering induced noise. We discuss eigenstate of polarization in the waveguide to clarify behavior of the former and propose a countermeasure with control of the waveguide birefringence. As for the latter, binary phase shift keying (B-PSK) with a special signal processing is proposed. Thermooptic (TO) phase modulation is the only one scheme to apply B-PSK in the silica waveguide, whose bandwidth is limited to /spl sim/1 KHz. To utilize the narrow bandwidth of the TO modulator effectively, we propose an electrical signal processing scheme and a modulation waveform to compensate the frequency response. By constructing an experimental setup, suppression of the backscattering induced noise is demonstrated, and the gyro output is observed with applying an equivalent rotation.","doi":"10.1109/50.818908","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"66","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17739/00818908.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.818908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithically integrated resonator microoptic gyro on silica planar lightwave circuit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microoptics","Silicon compounds","Optical waveguides","Optical noise","Optical resonators","Optical signal processing","Optical polarization","Backscatter","Bandwidth","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon compounds","integrated optoelectronics","gyroscopes","backscatter","light scattering","phase shift keying","micro-optics","optical noise","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","thermo-optical effects","optical planar waveguides","birefringence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monolithically integrated resonator microoptic gyro","silica planar lightwave circuit","monolithically integrated","noise factors","optical ring-resonator gyros","polarization fluctuation induced noise","backscattering induced noise","eigenstate","waveguide","waveguide birefringence control","electrical signal processing scheme","modulation waveform","frequency response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Monolithically integrated resonator microoptic gyro on silica planar lightwave circuit","volume":"18","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6500321","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818908/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithically integrated resonator microoptic gyro on silica planar lightwave circuit","sourcePdf":"00818908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037415S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"105","articleId":"818908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":818911,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Increasing the capacitance with a current-mode multiplier allows the circuit to occupy less silicon area and to more effectively drive capacitive loads. Reducing physical area requirements while producing the same or perhaps better performance is especially useful in complex systems where most, if not all, functions are integrated onto a single integrated circuit. Die area in such systems is a luxury. The increasing demand for mobile battery-operated devices is a driving force toward higher integration. The enhanced Miller-compensation technique developed in this paper helps enable higher integration while being readily applicable to any process technology, be it CMOS, bipolar, or BiCMOS. Furthermore, the technique applies, in general, to amplifier circuits in feedback configuration. Experimentally, the integrated linear regulator (fabricated in a 1-/spl mu/m BiCMOS process technology) proved to be stable for a wide variety of loading conditions: load currents of up to 200 mA, equivalent series resistance of up to 3 /spl Omega/, and load capacitors ranging from 1.5 nF to 20 /spl mu/E The total quiescent current flowing through the regulator was less than 30 /spl mu/A during zero load-current conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","volume":"35","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6485973","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Active capacitor multiplier in Miller-compensated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active capacitor multiplier in Miller-compensated circuits","sourcePdf":"00818917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026811S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"176","articleId":"818917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":818918,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The proposed multi-level multiphase charge-recycling method reduces power consumption incurred in driving highly capacitive column lines by storing the charge into the external capacitors and reusing it in the next cycle. With the proposed method, power consumption can be reduced asymptotically to zero with the infinite number of storage capacitors. However it is also shown that total power reduction can be counterbalanced by the power consumption in driving switches used in the recycling process. Analytical equations, simulation results, and measurement results from an experimental chip are shown to validate the proposed method.

The high linearity required by the blocking and intermodulating signals, which are not completely suppressed by the IF filter, has been achieved using 4.7 mA from the 2,5-V power supply.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17741/00818926.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.818926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.818926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=818926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 71-MHz CMOS IF-baseband strip for GSM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strips","GSM","CMOS technology","Demodulation","Baseband","Low pass filters","Gain measurement","Noise measurement","Noise figure","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","intermediate-frequency amplifiers","cellular radio","digital radio","superheterodyne receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS IF-baseband strip IC","superheterodyne GSM receiver","programmable IF amplifier","quadrature demodulator","low-pass filter","channel selection","mobile communication","71 MHz","0.25 micron","89 dB","3.8 dB","4.7 mA","2.5 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/818926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A 71-MHz CMOS IF-baseband strip for GSM","volume":"35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6485982","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 71-MHz CMOS IF-baseband strip for GSM","sourcePdf":"00818926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072311S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"17741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","articleId":"818926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":818927,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Liang Dai","id":"37087260808"},{"name":"R.

Then, the ac power dissipation of bit lines and data lines, which is proportional to the voltage swing, can be significantly saved. A new current-mode 128/spl times/8 SRAM has been designed based on a 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, and the new SRAM consumes only 30% of the power of an SRAM with current-mode read but voltage mode write operations. Besides a test chip for the new SRAM, it has also been embedded in an 8-bit 1.1-controller.

High pin count parts from advanced deep sub-micron technologies were stimulated by combining V/sub cc/ supply pin excitation with dynamic component operation using active vectors at low clock frequency. Weak product that appears extremely robust to an over-damped uni-polar trigger was confirmed to be very susceptible to negative-going, under-damped bi-polar transients. The trigger avoids the risk of MM electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage; but combines elements of voltage over-stress, current injection, and slew rate into one stress application. The low resonant frequency facilitates straightforward integration into very high pin count testers.","doi":"10.1109/EOSESD.1999.819005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EOSESD.1999.819005","startPage":"190","endPage":"202","displayPublicationTitle":"Electrical Overstress/Electrostatic Discharge Symposium Proceedings. 1999 (IEEE Cat.

Numerical applications are performed with two different generations of submicron CMOS technologies, including the determination of the sensitive thicknesses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819093/","volume":"46","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6501142","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Determination of key parameters for SEU occurrence using 3-D full cell SRAM simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of key parameters for SEU occurrence using 3-D full cell SRAM simulations","sourcePdf":"00819093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049598S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"110","articleId":"819093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":819094,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We review several factors and tradeoffs affecting the successful application of COTS parts including (1) hardness assurance and qualification issues; (2) system hardening techniques, and (3) life-cycle costs. The paper also describes several experimental studies that address trends in total-dose, transient, and single-event radiation hardness as COTS technology scales to smaller feature sizes. As an example, the level at which dose-rate upset occurs in Samsung SRAMs increases from 1.4/spl times/10/sup 8/ rad(Si)/s for a 256 K SRAM to 7.7/spl times/10/sup 9/ rad(Si)/s for a 4 M SRAM, indicating unintentional hardening improvements in the design or process of a commercial technology. Additional experiments were performed to quantify variations in radiation hardness for COTS parts. In one study, only small (10-15%) variations were found in the dose-rate upset and latchup thresholds for Samsung 4 M SRAMs from three different date codes. In another study, irradiations of 4 M SRAMs from Samsung, Hitachi, and Toshiba indicate large differences in total-dose radiation hardness.

It is found that indeed the FOM parameter gives, in most cases, a good agreement with the rates found using the full SEU cross section plots of the devices. The agreement is poorer in cases where a high portion of the proton flux comes from low energy protons and for very SEU-hard devices.

The model is based on the solution of the Schrodinger equation for a simplified oxide band structure, where RILC occurs through electron trap-assisted tunneling. The values of the model parameters have been calibrated by comparing the transmission probabilities obtained in this model with those obtained through the WKB method in the actual oxide band structure. No free fitting parameter has been introduced, and all physical constant values have been selected within the values found in literature. Different trap distributions have been considered as candidates, but the comparison between simulated and experimental curves have indicated that a double gaussian distribution in space and in energy grants the best fit of the experimental results for different ionizing particles, oxide fields during irradiation, radiation doses, and oxide thickness. Excellent matching has been found for both positive and negative RILC by using a single trap distribution. The trap density linearly increases with the radiation dose and decreases with the oxide field during irradiation. The trap distribution is spatially symmetrical in the oxide, centered in the middle of the oxide thickness, and is not modified as the cumulative dose increases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819120/","volume":"46","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6501169","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A model of radiation induced leakage current (RILC) in ultra-thin gate oxides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model of radiation induced leakage current (RILC) in ultra-thin gate oxides","sourcePdf":"00819120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049863S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"57","articleId":"819120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":819122,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

To show that values so derived are consistent with previous calculations, we compare alpha particle NIEL for GaAs derived from SRIM with a direct analytical calculation.

After its deployment, the electrical responses of several bipolar transistors and linear circuits have been and continue to be recorded once during every 12-hour orbit. System dosimeters are monitored to establish an average accumulated dose per orbit. With this information, the electrical parameter data are correlated with the dosimetry data to determine the total dose response of each device. This paper updates information on the ELDRS experiment through May 14, 1999. As of this date, the experiment has been in flight for a period of 18 months and has accumulated an approximate dose of 18 krd(Si). For comparison, devices, specifically linear circuits with the same date code, were irradiated using Co-60 sources, herein defined as ground-based tests. The ground-based tests are used to evaluate two hardness assurance tests, a room temperature irradiation at 10 mrd(Si)/s and an elevated temperature irradiation at 100/spl deg/C and 10 rd(Si)/s and to evaluate the ELDRS response. To that end, irradiations were performed at room temperature, approximately 22/spl deg/C, at fixed dose rates of 100, 1, and 0.01 rd(Si)/s and at elevated temperature, approximately 100/spl deg/C, at a fixed dose rate of 10 rd(Si)/s. Currently, irradiations are being performed at room temperature at a fixed dose rate of 0.001 rd(Si)/s. Comparing the ground-based data to the flight data clearly demonstrates that enhanced parametric degradation has occurred in the flight parts. The two hardness assurance screens predicted ELDRS but the design margin for the elevated temperature test may not be adequate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.819128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17748/00819128.pdf","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1615","doi":"10.1109/23.819128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) of linear circuits in a space environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) of linear circuits in a space environment","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6501177","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) of linear circuits in a space environment","sourcePdf":"00819128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078448S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"19","articleId":"819128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":819130,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Comparisons were made with devices irradiated with 300 rad(Si)/s gamma radiation to verify if LDR radiation is a serious radiation hardness assurance (RHA) issue. Almost no LDR degradation was observed in this technology up to 50 krad(Si). The assumption of the presence of two competing mechanisms is justified by experimental results. At low total dose (<20 krad), an anomalous base current decrease was observed which is attributed to self-annealing of deep-level traps to shallower levels. An increase in base current at larger total doses is attributed to radiation induced generation-recombination (G/R) center generation. Experiments on gate-assisted lateral PNP transistors and 2D numerical simulations using MEDICI were used to confirm these assertions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17748/00819130.pdf","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1626","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.819130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.819130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17748","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous dose rate effects in gamma irradiated SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Degradation","USA Councils","Space technology","Electron traps","Bipolar transistors","Microelectronics","Cranes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ge-Si alloys","semiconductor materials","heterojunction bipolar transistors","gamma-ray effects","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dose rate effect","LDR gamma irradiation","SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor","radiation hardness assurance","self-annealing","deep level trap","generation-recombination center","lateral PNP transistor","2D numerical simulation","MEDICI program","base current","50 krad","SiGe"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous dose rate effects in gamma irradiated SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6501179","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous dose rate effects in gamma irradiated SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00819130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064911S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"33","articleId":"819130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":819131,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A new commercial prototype, named the RS family, was used as an example for the investigation. The device is fabricated in a 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. Its architecture is reviewed to provide a better understanding of the impact of single event upset (SEU) on the device during operation. The SEU effect of different memories available on the device is evaluated. Heavy ion test data and SPICE simulations are used integrally to extract the threshold LET (linear energy transfer). Together with the saturation cross-section measurement from the layout, a rate prediction is done on each memory type. The SEU in the configuration SRAM is identified as the dominant failure mode and is discussed in detail. The single event transient error in combinational logic is also investigated and simulated by SPICE. SEU mitigation by hardening the memories and employing EDAC (error detection and correction) at the device level are presented. For the configuration SRAM (CSRAM) cell, the trade-off between resistor dc-coupling and redundancy hardening techniques are investigated with interesting results. Preliminary heavy ion test data show no sign of SEL (single event latch-up). With regard to ionizing radiation effects, the increase in static leakage current (static I/sub CC/) measured indicates a device tolerance of approximately 50 krad(Si).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17748/00819146.pdf","doi":"10.1109/23.819146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.819146","startPage":"1728","endPage":"1735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM based re-programmable FPGA for space applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819146/","displayDocTitle":"SRAM based re-programmable FPGA for space applications","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6501195","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM based re-programmable FPGA for space applications","sourcePdf":"00819146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106554S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"47","articleId":"819146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":819148,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

Charge trapping in the buried oxide can lead to back-channel leakage and makes hardening SOI transistors more challenging than hardening bulk-silicon transistors. Two avenues for hardening the back-channel are 1) to use specially prepared SOI buried oxides that reduce the net amount of trapped positive charge or 2) to design transistors that are less sensitive to the effects of trapped charge in the buried oxide. In this work, we propose a partially-depleted SOI transistor structure for mitigating the effects of trapped charge in the buried oxide on radiation hardness. We call this structure the BUSFET-Body Under Source FET. The BUSFET utilizes a shallow source and a deep drain. As a result, the silicon depletion region at the back channel caused by radiation-induced charge trapping in the buried oxide does not form a conducting path between source and drain. Thus, the BUSFET structure design can significantly reduce radiation-induced back-channel leakage without using specially prepared buried oxides. Total dose hardness is achieved without degrading the intrinsic SEU or dose rate hardness of SOI technology. The effectiveness of the BUSFET structure for reducing total-dose back-channel leakage depends on several variables, including the top silicon film thickness and doping concentration, and the depth of the source.","doi":"10.1109/23.819158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.819158","endPage":"1816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17748/00819158.pdf","startPage":"1809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BUSFET-a radiation-hardened SOI transistor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819158/","displayDocTitle":"BUSFET-a radiation-hardened SOI transistor","volume":"46","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6501207","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BUSFET-a radiation-hardened SOI transistor","sourcePdf":"00819158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037937S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"49","articleId":"819158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":819159,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.

RMTP-II is a reliable multicast protocol, designed to reliably and efficiently send data from a few senders to large groups of simultaneous recipients. It works over both symmetric networks and asymmetrical network topologies such as those provided by satellite, cable modem, or ADSL carriers. Before sending, each sender must connect with a trusted top node to receive permission and control parameters for its data stream. The top node provides network managers with a single point of control for the senders, allowing them to monitor and control the traffic being sent. RMTP-II builds on a rich field of existing work, and adds to it the following novel contributions. It differentiates the roles of the nodes in the protocol, provides algorithms for smoothing and control of the return (TRACK) traffic, and provides explicit support for highly asymmetrical networks. It provides explicit network management controls through a centralized point of control, a fully distributed membership protocol that enables positive confirmation of data delivery, and fault recovery algorithms which are integrated to the reliability semantics of the protocol. It includes a novel reliability level called time bounded reliability, and offers a unique combination of TRACKs, NACKs, and FEC for increased scalability and real-time performance. Finally, it integrates distributed algorithms for RTT calculation to each receiver, and provides automatic configuration of receiver nodes.","doi":"10.1109/65.819170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/17749/00819170.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.819170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of reliable multicast transport protocol II","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819170","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819170/","displayDocTitle":"An overview of reliable multicast transport protocol II","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6502065","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of reliable multicast transport protocol II","sourcePdf":"00819170.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041631S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 2000","isNumber":"17749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"57","articleId":"819170","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":819175,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

This technology also has wide application possibilities in other fields of radiology and in industrial imaging for applications in nondestructive evaluation and inspection. These detectors have potentially superior properties compared to either emulsion based film, which has nonlinear response to X-rays, or phosphor-based detectors in which there is an intermediate step of X-ray to light photon conversion. Potential advantages of direct conversion detectors are high quantum efficiencies (QE) of 98% or higher (for 0.3 mm thick CdZnTe detector with 20 keV X-rays), improved contrast, high sensitivity and low intrinsic noise. These factors are expected to contribute to high detective quantum efficiency (DQE). The prototype hybrid pixel detector developed has 50/spl times/50 microns pixel size, and is designed to have linear response to X-rays, and can support a dynamic range of 14 bits. Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) is measured on a l-mm silicon detector system where 10% or better modulations are obtained at 10 lp/mm spatial frequency. Preliminary DQE measurements of the same system yields a value of 55% at zero spatial frequency. Here, the authors report data of their first full size prototype readout ASIC chips hybridized with both silicon and CdZnTe detector arrays and present initial MTF and DQE measurement results as well as some test images.","doi":"10.1109/23.819287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.819287","endPage":"2097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/17754/00819287.pdf","startPage":"2093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid direct conversion detectors for digital mammography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819287/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid direct conversion detectors for digital mammography","volume":"46","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6501254","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid direct conversion detectors for digital mammography","sourcePdf":"00819287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047569S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"16","articleId":"819287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":819305,"authors":[{"name":"V.Y.

model-based or statistical analysis methods for functional MRI (fMRI) suffer from the limitation of the assumed paradigm and biased results. Temporal clustering methods, such as fuzzy clustering, can eliminate these problems but are difficult to find activation occupying a small area, sensitive to noise and initial values, and computationally demanding. To overcome these adversities, a cascade clustering method combining a Kohonen clustering network and fuzzy c means is developed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is used to compare this method with correlation coefficient analysis and t test on a series of testing phantoms. Results show that this method can efficiently and stably identify the actual functional response with typical signal change to noise ratio, from a small activation area occupying only 0.2% of head size, with phase delay, and from other noise sources such as head motion. With the ability of finding activities of small sizes stably, this method can not only identify the functional responses and the active regions more precisely, but also discriminate responses from different signal sources, such as large venous vessels or different types of activation patterns in human studies involving motor cortex activation. Even when the experimental paradigm is unknown in a blind test such that model-based methods are inapplicable, this method can identify the activation patterns and regions correctly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","volume":"18","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6508082","pubMedId":"10695525","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Model-free functional MRI analysis using Kohonen clustering neural network and fuzzy C-means","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-free functional MRI analysis using Kohonen clustering neural network and fuzzy C-means","sourcePdf":"00819322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058328S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"113","articleId":"819322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":819324,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These shape features are used in a classification system to classify masses as round, nodular, or stellate. The multiresolution shape features are compared with traditional uniresolution shape features for their class discriminating abilities. The study involved 60 digitized mammographic images. The masses were segmented manually by radiologists, prior to introduction to the classification system. The uniresolution and multiresolution shape features were calculated using the radial distance measure of the mass boundaries. The discriminating power of the shape features were analyzed via linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The classification system utilized a simple Euclidean metric to determine class membership.

Unlike other similar algorithms, programming handiness was provided to select basic speech characteristics to be considered for patient hearing. The implementation of this filter-bank algorithm on cochlear-prosthesis' DSP-board enables to generate and to control electrical stimulating pulses. In conventional hearing aids driven by DSP, a filter bank-based algorithm permits an ease adjustment of speech amplification, which is fully programmable within the considered sounds' spectrum. In each device, a programmable spectrum cut-up permits to adjust filters' bands relatively to patient's pathology. Programming via a host computer enable flexibility in speech amplification for conventional hearing aids and in cochlea's stimulation for cochlear prostheses. It combines handiness, ease of use and safety features to help meet individual's diverse needs. A computer illustration, based on spectrum cutting-up, was designed to identify filters' outputs. Hence, with this visual measure, clinicians could set up experiments for adjusting correctly hearing aid's operation-parameters.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1999.819380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1999.819380","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1192 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON'99.

Typically, it comprises a camera system and a precision linear stage. In this paper, the development of a motion control system used in the authors' prototype leads inspection system is presented. High performance is obtained by using a permanent magnet DC linear motor as the actuator for the linear stage, which eliminates the needs of mechanical transmission from the rotary to linear motion. Fast and accurate servo response is achieved by using a state space predictive controller with feedforward compensation of friction. The controller is optimally tuned using the genetic algorithm. The experimental system has a positioning accuracy of 1 /spl mu/m and a peak speed of more than 1 m/s.

Based on the flight time measurement principle, it uses a phase-shift conversion method which is achieved by the undersampling technique. Firstly, the authors remind readers of the synchronous demodulation principle and present the undersampling technique. Then the corresponding phase-shift measurement unit working at a 10 MHz modulation frequency is described. The choice of the sampling frequency, related to the modulation frequency, is important and leads to a very interesting simplification of the digital process. Performance evaluation of this unit shows a good accuracy in phase-shift estimation. The system is designed to be integrated in a complete autonomous device. An important evolution of the system is introduced in order to feature a high second modulation frequency at 240 MHz, which is required for high accuracy measurement. Nevertheless the new system keeps a rather simple architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-3 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522352","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital laser range finder: phase-shift estimation by undersampling technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital laser range finder: phase-shift estimation by undersampling technique","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00819401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031993S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6620","citationCount":"7","articleId":"819401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":819417,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper discusses a dynamic modeling method applied to the interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor with skewed stator slots by integrating two-dimensional electromagnetic field solutions with the electric circuit model. A multi-segment technique was applied to model the skew effect. Phenomena such as saturation and rotor saliency are taken into considerations in the suggested modeling method. The IPM motor performance characteristics under various operating conditions are investigated. Particular attention is paid to the motor torque, speed and induced back EMF responses. Experimental and simulation results of the motor model are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6522378","conferenceDate":"29 Nov.-3 Dec. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic model of interior permanent magnet motor with skewed stator slots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic model of interior permanent magnet motor with skewed stator slots","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00819441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032299S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6620","citationCount":"5","articleId":"819441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":819462,"authors":[{"name":"C.

An important criteria is that the detection system be easily configurable to a new domain or environment. In this paper, we present work on a general object detection system that can be trained to detect different types of objects; we focus on the task of pedestrian detection. This paradigm of learning from examples allows us to avoid the need for a hand-crafted solution. Unlike many pedestrian detection systems, the core technique does not rely on motion information and makes no assumptions on the scene structured or the number of objects present. We discuss an extension to the system that takes advantage of dynamical information when processing video sequences to enhance accuracy. We also describe a real, real-time version of the system that has been integrated into a DaimlerChrysler test vehicle.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17687/00819462.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"39 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.819462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.819462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trainable pedestrian detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Robustness","Automotive engineering","Machine vision","Motion detection","Layout","Video sequences","Real time systems","System testing","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","image sequences","video signal processing","automated highways","learning by example","automobiles","traffic engineering computing","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trainable pedestrian detection","robust fast object detection systems","automotive vision systems","learning from examples","dynamical information","video sequence processing","accuracy","real-time system","DaimlerChrysler test vehicle"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Trainable pedestrian detection","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trainable pedestrian detection","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00819462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045086S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"79","articleId":"819462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":819465,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The smooth areas can be well represented by a wavelet transform with high regularity and with fewer coefficients which requires high-pass filters with some vanishing moments. However for the regions around edges, short highpass filters are preferable. In one recently proposed approach, this problem was solved by switching filter banks using longer filters for smoothed areas of the images and shorter filters for areas with edges. This approach was applied to lossy image coding resulting in a reduction of ringing artifacts. As edges were predicted using neighboring pixels the nonlinear transforms made the decorrelation more flexible. In this paper we propose a time-varying filterbank and apply it to lossless image coding. In this scheme, we estimate the standard deviation of the neighboring pixels of the current pixel by solving the maximum likelihood problem. The filterbank is switched between three filter banks, depending on the estimated standard deviation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17687/00819465.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"52 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.819465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.819465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-varying wavelet transforms with lifting steps for lossless image compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image coding","Filter bank","Image segmentation","Satellites","Pixel","Art","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","image coding","decorrelation","data compression","maximum likelihood estimation","time-varying filters","high-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying wavelet transforms","lifting steps","lossless image compression","wavelet transform","high-pass filters","switching filter banks","lossy image coding","ringing artifacts","neighboring pixels","decorrelation","time-varying filterbank","lossless image coding","maximum likelihood problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Time-varying wavelet transforms with lifting steps for lossless image compression","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522039","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-varying wavelet transforms with lifting steps for lossless image compression","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00819465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059013S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"3","articleId":"819465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":819467,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Even with substantial investment in 3G infrastructure, the radio spectrum allocated to 3G will be limited. Cognitive radio offers a mechanism for the flexible pooling of radio spectrum using a new class of protocols called formal radio etiquettes. This approach could expand the bandwidth available for conventional uses (e.g. police, fire and rescue) and extend the spatial coverage of 3G in a novel way. Cognitive radio is a particular extension of software radio that employs model-based reasoning about users, multimedia content, and communications context.

However, efficient wireless data connectivity is difficult to achieve due to physical and technological limitations. In this paper, we propose a proxy server architecture that facilitates highly effective latency reduction over the wireless link without modifying any of the existing applications. Based on the capabilities of the client devices, Web browsers, the user preferences, and Web content types, several different levels of wireless-adaptation for Web content are performed. The functions included in the wireless-adaptation are general-purpose lossless data compression, data-type specific lossy compression and re-authoring of HTML documents. We show the improvement in the retrieval time through experiments in which a mobile host accesses the WWW via the proxy architecture over a CDMA cellular network.","doi":"10.1109/MOMUC.1999.819513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOMUC.1999.819513","startPage":"368","endPage":"372","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE International Workshop on Mobile Multimedia Communications (MoMuC'99) (Cat.

This approach is based on a formulation of blind separation as a problem of learning and inference in a dynamic graphical model. In this model, the sources are described by independent hidden Markov models, which capture not only the one-point histogram but also temporal structure of the sources. Using the model, we derive unsupervised learning algorithms that learn the source densities and temporal structure, as well as the mixing matrix, from the observed data. Inference in this model provides an optimal reconstruction of the sources from data. We demonstrate an expectation maximization algorithm for square, zero noise mixing, and algorithms for the general case, where the number of sources may differ from the number of observed mixtures and the data are noisy. In the latter case, the complexity of the graphical model makes exact learning and inference computationally intractable. An approximate algorithm based on the variational approach, which maximizes a lower bound on the likelihood, is presented and shown to be quite accurate.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 Ninth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ICANN 99.

The main characteristics of the MRHF are the good noise attenuation property in smooth areas and the preservation of edges end details. In fact, in changing areas the noise attenuation is traded for a good response to the change. Moreover, the median filters effectively remove the impulsive noise while the rational filter performs well in relatively high SNR Gaussian contaminated environments. Another relevant characteristic is that MRHF's usually act on small windows and thus require a reduced number of operations, resulting in simple and fast filtering structures. In this paper we present a programmable hardware implementation for the MRHF's. Exploiting the features of the dynamic logic families it is possible to achieve high speed and compactness, while keeping the power dissipation very low.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable hardware implementation for the median-rational hybrid filters","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.819574","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17687/00819574.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"186 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.819574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Programmable hardware implementation for the median-rational hybrid filters","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522066","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable hardware implementation for the median-rational hybrid filters","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00819574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040893S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","articleId":"819574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":819576,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The scheme is based on the representation of the face images using the so called eigenfaces, generated performing a PCA (Principal Components Analysis). The data base used was designed for still image recognition and the corresponding images were very controlled. That is, the test images had controlled expression, orientation and lighting variations. Preliminary results were shown using only a frontal view image by person in the training set. In this paper, we present our first results for face recognition of video sequences. To that end, we have modified our original scheme in such a way that is able to cope with the different face conditions present in a video sequence. The main and final objective is to develop a tool to be used in the MPEG-7 standardization effort to help video indexing activities. The system is not yet fully automatic, but an automatic facial point location is under development. Good results have been obtained using the video test sequences used in the MPEG-7 evaluation group.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.819576","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17687/00819576.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.819576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition of video sequences in a MPEG-7 context using a global eigen approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819576/","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition of video sequences in a MPEG-7 context using a global eigen approach","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522067","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition of video sequences in a MPEG-7 context using a global eigen approach","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00819576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02638S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"6","articleId":"819576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":819578,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

When these facial parts are hindered by additional objects (eyeglasses, beard, injury, etc.), the feature extraction from facial image will not be accurate. In this paper, we focus on the eyeglass faces because they account for 40% of population in Japan, and present a method of the removal of eyeglass frame in facial images with eyeglasses using principal component analysts. Two approaches are discussed for removal of eyeglasses in facial image. The first method calculates basis vectors from many eyeglassless facial images and one eyeglass facial image, and reconstructs the facial image with the basis vectors which include no feature of eyeglass frame. The second method calculates basis vectors from a set of eyeglassless facial images, and reconstructs the facial image using the values of inner product of the basis vectors and an eyeglass facial image. The former obtains the images which restrain. The features of eyeglass frame while loses the facial individuality a little. The latter obtains a natural eyeglassless facial image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819578/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522069","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of eyeglassless facial images using principal component analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of eyeglassless facial images using principal component analysis","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00819578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02299S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"31","articleId":"819578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":819593,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

We focus on MPEG-2 to H.263 transcoding, however these results can be extended to other lower-rate video compression standards including MPEG-4 simple profile and MPEG-1. A conventional approach to the transcoding problem involves decoding the input bitstream, spatially and temporally downsampling the decoded frames, and re-encoding the result. The proposed transcoder achieves improved performance by exploiting the details of the MPEG-2 and H.263 compression standards when performing interlaced to progressive (or field to frame) conversion with spatial downsampling and frame-rate reduction. The transcoder reduces the MPEG-2 decoding requirements by temporally downsampling the data at the bitstream level and reduces the H.263 encoding requirements by largely bypassing H.263 motion estimation by reusing the motion vectors and coding modes given in the input bitstream. In software implementations, the proposed approach achieved a 5/spl times/ speedup over the conventional approach with only a 0.3 and 0.5 dB loss in PSNR for the Carousel and Bus sequences.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1999.819593","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 International Conference on Image Processing (Cat. 99CH36348)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6632/17687/00819593.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"275 vol.4","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1999.819593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field-to-frame transcoding with spatial and temporal downsampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"Field-to-frame transcoding with spatial and temporal downsampling","isConference":true,"volume":"4","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6514325","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field-to-frame transcoding with spatial and temporal downsampling","confLoc":"Kobe","sourcePdf":"00819593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053393S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"26","articleId":"819593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":819594,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

In applications such as video browsing, and picture in picture, for a lower bitrate, there is a need to down-sample the video before transmission. The conventional approach to downscale a compressed video sequence is to decompress it at the video server, perform the down-sampling in the pixel domain and then recompress it for efficient delivery. This process is computationally intensive due to the motion estimation process required during the recompression phase. In the alternative compressed domain approach, the motion vectors of the downscaled video sequence are computed directly from the motion vectors of the original full size stream. In this paper we propose a compressed domain technique that generates a better estimate for the downscaled motion vectors. Simulations suggest that the performance achieved with the proposed method is superior by up to 1 dB to the current compressed domain techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6522078","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Compressed domain motion vector resampling for downscaling of MPEG video","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed domain motion vector resampling for downscaling of MPEG video","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00819594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032262S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6632","citationCount":"9","articleId":"819594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":819630,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Gaohong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wu Gaohong","id":"37088041480"},{"name":"Zhang Yujin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Zhang Yujin","id":"37088041948"},{"name":"Lin Xinggang","lastName":"Lin Xinggang","id":"37086986933"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5467-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"819630","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms","Image texture analysis","Classification algorithms","Frequency","Low pass filters","Image analysis","Signal analysis","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","image classification","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform-based texture classification","feature weighting","Daubechies orthogonal wavelets","standard pyramid-structured wavelet transform","texture classification","minimum distance classifier"]}],"abstract":"A new approach to wavelet transform-based texture classification using feature weighting is presented.

Here neural network model development is carried out using imperfect data, typical of that collected in many manufacturing environments, and addresses issues pertinent to real-world use. Predictions then are presented in terms that are relevant to the machine operator, as a measure of paper acceptability, a direct prediction of the quality measure, and always with a measure of prediction confidence.

This paper considers the reasons underlying this difficulty by considering the relationship between the dynamics of the network and weight-space. We show that the dynamics required for the solution lie in a region of weight-space close to a bifurcation point where small changes in weights may result in radically different network behaviour. Furthermore, we show that the error gradient information in this region is highly irregular. We conclude that any gradient-based learning method will experience difficulty in learning the language due to the nature of the space, and that a more promising approach to improving learning performance may be to make weight changes in a non-independent manner.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19991135","publicationTitle":"1999 Ninth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ICANN 99.

Input information about the length of a time series up to a certain point in time may act as a decreasing threshold making the network more and more sensible to changes in other input features. The advantages of the two methods are demonstrated by means of a real-world application example, tool wear monitoring in turning.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19991153","startPage":"467","endPage":"472 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1999 Ninth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ICANN 99.

Indeed, the field of evolutionary computation is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science and engineering for just this reason; it is addressing many problems that were previously beyond reach, such as rapid design of medicines, flexible solutions to supply-chain management problems, and rapid analysis of battlefield tactics for defense. Potentially, the field may fulfil the dream of artificial intelligence: a computer that can learn on its own and become an expert in any chosen area.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/17780/00819926.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","doi":"10.1109/6.819926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.819926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What is evolutionary computation?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Evolution (biology)","Cost function","Sea measurements","Joining processes","Organisms","Accidents","Chaos","Heuristic algorithms","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","complex problems solutions evolution","complex engineering problems","chaotic disturbances","randomness","complex nonlinear dynamics","supply-chain management","battlefield tactics","artificial intelligence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"What is evolutionary computation?","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What is evolutionary computation?","sourcePdf":"0200-0262Evolutionlo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031047S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"86","articleId":"819926","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":819927,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The compact design and simple operation of magnetoelectronic devices make them ideal storage cells for fast random-access memory (RAM). Prototypes improve by several orders of magnitude on the speed, power, and reliability of semiconducting floating-gate nonvolatile memory and have achieved cell sizes and operating speeds that are competitive with dynamic (volatile) RAM. Further off in the future is the intriguing prospect of instantaneously reprogrammable logic.

The belief that it should be easy to find anyone, anywhere, at any time with a few pushes of a button has caught on with the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS). People imagine a miniature device, attached to one's person, that reports ones whereabouts almost instantaneously. Add the highly practical need to find missing persons promptly, and the personal locator system (PLS) industry is born. Systems of this nature, whether based on the GPS or some other technology, are being tested throughout the world. The architecture of a PLS is outlined. Six technologies for PLS are discussed: signal direction, signal times of arrival, GPS, server-assisted GPS, enhanced signal strength, and location fingerprinting. The importance to society of this technology is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/17780/00819928.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","doi":"10.1109/6.819928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.819928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=819928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal locator services emerge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Senior citizens","Global Positioning System","Companies","Urban areas","System testing","Vehicles","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio applications","radio direction-finding","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal locator services","metropolitan area","personal locator device","Global Positioning System","GPS","missing persons location","signal direction","signal times of arrival","server-assisted GPS","enhanced signal strength","location fingerprinting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"Personal locator services emerge","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6501294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal locator services emerge","sourcePdf":"0200-0412Locator.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061108S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"17780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"64","articleId":"819928","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":819945,"authors":[{"name":"Neungsoo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Systems, EEE-200C, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Neungsoo Park","id":"37336529200"},{"name":"V.K.

In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for array redistribution from cyclic(x) on P processors to cyclic(Kx) on Q processors. The algorithm reduces the overall time for communication by considering the data transfer, communication schedule, and index computation costs. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized circulant matrix formalism. Our algorithm generates a schedule that minimizes the number of communication steps and eliminates node contention in each communication step. The network bandwidth is fully utilized by ensuring that equal-sized messages are transferred in each communication step. Furthermore, the time to compute the schedule and the index sets is significantly smaller. It takes O(max(P, Q)) time and is less than 1 percent of the data transfer time. In comparison, the schedule computation time using the state-of-the-art scheme (which is based on the bipartite matching scheme) is 10 to 50 percent of the data transfer time for similar problem sizes. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is suitable for run-time array redistribution. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we have implemented the algorithm using C and MPI on an IBM SP2. Results show that our algorithm performs better than the previous algorithms with respect to the total redistribution time, which includes the time for data transfer, schedule, and index computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6510771","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Efficient algorithms for block-cyclic array redistribution between processor sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient algorithms for block-cyclic array redistribution between processor sets","sourcePdf":"00819945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062227S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"27","articleId":"819945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":819949,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Clearly, any protocol performing these tasks on n items must perform /sup n///sub k/ broadcast rounds because each item must be broadcast at least once. We begin by presenting an optimal off-line permutation routing protocol using /sup n///sub k/ broadcast rounds for arbitrary k, p, and n. Further, we show that optimal on-line routing can be performed in /sup n///sub k/ broadcast rounds, provided that either k=1 or p=n. We then go on to develop an online routing protocol that takes 2/sup n///sub k/+k-1 broadcast rounds on the MRN(p,k), whenever k/spl les//spl radic//sup p///sub 2/. Using these routing protocols as basic building blocks, we develop a ranking protocol that takes 2/sup n///sub k/+o(/sup n///sub k/) broadcast rounds as well as a sorting protocol that takes 3/sup n///sub k/+o(/sup n///sub k/) broadcast rounds, provided that k /spl epsiv/ o(/spl radic/n) and p=n. Finally, we develop a ranking protocol that takes 3/sup n///sub k/+o(/sup n///sub k/) broadcast rounds, as well as a sorting protocol that takes 4/sup n///sub k/+o(/sup n///sub k/) broadcast rounds on the MRN(p,k), provided that k/spl les//spl radic//sup p///sub 2/ and p /spl epsiv/ o(n). Featuring very low proportionality constants, our protocols offer a vast improvement over the state of the art.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio broadcasting","Land mobile radio","Routing protocols","Sorting","Radio network","Mobile computing","Computer networks","Wireless networks","Multiaccess communication","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","transport protocols","personal communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast-efficient protocols","mobile radio networks","permutation routing","ranking","optimal off-line permutation routing protocol","ranking protocol","proportionality constants","single-hop networks","DAMA"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.819949","startPage":"1276","endPage":"1289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/17782/00819949.pdf","doi":"10.1109/71.819949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcast-efficient protocols for mobile radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast-efficient protocols for mobile radio networks","accessionNumber":"6510775","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","volume":"10","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/819949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast-efficient protocols for mobile radio networks","sourcePdf":"00819949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049808S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"34","articleId":"819949","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":819977,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

AFM probe is proposed to be utilized as a mechanically contact pushing manipulator, and force and topology sensor. The focused task is the 2-D pushing of micro/nanometer size particles on a substrate in ambient conditions. Thus, the modeling of interaction forces and dynamics during pushing operation is analyzed for understanding the nano scale physical phenomenon which is different from macro robotics physics.
