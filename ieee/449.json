However, recognition accuracy is degraded by environmental noise at the input, quantization distortion, and transmission errors. In this paper, histogram-based quantization (HQ) is proposed, in which the partition cells for quantization are dynamically defined by the histogram or order statistics of a segment of the most recent past values of the parameter to be quantized. This scheme is shown to be able to solve to a good degree many problems related to DSR. A joint uncertainty decoding (JUD) approach is further developed to consider the uncertainty caused by both environmental noise and quantization errors. A three-stage error concealment (EC) framework is also developed to handle transmission errors. The proposed HQ is shown to be an attractive feature transformation approach for robust speech recognition outside of a DSR environment as well. All the claims have been verified by experiments using the Aurora 2 testing environment, and significant performance improvements for both robust and/or distributed speech recognition over conventional approaches have been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.920891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4489993/04490004.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.920891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4489993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histogram-Based Quantization for Robust and/or Distributed Speech Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490004/","displayDocTitle":"Histogram-Based Quantization for Robust and/or Distributed Speech Recognition","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9966059","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490004/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histogram-Based Quantization for Robust and/or Distributed Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"16tasl04-wan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088583S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4489993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4489993","articleId":"4490004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4490019,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For many current applications, ATR is performed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly within a reconnaissance area to collect image data through sensors and upload the data to a central ground control station for analyzing and identifying potential targets. The centralized approach to ATR introduces several problems, including scalability with the number of UAVs, network delays in communicating with the central location, and the susceptibility of the system to malicious attacks on the central location. These challenges can be addressed by using a distributed system for performing ATR. In this paper, we describe a multiagent-based prototype system that uses swarming techniques inspired from insect colonies to perform ATR using UAVs in a distributed manner within simulated scenarios. We assume that UAVs are constrained in the resources available onboard and in their capabilities for performing ATR due to payload limitations. Our focus in this paper is on the coordination aspects between UAVs to efficiently decide how they are to act by using a swarming mechanism. We describe algorithms for the different operations performed by the UAVs in the system and for different swarming strategies, which are embedded within software agents located on the UAVs. We provide empirical simulations of our system within a simulated area of interest to determine its behavior in different scenarios with varying operational constraints. Our experimental results indicate that swarming strategies for distributed ATR perform favorably compared with centralized ATR strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.918619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4490029/04490035.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.918619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiagent Swarming System for Distributed Automatic Target Recognition Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490035/","displayDocTitle":"A Multiagent Swarming System for Distributed Automatic Target Recognition Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921576","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490035/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiagent Swarming System for Distributed Automatic Target Recognition Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"38tsmca03-dasgupta.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08619S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4490029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4490029","articleId":"4490035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4490037,"authors":[{"name":"Crina Grosan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4490029/4490037/4490037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Crina Grosan received the M.S. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj Napoca, Romania, in 2005.","She is currently a Lecturer of artificial intelligence with Babes-Bolyai University and was a Researcher with the Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems, Centre of Excellence, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

Every equation in the system represents an objective function whose goal is to minimize the difference between the right and left terms of the corresponding equation. An evolutionary computation technique is applied to solve the problem obtained by transforming the system into a multiobjective optimization problem. The results obtained are compared with a very new technique that is considered as efficient and is also compared with some of the standard techniques that are used for solving nonlinear equations systems. Several well-known and difficult applications (such as interval arithmetic benchmark, kinematic application, neuropsychology application, combustion application, and chemical equilibrium application) are considered for testing the performance of the new approach. Empirical results reveal that the proposed approach is able to deal with high-dimensional equations systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2008.918599","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","startPage":"698","endPage":"714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2008.918599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490029","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4490029/04490037.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear equations","Difference equations","Evolutionary computation","Arithmetic","Benchmark testing","Kinematics","Combustion","Chemicals","Intelligent systems","Intelligent robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","iterative methods","minimisation","nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex nonlinear equation solving","multiobjective optimization problem","evolutionary computation technique","minimization problem","iterative method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational intelligence","evolutionary multiobjective optimization","metaheuristics","nonlinear equation systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Solving Nonlinear Equations Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490037/","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4490037/","accessionNumber":"9921580","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Solving Nonlinear Equations Systems","sourcePdf":"38tsmca03-grosan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139313S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4490029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4490029","articleId":"4490037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4490039,"authors":[{"name":"Christos D.

Participants were professionals, half of whom had intelligence analysis experience. The effectiveness of a procedure designed to mitigate the confirmation bias, called analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH), was tested. Results showed a confirmation bias for both experience groups, but ACH significantly reduced bias only for participants without intelligence analysis experience. Confirmation bias manifested as a weighting bias, not as an interpretation bias. Participants tended to agree on the interpretation of evidence (i.e., whose hypothesis was supported by the evidence) but tended to disagree on the importance of the evidence-giving more weight to the evidence that supported their preferred hypothesis and less weight to evidence that disconfirmed it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490040/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921583","volume":"38","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Confirmation Bias in Complex Analyses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Confirmation Bias in Complex Analyses","sourcePdf":"38tsmca03-lehner.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118466S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4490029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4490029","articleId":"4490040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4490049,"authors":[{"name":"Henrik Aan\u00c6s","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4490048/4490049/4490049-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Henrik Aan\u00e6s received the M.Sc. degree in engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in computer vision and image analysis with the Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark.

This framework enables the formulation of the regularization in a way that corresponds well with our prior assumptions of the image data. The proposed method is validated and compared with other approaches on several data sets. Lastly, the intensity-hue-saturation method is revisited in order to gain additional insight of what implications the spectral consistency has for an image fusion method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4490049/","accessionNumber":"9921396","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Satellite Image Fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Satellite Image Fusion","sourcePdf":"46tgrs05-aanaes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072061S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4490048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4490048","articleId":"4490049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4490055,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Dalponte","affiliation":["Department of Information and CommunicationTechnology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy","Centro di Ecologia Alpina, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4490048/4490055/4490055-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Dalponte (S'07) received the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2006, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is with the Remote Sensing Laboratory, Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, and also with the Centro di Ecologia Alpina, Trento.

Typically, these feature space projections are suboptimal. In a typical hyperspectral ATR setup, the number of training signatures (ground truth) is often less than the dimensionality of the signatures. Standard dimensionality reduction tools such as LDA and PCA cannot be applied in such situations. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer approach that addresses this problem for robust ATR. We partition the hyperspectral space into contiguous subspaces based on the optimization of a performance metric. We then make local classification decisions in every subspace using a multiclassifier system and employ a decision fusion system for making the final decision on the class label. In this work, we propose a metric that incorporates higher order statistical information for accurate partitioning of the hyperspectral space. We also propose an adaptive weight assignment method in the decision fusion process based on the strengths (as measured by the training accuracies) of individual classifiers that made the local decisions. The proposed methods are tested using hyperspectral data with known ground truth, such that the efficacy can be quantitatively measured in terms of target recognition accuracies. The proposed system was found to significantly outperform conventional approaches. For example, under moderate pixel mixing, the proposed approach resulted in classification accuracies around 90%, where traditional feature fusion resulted in accuracies around 65%.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.916207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4490048/04490066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.916207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490048","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision Fusion With Confidence-Based Weight Assignment for Hyperspectral Target Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decision Fusion With Confidence-Based Weight Assignment for Hyperspectral Target Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921411","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4490066/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision Fusion With Confidence-Based Weight Assignment for Hyperspectral Target Recognition","sourcePdf":"46tgrs05-prasad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063002S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4490048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4490048","articleId":"4490066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4490068,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay P.

Wavelets and principal component analysis (PCA) methods have been a popular choice for spatial and spectral transformations, respectively. Current PCA-based pan-sharpening methods make an assumption that the first principal component (PC) of high variance is an ideal choice for replacing or injecting it with high spatial details from the high-resolution histogram-matched panchromatic (PAN) image. This paper presents a combined adaptive PCA-contourlet approach for pan-sharpening, where the adaptive PCA is used to reduce the spectral distortion and the use of nonsubsampled contourlets for spatial transformation in pan-sharpening is incorporated to overcome the limitation of the wavelets in representing the directional information efficiently and capturing intrinsic geometrical structures of the objects. The efficiency of the presented method is tested by performing pan-sharpening of the high-resolution (IKONOS and QuickBird) and the medium-resolution (Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) datasets. The evaluation of the pan-sharpened images using global validation indexes reveal that the adaptive PCA approach helps reducing the spectral distortion, and its merger with contourlets provides better fusion results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4490048/04490068.pdf","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.916211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.916211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Pan-Sharpening Method via a Combined Adaptive PCA Approach and Contourlets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Spatial resolution","Signal resolution","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image resolution","Image fusion","Multispectral imaging","Wavelet analysis","Remote sensing","Optical distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","image resolution","multidimensional signal processing","principal component analysis","remote sensing","sensor fusion","spectral analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pan sharpening method","contourlets","neighboring pixels","multispectral image","data transformation","wavelet transformation","adaptive principal component analysis","spatial transformation","spectral transformation","high-resolution histogram-matched panchromatic image","spectral distortion","directional information","object geometrical structure","IKONOS image","QuickBird image","Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image","image fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contourlets","image fusion","pan-sharpening","principal component analysis (PCA)","wavelets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Pan-Sharpening Method via a Combined Adaptive PCA Approach and Contourlets","volume":"46","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4490068/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921414","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Pan-Sharpening Method via a Combined Adaptive PCA Approach and Contourlets","sourcePdf":"46tgrs05-shah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161042S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4490048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"331","xplore-issue":"4490048","articleId":"4490068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4490076,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.","Brain Research Center"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4490069/4490076/4490076-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Teng Lin (F'05) received the B.S. degree in control engineering from National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan, in 1986, and both the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.

However, most of the existing physiological signal monitoring systems can only record the signals without the capability of automatic analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system that can acquire and analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in real-time to monitor human physiological as well as cognitive states, and, in turn, provide warning signals to the users when needed. The BCI system consists of a four-channel biosignal acquisition/amplification module, a wireless transmission module, a dual-core signal processing unit, and a host system for display and storage. The embedded dual-core processing system with multitask scheduling capability was proposed to acquire and process the input EEG signals in real time. In addition, the wireless transmission module, which eliminates the inconvenience of wiring, can be switched between radio frequency (RF) and Bluetooth according to the transmission distance. Finally, the real-time EEG-based drowsiness monitoring and warning algorithms were implemented and integrated into the system to close the loop of the BCI system. The practical online testing demonstrates the feasibility of using the proposed system with the ability of real-time processing, automatic analysis, and online warning feedback in real-world operation and living environments.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.918566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4490069/04490076.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.918566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490069","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of Wireless Brain Computer Interface With Embedded Multitask Scheduling and its Application on Real-Time Driver's Drowsiness Detection and Warning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of Wireless Brain Computer Interface With Embedded Multitask Scheduling and its Application on Real-Time Driver's Drowsiness Detection and Warning","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921383","pubMedId":"18440904","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4490076/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Wireless Brain Computer Interface With Embedded Multitask Scheduling and its Application on Real-Time Driver's Drowsiness Detection and Warning","sourcePdf":"55tbme05-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076619S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4490069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4490069","articleId":"4490076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4490088,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Manstretta","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Manstretta","id":"37326141100"},{"name":"Nicola Laurenti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Laurenti","id":"37375265900"},{"name":"Rinaldo Castello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Rinaldo","lastName":"Castello","id":"37267924000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4490088","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Interference","Linearity","Receivers","AWGN","Frequency division multiplexing","Ultra wideband technology","Intermodulation distortion","Frequency conversion","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","impedance matching","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation","receivers","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable UWB receiver","narrow-band MB-OFDM UWB receiver","interference analysis","reconfigurable narrow-band architecture","broadband impedance matching","out-of-band linearity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Harmonic distortion","intermodulation distortion","multiband (MB)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","radio receivers","ultra-wide-band (UWB)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an analysis on the receiver front-end architectures for multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing ultra-wide-band (UWB) terminals.

The centralized solution to the problem uses a fusion center, thus, requiring a large amount of energy for communication. Incremental strategies that obtain the global solution have been proposed, but they require the definition of a cycle through the network. We propose a diffusion recursive least-squares algorithm where nodes need to communicate only with their closest neighbors. The algorithm has no topology constraints, and requires no transmission or inversion of matrices, therefore saving in communications and complexity. We show that the algorithm is stable and analyze its performance comparing it to the centralized global solution. We also show how to select the combination weights optimally.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"56","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9921321","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4490095/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diffusion recursive least-squares for distributed estimation over adaptive networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffusion recursive least-squares for distributed estimation over adaptive networks","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-cattivelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094478S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"386","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4490095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4490096,"authors":[{"name":"Venkat Chandrasekaran","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4490093/4490096/4490096-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Venkat Chandrasekaran (S'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, the B.A. degree in mathematics from Rice University, Houston, TX, in 2005, and the S.M. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2007, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree with the Stochastic Systems Group.","His research interests include statistical signal processing, machine learning, and computational harmonic analysis."]},"firstName":"Venkat","lastName":"Chandrasekaran","id":"37283868800"},{"name":"Jason K.

Due to their sophisticated modeling capabilities, they have found applications in a variety of fields such as computer vision, image processing, and distributed sensor networks. In this paper, we present a general class of algorithms for estimation in Gaussian graphical models with arbitrary structure. These algorithms involve a sequence of inference problems on tractable subgraphs over subsets of variables. This framework includes parallel iterations such as embedded trees, serial iterations such as block Gauss-Seidel, and hybrid versions of these iterations. We also discuss a method that uses local memory at each node to overcome temporary communication failures that may arise in distributed sensor network applications. We analyze these algorithms based on the recently developed walk-sum interpretation of Gaussian inference. We describe the walks ldquocomputedrdquo by the algorithms using walk-sum diagrams, and show that for iterations based on a very large and flexible set of sequences of subgraphs, convergence is guaranteed in walk-summable models. Consequently, we are free to choose spanning trees and subsets of variables adaptively at each iteration. This leads to efficient methods for optimizing the next iteration step to achieve maximum reduction in error. Simulation results demonstrate that these nonstationary algorithms provide a significant speedup in convergence over traditional one-tree and two-tree iterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4490096/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921322","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimation in Gaussian Graphical Models Using Tractable Subgraphs: A Walk-Sum Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation in Gaussian Graphical Models Using Tractable Subgraphs: A Walk-Sum Analysis","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-chandrasekaran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130867S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4490096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4490103,"authors":[{"name":"Anne Ferreol","affiliation":["Thales Communications, Colombes, France","CNRS, SATIE, ENS Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Ferreol","id":"37265599200"},{"name":"Pascal Larzabal","affiliation":["CNRS, SATIE, ENS Cachan, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Larzabal","id":"38558950400"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37268515700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4490103","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Resolution Probability of MUSIC in Presence of Modeling Errors","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> The problem of resolving closely spaced signal sources using an antenna array remains a difficult one, although several estimation methods are available in the literature. When the array correlation matrix is known, the resolution capability of subspace algorithms is infinitely high. However, in the presence of modeling errors the resolution deteriorates, even for a known correlation matrix. In this paper, we analyze the MUSIC method, by way of three different definitions of the resolution. Assuming Gaussian circular random modeling errors, we determine the corresponding expressions of the probability of source resolution versus the model mismatch. A first series of simulations validates the mathematical expression of the three resolution probabilities. A second series of simulations is used to select among them the tightest one to the empirical one. The results are useful, e.g., for determining the necessary antenna calibration accuracy to achieve a target performance. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.911482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.911482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490093","startPage":"1945","endPage":"1953","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4490093/04490103.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490103","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiple signal classification","Signal resolution","Calibration","Signal processing algorithms","Transmission line matrix methods","Context modeling","Antenna arrays","Estimation error","Direction of arrival estimation","Planar arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","correlation methods","direction-of-arrival estimation","error statistics","Gaussian processes","matrix algebra","sensor arrays","signal classification","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MUSIC resolution probability","antenna array signal estimation","array correlation matrix","multiple signal classification","Gaussian circular random modeling error","antenna calibration accuracy","DOA estimation","sensor array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOA estimation","modeling errors","performances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Resolution Probability of MUSIC in Presence of Modeling Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921329","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490103/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Resolution Probability of MUSIC in Presence of Modeling Errors","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-ferreol.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073195S","chronDate":"May  2008","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"4490103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4490112,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Pezeshki","affiliation":["Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4490093/4490112/4490112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Pezeshki (S'95\u2013M'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Colorado State University, Ft.

The unknown orientation may be fixed, in which case the signal covariance is rank-1, or it may be random, in which case the signal covariance is multirank. We present a systematic treatment of such signal models and explain their relevance for modeling signal uncertainties. We then present a multirank generalization of the MVDR beamformer. The idea is to minimize the power at the output of a matrix beamformer, while enforcing a data dependent distortionless constraint in the signal subspace, which we design based on the type of signal we wish to resolve. We show that the eigenvalues of an error covariance matrix are fundamental for resolving signals of interest. Signals with rank-1 covariances are resolved by the largest eigenvalues of the error covariance, while signals with multirank covariances are resolved by the smallest eigenvalues. Thus, the beamformers we design are eigenvalue beamformers, which extract signal information from eigen-modes of an error covariance. We address the tradeoff between angular resolution of eigenvalue beamformers and the fraction of the signal power they capture.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.912248","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4490093/04490112.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.912248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1954","endPage":"1967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigenvalue Beamforming Using a Multirank MVDR Beamformer and Subspace Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Eigenvalue Beamforming Using a Multirank MVDR Beamformer and Subspace Selection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490112/","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4490112/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921345","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenvalue Beamforming Using a Multirank MVDR Beamformer and Subspace Selection","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-pezeshki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108035S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4490112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4490114,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Rey Vega","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4490093/4490114/4490114-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Rey Vega was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1979.

The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart. The GPU's rapid increase in both programmability and capability has spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU. This effort in general-purpose computing on the GPU, also known as GPU computing, has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems of the future.

We present an iterative algorithm for estimating multipath complex gains with intersubcarrier interference (ICI) mitigation (using comb-type pilots). Each complex gain variation is approximated by a polynomial representation within several OFDM symbols. Assuming knowledge of delay-related information, polynomial coefficients are obtained from time-averaged gain values, which are estimated using the least-square (LS) criterion. The channel matrix is easily computed, and the ICI is reduced by using successive interference suppression (SIS) during data symbol detection. The algorithm's performance is further enhanced by an iterative procedure, performing channel estimation and ICI mitigation at each iteration. Theoretical analysis and simulation results for a Rayleigh fading channel show that the proposed algorithm has low computational complexity and good performance in the presence of high normalized Doppler spread.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.923653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04490153.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.923653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial Estimation of Time-Varying Multipath Gains With Intercarrier Interference Mitigation in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490153/","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial Estimation of Time-Varying Multipath Gains With Intercarrier Interference Mitigation in OFDM Systems","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399798","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490153/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial Estimation of Time-Varying Multipath Gains With Intercarrier Interference Mitigation in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-hijazi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081766S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4490153","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4490154,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Kalbasi","affiliation":["ArrayComm Limited Liability Company, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4749378/4490154/4490154-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Kalbasi (S'01\u2013M'05) received the B.A.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2005.","From 1994 to 2000, he was with Foolad Technique Inc., Isfahan, working in the area of industrial automation and control.

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the most popular block transmission technique. Single-carrier (SC) modulation using frequency-domain equalization (FDE) is an attractive alternative approach based on this principle. In this paper, we propose two new receiver structures for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels employing SC (MIMO-SC) modulation and FDE schemes. These receivers have a hybrid structure with frequency-domain feedforward and time-domain feedback filters for intersymbol interference (ISI) and interference cancellation. The proposed schemes are compared with different MIMO systems employing OFDM modulation (MIMO-OFDM) receivers in terms of performance [bit error rate (BER) and throughput] and complexity. Our performance results show the superiority of MIMO-SC approaches relative to MIMO-OFDM in terms of the BER performance for the simulated scenarios. Also, the simulation results show that the proposed hybrid MIMO-SC receivers yield a higher throughput than a MIMO-OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.923655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04490154.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.923655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Frequency-Domain Block MIMO Transmission Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Frequency-Domain Block MIMO Transmission Systems","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391727","htmlLink":"/document/4490154/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Frequency-Domain Block MIMO Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-kalbasi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066072S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4490154","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4490159,"authors":[{"name":"Bharathram Sivasubramanian","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Bharathram","lastName":"Sivasubramanian","id":"37692201600"},{"name":"Harry Leib","affiliation":["McGill University, Montreal, QC, CA"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Leib","id":"37278547800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4490159","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":630},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Fading","Iterative decoding","AWGN","Feedback","Degradation","Channel capacity","Bit error rate","Error correction","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","correlation methods","error correction codes","iterative decoding","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rician fading channel","fountain code","fixed-rate error control coding","Raptor code","iterative decoding","correlated fading channel","memoryless channel","slow-fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","fountain codes (FCs)","iterative decoding","Raptor codes"]},{"kwd":["Channel coding","Fountain codes","Raptor codes","Iterative decoding"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the newly introduced fountain codes for fixed-rate error control coding, with emphasis on Raptor codes.

A global decoding algorithm, incorporating feedback between the component codes of the Raptor code, is introduced. Results show that fixed-rate Raptor codes closely approach the capacity limits of memoryless channels. It is also shown that Raptor codes incur a performance degradation over slow-fading channels relative to memoryless fading.

We present a collaborative uplink transmit beamforming strategy that can be employed at the relay terminals to provide robustness against uncertainties in the channel state information. The proposed beamforming scheme is obtained using the available knowledge about the second-order statistics of the channel and the possibly erroneous channel state information. The beamforming weight vector is derived by minimizing the total transmitted power subject to a constraint that preserves the received signal at the base station for all the channel realizations within a prescribed uncertainty set. We present two beamforming algorithms based on different mathematical descriptions of the uncertainty set. Both algorithms can be applied to line-of-sight (LOS) propagation and flat-fading channels. In the first algorithm, the robust beamforming vector is computed at the base station using the uplink data and fed back to the cooperating relay terminals. This centralized processing scheme allows any additional convex constraint to be easily incorporated into the beamforming strategy. In the second algorithm, the beamforming vector of each terminal is locally computed using the available knowledge about the terminal's channel and a single parameter (Lagrange multiplier) that is broadcast from the base station to all the cooperating terminals. Simulation results are presented, showing the superior performance of our proposed algorithms compared with classical transmit beamforming techniques in both LOS propagation and flat-fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10391719","htmlLink":"/document/4490163/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Uplink Transmit Beamforming With Robustness Against Channel Estimation Errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Uplink Transmit Beamforming With Robustness Against Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-elkeyi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095357S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4490163","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4490166,"authors":[{"name":"Yabo Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4749378/4490166/4490166-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yabo Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Delaware, Newark, in December 2005.","From July 2001 to July 2002, he was a member of technical staff-1 with Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, Beijing, China.

By realizing that the processing in the frequency domain is insensitive to the errors in the time domain, Mei and Shin recently applied the space-time-coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to achieve full cooperative diversity for asynchronous cooperative communications, where orthogonal space-time block codes (particularly the Alamouti code) were used for relay nodes. In this paper, we consider asynchronous cooperative communications, and the channels from one node to another node are frequency-selective fading. We propose a high-rate space-frequency coding method and prove that it can achieve both cooperative and multipath diversities.

The approach is quite general and applicable to many other systems. Unlike the MB-OFDM system, the enhancement that we propose uses pulses with duty cycles of less than 1 as the amplitude shaping pulse of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. Pulsating OFDM symbols spread the spectrum of the modulated signals in the frequency domain, leading to a spreading gain that is equal to the inverse of the duty cycle of the pulsed subcarriers. We study the spectral characteristics of pulsed OFDM and the added degrees of diversity that it provides. We show that pulsed-OFDM signals can easily be generated by either upsampling an equivalent OFDM baseband signal with a reduced number of carriers or by replacing the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) of a normal MB-OFDM transmitter with a low-duty-cycle DAC. We establish that a pulsed-OFDM receiver can fully exploit the added diversity without using Rake receivers. It is shown that, while pulsed OFDM has superior or comparable performance to MB-OFDM in multipath fading channels, it also has intrinsic low-complexity and power consumption advantages compared with MB-OFDM. To establish this fact, we describe an example design for the IEEE 802.15.3a Standard and present full simulation results for the UWB indoor propagation channels provided by the IEEE 802.15.3a Standard activity committee.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.923680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4783256/04490167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.923680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783256","startPage":"720","endPage":"726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pulsed-OFDM Modulation for Ultrawideband Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pulsed-OFDM Modulation for Ultrawideband Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475158","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4490167/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulsed-OFDM Modulation for Ultrawideband Communications","sourcePdf":"58tvt02-saberinia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046001S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4783256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4783256","articleId":"4490167","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4490168,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4749378/4490168/4490168-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Wu received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering and the M.Eng. degree in computer engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Communications, Beijing, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Software Engineer with Google Inc., Mountain View, CA.

The various network architectures proposed for this purpose have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other systems. However, only a limited amount of work has been completed to understand the fundamental network properties of such systems. In this paper, we present analytical models to study the spatial propagation of information in a highly mobile v2v ad hoc network. We explore both one- and two-way vehicle traffic scenarios. These models can help better understand data dissemination in this environment. Our results show that information propagation depends on some vehicle traffic characteristics, e.g., vehicle density, average vehicle speed, and relative vehicle movement. These models lead to some interesting discoveries, e.g., a message can propagate in the opposite direction as the vehicle traffic flow and can propagate much faster than vehicle movement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04490168.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.923689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.923689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Propagation of Information in Vehicular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Mobile communication","Ad hoc networks","Intelligent transportation systems","Intelligent networks","Intelligent sensors","Buildings","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobile radio","road traffic","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile v2v ad hoc network","spatial propagation","vehicular networks","information infrastructure","mobile vehicles","surface transportation systems","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","data dissemination","vehicle traffic flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc network","intelligent transportation systems (ITSs)","renewal reward process","vehicle to vehicle (v2v)"]},{"kwd":["Ad hoc network","ITS","renewal reward process","v2v"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Propagation of Information in Vehicular Networks","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4490168/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391740","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Propagation of Information in Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106195S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4490168","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4490169,"authors":[{"name":"Zhemin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4749378/4490169/4490169-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhemin Xu (S'05) received the B.Eng. degree in information science and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1998 and the M.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2001.

In particular, we will derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability and an upper bound for the ergodic (average) capacity. These quantities will be expressed using an infinite series representation. To do so, we will first derive the joint cumulative distribution function and the joint probability density function of the squared row norms of the channel matrix. This is enabled by taking advantage of the statistical properties of multivariate chi-squared random variables. Using the outage expression derived, we demonstrate that the considered antenna selection system achieves a full diversity order that is similar to a MIMO system without antenna selection. Next, we derive the probability density function of the maximum of the squared row norms of the channel matrix and its moments, which is straightly related to the system ergodic capacity. We also analyze the error rate performance of the aforementioned receive antenna selection MIMO system while using orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) at the transmitter.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that detects internal attacks by using both message and route redundancy during route discovery. The route-discovery messages are protected by pairwise secret keys between a source and destination and some intermediate nodes along a route established by using public key cryptographic mechanisms. We also propose an optimal routing algorithm with routing metric combining both requirements on a node's trustworthiness and performance. A node builds up the trustworthiness on its neighboring nodes based on its observations on the behaviors of the neighbor nodes. Both of the proposed algorithms can be integrated into existing routing protocols for MANETs, such as ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing (AODV) and dynamic source routing (DSR). As an example, we present such an integrated protocol called secure routing against collusion (SRAC), in which a node makes a routing decision based on its trust of its neighboring nodes and the performance provided by them. The simulation results have demonstrated the significant advantages of the proposed attack detection and routing algorithm over some known protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10399805","htmlLink":"/document/4490171/","displayDocTitle":"A Secure Routing Protocol Against Byzantine Attacks for <emphasis emphasistype=\"roman\">MANETs</emphasis> in Adversarial Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure Routing Protocol Against Byzantine Attacks for <emphasis emphasistype=\"roman\">MANETs</emphasis> in Adversarial Environments","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-myu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124215S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4490171","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4490176,"authors":[{"name":"Xueyan Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4497912/4490176/4490176-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xueyan Tang received the BEng degree in computer science and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1998 and the PhD degree in computer science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in 2003.

Due to resource constraints, the sensor nodes may not have enough energy to report every reading to the base station over a required network lifetime. This paper investigates data collection strategies in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks. Our objective is to maximize the accuracy of data collected by the base station over the network lifetime. Instead of sending sensor readings periodically, the relative importance of the readings is considered in data collection: the sensor nodes send data updates to the base station when the new readings differ more substantially from the previous ones. We analyze the optimal update strategy and develop adaptive update strategies for both individual and aggregate data collections. We also present two methods to cope with message losses in wireless transmission. To make full use of the energy budgets, we design an algorithm to allocate the numbers of updates allowed to be sent by the sensor nodes based on their topological relations. Experimental results using real data traces show that, compared with the periodic strategy, adaptive strategies significantly improve the accuracy of data collected by the base station.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490176/","volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4490176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9995927","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Data Collection Strategies for Lifetime-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Data Collection Strategies for Lifetime-Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2008060721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07374S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4497912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4497912","articleId":"4490176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4490200,"authors":[{"name":"Ciprian Chelba","affiliation":["Deptt. of Management Studies, Sharda University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"bio":{"p":["Ciprian Chelba received his Diploma Engineer degree in 1993 from the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications at \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University, Bucuresti, Romania, the M.S in 1996 and Ph.D. in 2000 from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Johns Hopkins University.

Consequently, information search and retrieval has emerged as a key application area. Text-based search is the most active area, with applications that range from Web and local network search to searching for personal information residing on one's own hard-drive. Speech search has received less attention perhaps because large collections of spoken material have previously not been available. However, with cheaper storage and increased broadband access, there has been a subsequent increase in the availability of online spoken audio content such as news broadcasts, podcasts, and academic lectures. A variety of personal and commercial uses also exist. As data availability increases, the lack of adequate technology for processing spoken documents becomes the limiting factor to large-scale access to spoken content. In this article, we strive to discuss the technical issues involved in the development of information retrieval systems for spoken audio documents, concentrating on the issue of handling the errorful or incomplete output provided by ASR systems. We focus on the usage case where a user enters search terms into a search engine and is returned a collection of spoken document hits.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2008.917992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/4490183/04490200.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.917992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrieval and browsing of spoken content","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Retrieval and browsing of spoken content","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"25","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490200/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9919930","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrieval and browsing of spoken content","sourcePdf":"17-25msp03-chelba.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08202S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"4490183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4490183","articleId":"4490200","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":4490202,"authors":[{"name":"Mari Ostendorf","affiliation":["University of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"bio":{"p":["Mari Ostendorf (mo@ee.washington.edu) has been a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Washington since 1999.

The chip is a first experimental prototype of reduced size to validate the implemented circuits and system level techniques. The convolution processing is based on the address-event-representation (AER) technique, which is a spike-based biologically inspired image and video representation technique that favors communication bandwidth for pixels with more information. As a first test prototype, a pixel array of 16times16 has been implemented with programmable kernel size of up to 16times16. The chip has been fabricated in a standard 0.35 mum complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. The technique also allows to process larger size images by assembling 2D arrays of such chips. Pixel operation exploits low-power mixed analog-digital circuit techniques. Because of the low currents involved (down to \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nanoamperes</i>\n or even \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">picoamperes</i>\n), an important amount of pixel area is devoted to mismatch calibration. The rest of the chip uses digital circuit techniques, both synchronous and asynchronous. The fabricated chip has been thoroughly tested, both at the pixel level and at the system level. Specific computer interfaces have been developed for generating AER streams from conventional computers and feeding them as inputs to the convolution chip, and for grabbing AER streams coming out of the convolution chip and storing and analyzing them on computers. Extensive experimental results are provided. At the end of this paper, we provide discussions and results on scaling up the approach for larger pixel arrays and multilayer cortical AER systems.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2000163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4558069/04490276.pdf","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2000163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4558069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Real-Time AER 2-D Convolutions Hardware for Neuromorphic Spike-Based Cortical Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490276/","displayDocTitle":"On Real-Time AER 2-D Convolutions Hardware for Neuromorphic Spike-Based Cortical Processing","volume":"19","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10160397","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Real-Time AER 2-D Convolutions Hardware for Neuromorphic Spike-Based Cortical Processing","sourcePdf":"19tnn00-linaresbarranco.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151962S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"4558069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"54","articleId":"4490276","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4490277,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Stoica","id":"37277401700"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843500"},{"name":"Xumin Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xumin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536985800"},{"name":"Joseph R.

In this note, we describe a computationally simple and fully automatic method for combining this prior guess with secondary data to obtain a theoretically optimal (in the mean-squared error sense) estimate of the clutter covariance matrix.

This paper examines the question of whether the packet loss pattern, and in particular, the burst length, is important for accurately estimating the expected mean-squared error distortion resulting from packet loss of compressed video. We focus on the challenging case of low-bit-rate video where each P-frame typically fits within a single packet. Specifically, we: 1) verify that the loss pattern does have a significant effect on the resulting distortion; 2) explain why a loss pattern, for example a burst loss, generally produces a larger distortion than an equal number of isolated losses; and 3) propose a model that accurately estimates the expected distortion by explicitly accounting for the loss pattern, inter-frame error propagation, and the correlation between error frames. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated with H.264/AVC coded video and previous frame concealment, where for most sequences the total distortion is predicted to within plusmn0.3 dB for burst loss of length two packets, as compared to prior models which underestimate the distortion by about 1.5 dB. Furthermore, as the burst length increases, our prediction is within plusmn0.7 dB, while prior models degrade and underestimate the distortion by over 3 dB. The proposed model works well for video-telephony-type of sequences with low to medium motion. We also present a simple illustrative example, of how knowledge of the effect of burst loss can be used to adapt the schedule of video streaming to provide improved performance for a burst loss channel, without requiring an increase in bit rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","volume":"18","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10073281","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490280/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Packet Loss for Compressed Video: Effect of Burst Losses and Correlation Between Error Frames","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Packet Loss for Compressed Video: Effect of Burst Losses and Correlation Between Error Frames","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt07-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089872S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4550594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4550594","articleId":"4490280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4490281,"authors":[{"name":"Cesare Alippi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4563499/4490281/4490281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cesare Alippi (SM'94\u2013F'05) received the Dr.Ing. degree in electronic engineering (summa cum laude) and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1990 and 1995, respectively.","He has completed research work in computer sciences at the University College, London, U.K., and the Massachussets Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

Although the transient noise simulation (TNS) supported by a commercial simulator takes into account nonlinear time-varying characteristics of the circuit, its simulation time is unacceptably long to obtain meaningful noise estimation results. Since the single-slope analog-to-digital converter with correlated double sampling (CDS/SS-ADC) in a CMOS image sensor (CIS) is composed of several operation phases in which the circuit topologies are different from each other, the noise cannot be estimated by the conventional FNS. This paper presents a noise estimation method for the CDS/SS-ADC that uses the FNS results while the transient noise behavior is taken into account. The proposed method provides noise estimation results closer to that of the TNS than the conventional FNS, whereas the simulation time is about the same as that of the FNS.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.923434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04490283.pdf","startPage":"2980","endPage":"2987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.923434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Analysis and Simulation Method for a Single-Slope ADC With CDS in a CMOS Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Noise Analysis and Simulation Method for a Single-Slope ADC With CDS in a CMOS Image Sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490283/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10346629","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490283/","volume":"55","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Analysis and Simulation Method for a Single-Slope ADC With CDS in a CMOS Image Sensor","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-cheon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077227S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4490283","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4490284,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hwui Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hwui","lastName":"Chung","id":"37405614900"},{"name":"See-May Phoong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"See-May","lastName":"Phoong","id":"37266374400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"4490284","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Block codes","Fading","Intersymbol interference","MIMO","Error correction","Error correction codes","Quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","error statistics","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","precoding","quadrature phase shift keying","space-time codes","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unitary precoding","space-time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ST-OFDM system","Alamouti space-time block codes","linear time invariant channel","linear time-varying channel","QPSK modulation","inter-carrier interference","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time block coding","equalization","precoding","OFDM"]},{"kwd":["Space-time block coding","equalization","precoding","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies unitary precoders for space-time coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ST-OFDM) systems using Alamouti space-time block codes (STBC).

It is well known that the learning speed of any adaptive filtering algorithm is increased by adding a constraint to it. In this paper, a constrained least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, which incorporates the knowledge of the number of users, spreading sequence length, and additive noise variance, is developed subject to the new combined constraint comprising the MAI and noise variance for a synchronous downlink direct-sequence CDMA system. The novelty of this constraint resides in the fact that the MAI variance was never used as a constraint. In our approach, a Robbins-Monro algorithm is used to minimize the conventional mean-square-error criterion subject to the variance of the new constraint (MAI plus noise). This constrained optimization technique results in an (MAI plus noise)-constrained LMS (MNCLMS) algorithm. The MNCLMS algorithm is a type of variable step-size LMS algorithm where the step-size rule arises naturally from the constraints on MAI and noise variance. Convergence and tracking analysis of the proposed algorithm are carried out in the presence of MAI. Finally, a number of simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the MNCLMS algorithm with other adaptive algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4663192/04490295.pdf","startPage":"2870","endPage":"2883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.923166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.923166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663192","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Access Interference Plus Noise-Constrained Least Mean Square (MNCLMS) Algorithm for CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiple access interference","Multiaccess communication","Least squares approximation","Interference constraints","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Adaptive filters","Filtering algorithms","Downlink","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","code division multiple access","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-access interference","noise-constrained least mean square","CDMA systems","multiuser code-division multiple-access","Gaussian noise","adaptive filtering algorithm","spreading sequence length","additive noise variance","Robbins-Monro algorithm","tracking analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constrained optimization","direct sequence\u2013code-division multiple access (DS\u2013CDMA)","least mean square (MAI plus noise)-constrained least mean square (LMSMNCLMS) algorithm","multiple-access interference (MAI)"]},{"kwd":["DS-CDMA","MAI","Constrained optimization","MNCLMS algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Access Interference Plus Noise-Constrained Least Mean Square (MNCLMS) Algorithm for CDMA Systems","volume":"55","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10347988","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Access Interference Plus Noise-Constrained Least Mean Square (MNCLMS) Algorithm for CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"55tcsi09-moinuddin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102704S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","isNumber":"4663192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4490295","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4490296,"authors":[{"name":"Taisuke Nishio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4663192/4490296/4490296-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taisuke Nishio received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.","In 2007, he joined Canon Inc., Japan, where he is currently working.

It has been recently established by means of a linear model that the manifested nonlinearities due to the supply noise are the fundamental noise frequency component and second-order intermodulation components, qualified by the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and intermodulation distortion (IMD), respectively. In this paper, multidimensional Fourier series analysis is applied to open-loop, single-, and double-feedback pulsewidth modulation CDAs, and expressions for PSRR, IMD, and fold-back distortion (FBD) are derived. This analysis takes into account the nonlinear pulse modulation process (unaccounted for in the linear model), and all components of PSRR and IMD nonlinearities are hence modeled. It is shown that the first-harmonic PSRR and third-order IMD components, which are usually ignored in CDAs and linear amplifiers, are significant and that, under certain conditions, the third-order IMD components can be higher than the second-order IMD components. It is also shown that the loop gain should be high for high PSRR and low IMD. Furthermore, significant FBD can arise due to the intermodulation between the supply noise, the input signal, and the carrier, and interestingly, the FBD in closed-loop CDAs is more serious than that in open-loop CDAs. The analyses herein are verified by computer simulations and on the basis of measurements on a prototype CDA IC and on other hardware realizations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Power amplifiers","Signal to noise ratio","Pulse modulation","Frequency","Intermodulation distortion","Multidimensional systems","Fourier series","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulsed power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","Fourier series","intermodulation distortion","power supply circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply noise","analog audio amplifiers","class D amplifiers","multidimensional Fourier series analysis","power supply rejection ratio","intermodulation distortion","fold-back distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class D amplifiers (CDAs)","intermodulation distortion (IMD) pub"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.921055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4774051/04490299.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.921055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Supply Noise in Analog Audio Class D Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Supply Noise in Analog Audio Class D Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490299/","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490299/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10470349","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Supply Noise in Analog Audio Class D Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"56tcsi01-shu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087269S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4774051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4774051","articleId":"4490299","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4490308,"authors":[{"name":"Luc\u00cda Costas-Perez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4531695/4490308/4490308-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luc\u00eda Costas-P\u00e9rez received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in physics (major in electronics) from the University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain, in 1996 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2006.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electronic Technology, University of Vigo.

The use of the laboratory has been optimized by the availability of a remote access infrastructure that allows the definition and booking of time slots related to the laboratory sites. Given the many kinds of existing sensors, conditioning circuits, and actuators, setting up an educational framework is a complex (and expensive) task, even if only the main design alternatives are taken into account. An additional and fundamental issue to be considered for the optimization of any educational resource or teaching/learning methodology is the possibility to adapt it to the capabilities of different profiles, i.e., students enrolled in different courses. The proposed solution has been designed to be used by both nonexperienced students, who act as plain users testing predefined experiments, and advanced ones, who can demonstrate the design skills they have learnt, by developing their own applications and conditioning circuits. Accordingly, the remote access infrastructure allows different kinds of users to be defined, whose capabilities, restrictions, and software requirements depend on their level of knowledge.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10006643","htmlLink":"/document/4490308/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of an Industrial Sensor and Data Acquisition Laboratory Through Time Sharing and Remote Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of an Industrial Sensor and Data Acquisition Laboratory Through Time Sharing and Remote Access","sourcePdf":"55tie06-costasperez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10236S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4531695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4531695","articleId":"4490308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4490310,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Jin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4531695/4490310/4490310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woo-Jin Lee (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2006.

The proposed converter employs a voltage-doubler rectifier without an output inductor. Since it does not have an output inductor, the voltage stresses of the rectifier diodes can be clamped at the output voltage level. Thus, since no dissipative resistor-capacitor snubber for rectifier diodes is needed, high-efficiency low-noise output voltage can be realized. Due to the elimination of the large output inductor, it features simpler structure, lower cost, smaller mass, and lighter weight. Furthermore, the proposed converter has wide zero-voltage-switching ranges of lagging leg switches with low current stresses of the primary power switches by using the magnetizing current. In addition, the resonance between the leakage inductor of the transformer and the rectifier capacitors can reduce the current stresses of the rectifier diodes and conduction losses. In this paper, the operational principles, analysis, design considerations, and experimental results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","accessionNumber":"10006653","htmlLink":"/document/4490310/","displayDocTitle":"A New Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge Converter With Voltage-Doubler-Type Rectifier for High-Efficiency PDP Sustaining Power Module","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge Converter With Voltage-Doubler-Type Rectifier for High-Efficiency PDP Sustaining Power Module","sourcePdf":"55tie06-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111617S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4531695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4531695","articleId":"4490310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4490312,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Neil Braithwaite","affiliation":["Powerwave Technologies, Inc., Santa Ana, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4684845/4490312/4490312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Richard Neil Braithwaite (M'05) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, Canada, in 1985 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of British Columbia, Canada, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.","From 1992 to 1995, he conducted postdoctoral work at the University of California, Riverside.

A frequency-selective nonlinear positive feedback loop embedded within the FFPA generates a pilot tone and IF detection measures the residual pilot power after the second loop cancellation. The proposed system differs from other pilot approaches because the self-oscillating feedback structure uses the gain of the main amplifier and the cancellation of the second feedforward loop to generate the pilot. The latter causes the amplitude of the generated pilot to drop abruptly (turn off automatically) when the second loop alignment converges, eliminating spurs in the output spectrum associated with residual pilot feedthrough. Self-oscillation allows the power-based detection to, optionally, be extended into synchronous detection by measuring the frequency of the generated pilot. A theoretical analysis of the positive feedback pilot circuit is developed and verified using experimental results. Contours obtained from two-dimensional sweeps of the available alignment settings verify that the pilot system measurements are suitable for descent-based search algorithms using either the power or synchronous detection modes. Improved convergence is achieved using a proposed algorithm based on synchronous detection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback loop","Control systems","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Power measurement","Frequency measurement","Distributed power generation","Synchronous generators","Feedback circuits","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","feedforward amplifiers","power amplifiers","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["positive feedback pilot system","self-oscillation","second loop control","feedforward power amplifier","pilot tone","IF detection","search algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedforward amplifiers","feedforward systems","power amplifier linearization","power amplifiers"]},{"kwd":["Power amplifiers","feedforward amplifiers","feedforward systems","power amplifier linearization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.923272","startPage":"3293","endPage":"3305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04490312.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.923272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Positive Feedback Pilot System for Second Loop Control in a Feedforward Power Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Positive Feedback Pilot System for Second Loop Control in a Feedforward Power Amplifier","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10346633","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","volume":"55","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4490312/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Positive Feedback Pilot System for Second Loop Control in a Feedforward Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-braithwaite.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072038S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4490312","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4490315,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Dastgheib","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4684845/4490315/4490315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Dastgheib (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2007.

Classical methods for accuracy evaluation are based on fixed-point simulations but they lead to very long optimization times.A new method based on an analytical approach is presented for the case of linear-time-invariant (LTI) systems. The use of this method in data word-length minimization processes reduces significantly the optimization time compared to simulation based methods. Our approach allows the automatic determination of the signal-to-quantization-noise-ratio (SQNR) expression at the system output according to the fixed-point data format. This method is valid for recursive and non-recursive LTI systems and takes account of the quantization modes (truncation or rounding). The theoretical concepts and the different methodology stages are explained.

The developed algebraic soft-decision decoding (ASD) algorithms of RS codes can achieve substantial coding gain with polynomial complexity. Among the ASD algorithms with practical multiplicity assignment schemes, the bit-level generalized minimum distance (BGMD) decoding algorithm can achieve similar or higher coding gain with lower complexity. ASD algorithms consist of two major steps: the interpolation and the factorization. In this paper, novel architectures for both steps are proposed for the BGMD decoder. The interpolation architecture is based on the newly proposed Lee-O'Sullivan (LO) algorithm. By exploiting the characteristics of the LO algorithm and the multiplicity assignment scheme in the BGMD decoder, the proposed interpolation architecture for a (255, 239) RS code can achieve 25% higher efficiency in terms of speed/area ratio than prior efforts. Root computation over finite fields and polynomial updating are the two main steps of the factorization. A low-latency and prediction-free scheme is introduced in this paper for the root computation in the BGMD decoder. In addition, novel coefficient storage schemes and parallel processing architectures are developed to reduce the latency of the polynomial updating. The proposed factorization architecture is 126% more efficient than the previous direct root computation factorization architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI Architecture for Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.923169","startPage":"3050","endPage":"3062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.923169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04490318.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4490318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4490318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI Architecture for Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4490318/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10346637","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI Architecture for Soft-Decision Decoding of Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090286S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4490318","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4490319,"authors":[{"name":"Wonseok Oh","affiliation":["RF Micro Devices, Inc., Chandler, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4684845/4490319/4490319-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wonseok Oh (S'05-M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from University of Incheon, Incheon, Korea in 1997, and 1999, respectively and Ph.D. degree from Arizona State University in 2006.

Traditionally, however, either only one of the objectives is adopted as the cost function or multiple objectives are aggregated to a scalar cost function. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that most conventional learning algorithms can only deal with a scalar cost function. Over the last decade, efforts on solving machine learning problems using the Pareto-based multiobjective optimization methodology have gained increasing impetus, particularly due to the great success of multiobjective optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other population-based stochastic search methods. It has been shown that Pareto-based multiobjective learning approaches are more powerful compared to learning algorithms with a scalar cost function in addressing various topics of machine learning, such as clustering, feature selection, improvement of generalization ability, knowledge extraction, and ensemble generation. One common benefit of the different multiobjective learning approaches is that a deeper insight into the learning problem can be gained by analyzing the Pareto front composed of multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. This paper provides an overview of the existing research on multiobjective machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. In addition, a number of case studies are provided to illustrate the major benefits of the Pareto-based approach to machine learning, e.g., how to identify interpretable models and models that can generalize on unseen data from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions. Three approaches to Pareto-based multiobjective ensemble generation are compared and discussed in detail. Finally, potentially interesting topics in multiobjective machine learning are suggested.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2008.919172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4492353/04492360.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2008.919172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pareto-Based Multiobjective Machine Learning: An Overview and Case Studies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Pareto-Based Multiobjective Machine Learning: An Overview and Case Studies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492360/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9921439","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492360/","volume":"38","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto-Based Multiobjective Machine Learning: An Overview and Case Studies","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc03-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131135S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4492353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"191","xplore-issue":"4492353","articleId":"4492360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4492366,"authors":[{"name":"David Blythe","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4490117/4492366/4492366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Blythe (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 1983 and 1985, respectively.","He is a Software Architect with the Desktop and Graphics Technology Group, Windows Product Division, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA.

These new applications constrain architecture developers to embed dedicated hardware accelerators in order to meet the application timing requirements. However the use of dedicated monolithic hardware accelerators is onerous to achieve due to physical and economical constraints. When the multimedia applications share common functionalities, monolithic hardware accelerators could be split into smaller accelerators in order to cut down redundancy in hardware implemented functionalities and save silicon area. Nevertheless lowering the granularity of accelerator will increase synchronization calls between the main processor and the accelerators.

We show that hardware accelerator granularity has a direct effect on the system performance in terms of cache misses, execution time and thus energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9940778","htmlLink":"/document/4492413/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interrupt Costs in Embedded System with Short Latency Hardware Accelerators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interrupt Costs in Embedded System with Short Latency Hardware Accelerators","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"3141a317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034936S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492367","isNumber":"4492368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492367","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4492368","articleId":"4492413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4492418,"authors":[{"name":"Gaye Lightbody","affiliation":["University of Ulster, Antrim, UK"],"firstName":"Gaye","lastName":"Lightbody","id":"37089146253"},{"name":"Roger Woods","affiliation":["Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Woods","id":"37271861100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3141-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3141-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4492418","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Productivity","Arithmetic","Design methodology","Resonance light scattering","Silicon","System-level design","Software libraries","Discrete cosine transforms","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","industrial property","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QR recursive least squares","IP core","design methodology","adaptive filter","intellectual property","design for reuse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IP cores","design for reuse","RLS filter implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492418","doi":"10.1109/ECBS.2008.54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECBS.2008.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492368","publicationTitle":"15th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshop on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems (ecbs 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"15th Annual IEEE International Conference and Workshop on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems (ecbs 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492367/4492368/04492418.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QR Recursive Least Squares IP Core Example","abstract":"With transistor counts increasing at a rate of 58% per year and design productivity only growing at 21% per year, there is an important need to develop new design approaches to close this gap.

The method is implemented on TinyOS operating system. A collection tree network is formed and multi-hoping data is sent to the base station root. Nodes take environmental measurements every N seconds while neighboring nodes overhear the measurement as it is being forwarded to the base station and record it. After nodes complete M and receive/store M measurements from each neighboring node, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to model the sensor node, the node's dynamics, and interconnections with neighboring nodes. The physical measurement is compared against the predicted value and a given threshold of error to determine sensor fault. By simply overhearing network traffic, this implementation uses no extra bandwidth or radio broadcast power. The only cost of the approach is battery power required to power the receiver to overhear packets and MCU processor time to train the RNN.","doi":"10.1109/ITNG.2008.187","startPage":"378","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2008.187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492438","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492437/4492438/04492509.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Implementation of Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492509/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Implementation of Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492509/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9939510","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Implementation of Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"3099a378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036963S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492437","isNumber":"4492438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492437","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4492438","articleId":"4492509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4492560,"authors":[{"name":"Taner Dincer","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Mugla University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Taner","lastName":"Dincer","id":"38125148400"},{"name":"Bahar Karaoglan","affiliation":["International Computer Institute, Ege University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bahar","lastName":"Karaoglan","id":"38132565900"},{"name":"Tarik Kisla","affiliation":["International Computer Institute, Ege University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Kisla","id":"38132566700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3099-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3099-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4492560","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vocabulary","Tagging","Hidden Markov models","Natural languages","Information retrieval","Speech","Information technology","Statistics","Stochastic processes","Indexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","information retrieval","natural languages","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suffix based stochastic part-of-speech tagger","Turkish language","information retrieval","hidden Markov model","vocabulary"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Part-Of-Speech Tagging","Closed vocabulary","Agglutinative languages","Information Retrieval."]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a stochastic part-of-speech tagger for Turkish.

The capacity of this system is difficult to manually compute because of at least two reasons. Firstly, this system is designed to support many types of services, and hence capacity calculation using classic Erlang's capacity is not sufficient. Secondly, the capacity of such system depends on interference which is a time-varying factor, so that it is necessary to precisely model the interference; otherwise the result may be inaccurate. This paper aims to provide complete details of uplink WCDMA modeling and simulation. This proposed simulation is a dynamic system-level simulation in which important parameters such as radio propagation effects, user movement, power control and interference modeling are included. The principles of WCDMA modeling and simulation which are presented in this paper are essential tools for study and research in optimising UMTS system.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492437/4492438/04492627.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1076","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)","doi":"10.1109/ITNG.2008.165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2008.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-Level Modeling and Simulation of Uplink WCDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Topology","Interference","3G mobile communication","Power system modeling","Traffic control","Radio propagation","Power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","interference (signal)","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-level modeling","uplink WCDMA","Universal Mobile Telecommunication System","system interference","dynamic system-level simulation","radio propagation effect","user movement","power control","interference modeling","UMTS system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA","UMTS","3G","Simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"System-Level Modeling and Simulation of Uplink WCDMA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9926113","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-Level Modeling and Simulation of Uplink WCDMA","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"3099b071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040136S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492437","isNumber":"4492438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492437","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4492438","articleId":"4492627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4492630,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Ho Bahn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun Ho","lastName":"Bahn","id":"37296624400"},{"name":"Jungsook Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jungsook","lastName":"Yang","id":"37858425000"},{"name":"Nader Bagherzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Bagherzadeh","id":"37267183200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3099-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3099-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4492630","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":451},"abstract":"This paper presents several parallel FFT algorithms with different degree of communication overhead for multiprocessors in network-on-chip (NoC) environment. Three different methods of parallel FFT are presented. One is the reference parallel FFT for comparison, and the other two with well-distributed computation as well as reduced communication overhead. By evenly distributing parallel computation tasks which uses data locality, the execution time for completing each stage of FFT can be reduced. Moreover, by optimizing data exchanges we minimize the communication overhead. Depending on the communication regularity, one can select appropriate parallel FFT algorithm. By using the simulation results of our cycle-accurate SystemC NoC model with a parameterizable 2-D mesh architecture, and the performance analysis in time as well as complexity, our proposed algorithms are shown to outperform other parallel FFT algorithm or high-speed DSP implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492437/4492438/04492630.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1093","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Information Technology: New Generations (itng 2008)","doi":"10.1109/ITNG.2008.55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITNG.2008.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel FFT Algorithms on Network-on-Chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Signal processing algorithms","Concurrent computing","Discrete Fourier transforms","Distributed computing","Digital signal processing","Parallel processing","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip","parallel FFT algorithm","data exchange optimization","fast Fourier transform","2D mesh architecture","communication overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","Parallel Programming","Network-on-Chip (NoC)","Embedded DSP system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Parallel FFT Algorithms on Network-on-Chips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9939559","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel FFT Algorithms on Network-on-Chips","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"3099b087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06202S","chronDate":"7-9 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492437","isNumber":"4492438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492437","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4492438","articleId":"4492630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4492680,"authors":[{"name":"Syed S.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight fault-tolerant mechanism for NoCs based on default backup paths (DBPs) designed to maintain, in the presence of failures, network connectivity of both non-faulty routers as well as healthy processor cores which may be connected to faulty routers. The mechanism provides default paths as backup between certain router ports which serve as alternative datapaths to circumvent failed components within a faulty router. Along with a minimal subset of normal network channels, the set of default backup paths internal to faulty routers form - in the worst case - a unidirectional ring topology that provides network-wide connectivity to all processor cores. Routing using the DBP mechanism is proved to be deadlock-free with only two virtual channels even for fault scenarios in which regular networks degrade to irregular (arbitrary) topologies.

To do this we have written a scheduler to map benchmarks to the wire sharing architecture. The algorithm developed allows us to trade off between wire count and latency. This is the first time that the statically configured FPGA wiring has been entirely replaced by time-multiplexed wiring.

Although some area of the FPGA then has a fixed function, this loss of flexibility is outweighed by the following benefits. First, implementation cost is much reduced. Second, a hardwired NOC solves physical problems such as timing closure and high cost of global wiring. Third, dynamic partial reconfiguration can be better exploited. Compared to current soft or firm interconnects, a hardwired NOC poses fewer restrictions on the (re)placement of IP blocks in the FPGA. Finally, we also propose that the hardwired NOC is used for both the functional interconnect between the IP blocks and the configuration interconnect that transports the bitstreams. We give a detailed overview of our NOC architecture, and its configuration and programming. The proposed scheme enhances the on-line generation of bit- streams and the on-line verification of loaded bitstreams to detect tampering with the device. In our experiment, a hardwired NOC has acceptable (< 10%) overhead for IP sizes with approximately 1400 lookup tables (LUT), enabling a fine-grained combined functional and configuration interconnect. A hardwired NOC offers significantly better functional performance than a soft NOC. Moreover, the configuration and programming of the hard NoC is much faster than when using a soft NOC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9940704","htmlLink":"/document/4492724/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"rdwired Networks on Chip in FPGAs to Unify Functional and Configuration Interconnects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"rdwired Networks on Chip in FPGAs to Unify Functional and Configuration Interconnects","confLoc":"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"3098a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056104S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492707","isNumber":"4492708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492707","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4492708","articleId":"4492724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4492725,"authors":[{"name":"Mikkel Bystrup Stensgaard","affiliation":["Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Mikkel Bystrup","lastName":"Stensgaard","id":"38054495800"},{"name":"Jens Spars\u00f8","affiliation":["Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Spars\u00f8","id":"37265824500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3098-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3098-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4492725","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Network topology","Circuit topology","Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","System-on-a-chip","Energy efficiency","Switching circuits","Energy consumption","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip architecture","reconfigurable topology","system-on-chip","IP-blocks","NoC routers","energy-efficient topology switches","physical circuit-switching","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip","Reconfigurable","Communication","Application-specific","System-on-Chip"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a network-on-chip (NoC) architecture that enables the network topology to be reconfigured.

In this paper, we describe the implementation of an architecture- level early-stage design space exploration tool that incorporates the effect of process and temperature variation for network-on-chips(NoC). The tool is used to study the impact of process and temperature variations on power and energy-delay-product-per-flit metrics for different NoC architectures, and our simulation results show that design choices are influenced by the effects of process and temperature variation, thus demonstrating the importance of considering, and enabling the high- level impact analysis of process and temperature variation early in the design flow.","displayPublicationTitle":"Second ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (nocs 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492707/4492708/04492731.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"Second ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (nocs 2008)","doi":"10.1109/NOCS.2008.4492731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOCS.2008.4492731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492708","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Process and Temperature Variations on Network-on-Chip Design Exploration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Network-on-a-chip","USA Councils","System-level design","Space exploration","Tiles","Polarization","CMOS technology","Power measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","logic design","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature variations","process variations","network-on-chip design exploration","energy-delay-product-per-flit metrics","NoC architectures","high-level impact analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Process and Temperature Variations on Network-on-Chip Design Exploration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9940711","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Process and Temperature Variations on Network-on-Chip Design Exploration","confLoc":"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"3098a117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120665S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492707","isNumber":"4492708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492707","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4492708","articleId":"4492731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4492734,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan-Tu Tran","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Xuan-Tu","lastName":"Tran","id":"37667715300"},{"name":"Yvain Thonnart","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Yvain","lastName":"Thonnart","id":"37298712200"},{"name":"Jean Durupt","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINA TEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Durupt","id":"37682141500"},{"name":"Vincent Beroulle","affiliation":["NPG-LCIS, Valence, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Beroulle","id":"37283260900"},{"name":"Chantal Robach","affiliation":["NPG-LCIS, Valence, France"],"firstName":"Chantal","lastName":"Robach","id":"37281873400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3098-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3098-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4492734","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":373},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design for testability","Network-on-a-chip","Test pattern generators","System testing","Computer architecture","Logic testing","Computer networks","Embedded computing","Timing","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","design for testability","fault diagnosis","logic testing","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous network-on-chip architecture","test pattern generation","postfabrication testing","design-for-test architecture","network routers","network topology","single stuck-at fault models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip","NoC","Design-for-Test","DfT","NoC testing","SoC testing","testing methodology","testability","on-chip communication","Globally Asynchronous - Locally Synchronous","GALS","QDI asynchronous logic"]}],"abstract":"Asynchronous design offers an attractive solution to overcome the problems faced by networks-on-chip (NoC) designers such as timing constraints.

Then, a simple method for generating test patterns for network routers is described. Test patterns are automatically generated by a custom program, given the network topology and the network size.

Towards a secure system at each level of design, this paper addresses security aspects related to network-on-chip (NoC) architectures, foreseen as the communication infrastructure of next-generation embedded devices. In the context of NoC-based multiprocessor systems, we focus on the topic, not yet thoroughly faced, of data protection. In this paper, we present a secure NoC architecture composed of a set of data protection units (DPUs) implemented within the network interfaces. The run-time configuration of the programmable part of the DPUs is managed by a central unit, the network security manager (NSM). The DPU, similar to a firewall, can check and limit the access rights (none, read, write, or both) of processors accessing data and instructions in a shared memory - in particular distinguishing between the operating roles (supervisor/user and secure/unsecure) of the processing elements. We explore different alternative implementations for the DPU and demonstrate how this unit does not affect the network latency if the memory request has the appropriate rights. We also focus on the dynamic updating of the DPUs to support their utilization in dynamic environments, and on the utilization of authentication techniques to increase the level of security.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4579700/04492766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4579700","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Memory Accesses on Networks-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Secure Memory Accesses on Networks-on-Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492766/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177175","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4492766/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Memory Accesses on Networks-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"ttc2008091216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042956S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4579700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"61","articleId":"4492766","onlineDate":"10 June 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4492767,"authors":[{"name":"Maleq Khan","affiliation":["Network Dynamics and Simulation Science Laboratory, Virginia Bioinformatics Institute, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4694808/4492767/4492767-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Maleq Khan received the BS degree in computer science and engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, the MS degree in computer science from North Dakota State University, and the PhD degree in computer science from Purdue University.

In such networks, a sensor has very limited power, and any algorithm needs to be simple, local, and energy efficient for being practical. Motivated by these considerations, we design and analyze a class of simple and local distributed algorithms called nearest neighbor tree (NNT) algorithms for energy-efficient construction of MSTs in a wireless ad hoc setting. We assume that the nodes are uniformly distributed in a unit square and show provable bounds on the performance with respect to both the quality of the spanning tree produced and the energy needed to construct them. In particular, we show that NNT produces a close approximation to the MST, and they can be maintained dynamically with polylogarithmic number of rearrangements under node insertions/deletions. We also perform extensive simulations of our algorithms. We tested our algorithms on both uniformly random distributions of nodes, and on a realistic distributions of nodes in an urban setting. Simulations validate the theoretical results and show that the bounds are much better in practice.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2008.57","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4694808/04492767.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2008.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4694808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Minimum Spanning Trees in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492767/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Minimum Spanning Trees in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"20","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10348038","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492767/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Algorithms for Constructing Approximate Minimum Spanning Trees in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2009010124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126267S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4694808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"4694808","articleId":"4492767","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4492769,"authors":[{"name":"Issam Al-Azzoni","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Software, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4670315/4492769/4492769-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Issam Al-Azzoni received the MASc degree in software engineering from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree in software engineering in the Department of Computing and Software.

One of the jobs of an RMS is the mapping of arriving tasks onto the machines of the HC system. Many different mapping heuristics have been proposed in recent years. However, most of these heuristics suffer from several limitations. One of these limitations is the performance degradation that results from using outdated global information about the status of all machines in the HC system. This paper proposes several heuristics which address this limitation by only requiring partial information in making the mapping decisions. These heuristics utilize the solution to a linear programming (LP) problem which maximizes the system capacity. Simulation results show that our heuristics perform very competitively while requiring dramatically less information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492769/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492769/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10312251","volume":"19","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear Programming-Based Affinity Scheduling of Independent Tasks on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Programming-Based Affinity Scheduling of Independent Tasks on Heterogeneous Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"ttd2008121671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129671S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4670315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4670315","articleId":"4492769","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4492779,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang-Liang Hou","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4604642/4492779/4492779-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiang-Liang Hou received the PhD degree in industrial engineering from National Tsing-Hua University (NTHU).

Traditional schemes for explicit knowledge representation within enterprise and academic circles are primarily text-oriented and thus, a great deal of time and effort are required for knowledge receivers to understand the contents, especially for motion knowledge. In order to enhance knowledge reuse with motion knowledge extraction, representation, and visualization, this research focuses on the development of a motion knowledge representation and visualization (MKRV) model for Chinese documents with three modules, namely the automatic thesaurus definition (ATD) module, the target sentence extraction and formatting (TSEF) module, and the motion knowledge visualization (MKV) module. Moreover, based on the proposed model, a Motion Knowledge Representation and Management System (MKRMS) is established. A real world case of computer assembly is also applied in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed model. The verification results show that the system could achieve a high performance level with a small amount of training data.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4604642/04492779.pdf","startPage":"1424","endPage":"1439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4604642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge Reuse Enhancement with Motional Visual Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge Reuse Enhancement with Motional Visual Representation","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10180052","htmlLink":"/document/4492779/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge Reuse Enhancement with Motional Visual Representation","sourcePdf":"ttk2008101424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088735S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4604642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4604642","articleId":"4492779","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4492784,"authors":[{"name":"Ujjwal Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4758536/4492784/4492784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ujjwal Bhattacharya received the MSc and MPhil degrees in pure mathematics from Calcutta University, Kolkata, India, in 1989 and 1991, respectively.

The principal contributions presented here are (a) pioneering development of two databases for handwritten numerals of two most popular Indian scripts, (b) a multistage cascaded recognition scheme using wavelet based multiresolution representations and multilayer perceptron classifiers and (c) application of (b) for the recognition of mixed handwritten numerals of three Indian scripts Devanagari, Bangla and English. The present databases include respectively 22,556 and 23,392 handwritten isolated numeral samples of Devanagari and Bangla collected from real-life situations and these can be made available free of cost to researchers of other academic Institutions. In the proposed scheme, a numeral is subjected to three multilayer perceptron classifiers corresponding to three coarse-to-fine resolution levels in a cascaded manner. If rejection occurred even at the highest resolution, another multilayer perceptron is used as the final attempt to recognize the input numeral by combining the outputs of three classifiers of the previous stages. This scheme has been extended to the situation when the script of a document is not known a priori or the numerals written on a document belong to different scripts. Handwritten numerals in mixed scripts are frequently found in Indian postal mails and table-form documents.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4758536/04492784.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten Numeral Databases of Indian Scripts and Multistage Recognition of Mixed Numerals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Handwriting recognition","Character recognition","Natural languages","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Multilayer perceptrons","Postal services","Computer architecture","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","image recognition","image resolution","multilayer perceptrons","natural language processing","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten numeral databases","Indian scripts","multistage recognition","mixed numerals","isolated handwritten numeral recognition","multistage cascaded recognition scheme","wavelet-based multiresolution representations","multilayer perceptron","Bangla","coarse-to-fine resolution levels","Devanagari"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Handwriting analysis","Optical character recognition"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Automatic Data Processing","Databases, Factual","Handwriting","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","India","Information Storage and Retrieval","Information Storage and Retrieval","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reading","Reference Values"]},{"kwd":["Handwriting analysis","Optical character recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Handwritten Numeral Databases of Indian Scripts and Multistage Recognition of Mixed Numerals","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4492784/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10401611","pubMedId":"19147874","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handwritten Numeral Databases of Indian Scripts and Multistage Recognition of Mixed Numerals","sourcePdf":"ttp2009030444.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211254S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4758536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4758536","articleId":"4492784","onlineDate":"18 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4492788,"authors":[{"name":"Qingxiong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4758536/4492788/4492788-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qingxiong Yang received the BE degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2004 and the MSc degree in computer science from the University of Kentucky in 2007.

To improve via yield and reliability, redundant-via insertion is a highly recommended technique proposed by foundries. Traditionally, double-via insertion is performed at the postlayout stage. The increasing design complexity, however, leaves very limited space for postlayout optimization. It is thus desirable to consider the double-via insertion at both the routing and postrouting stages. In this paper, we present a new full-chip gridless routing system considering double-via insertion for yield enhancement. To fully consider double vias, the router applies a novel two-pass, bottom-up routability-driven routing framework and features a new redundant-via aware detailed maze routing algorithm (which could be applied to both gridless and grid-based routing). We also propose a graph-matching based post-layout double-via insertion algorithm to achieve a higher insertion rate. In particular, the algorithm is optimal for grid-based routing with up to three routing layers and the stacked-via structure. Experiments show that our methods significantly improve the via count, number of dead vias, double-via insertion rates, and running times.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-Chip Routing Considering Double-Via Insertion","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.917597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4492824/04492826.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.917597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492824","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Full-Chip Routing Considering Double-Via Insertion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4492826/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-Chip Routing Considering Double-Via Insertion","sourcePdf":"27tcad05-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141147S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4492824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4492824","articleId":"4492826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4492827,"authors":[{"name":"Song Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4492824/4492827/4492827-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Song Chen received the B.S. degree in computer science from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Visiting Research Associate with the Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan.

The proposed perturbation method can greatly accelerate searching-based algorithms, such as simulated annealing, by skipping many solutions that fail to meet the fixed-outline constraint. Moreover, based on the analysis of the diverse objective functions used in the existing research works, we suggest for the FOFP a new objective function which is still effective when combined with other objectives. Experimental results show that, if area and wirelength are optimized simultaneously, using less time, the proposed method obtains much higher average success rate for the FOFP with various aspect ratios, while the wirelength with the fixed-outline constraint is reduced by 20% on average, compared with the latest fixed-outline floorplanners. On the other hand, we validated once more by experiments that an aspect ratio close to one is beneficial to wirelength, and hence, a larger area weight is necessary for the FOFP with a larger aspect ratio to ensure feasible solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.917968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4492824/04492827.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.917968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-Outline Floorplanning: Block-Position Enumeration and a New Method for Calculating Area Costs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492827/","displayDocTitle":"Fixed-Outline Floorplanning: Block-Position Enumeration and a New Method for Calculating Area Costs","volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921472","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4492827/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-Outline Floorplanning: Block-Position Enumeration and a New Method for Calculating Area Costs","sourcePdf":"27tcad05-chen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119931S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4492824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4492824","articleId":"4492827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4492832,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong-Ho Han","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Ho","lastName":"Han","id":"37653743900"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"4492832","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Adders","Signal processing algorithms","Costs","Hardware","Digital filters","Tree graphs","Digital signal processing","Stability","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","FIR filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filter synthesis","multiple adder graphs","hardware complexity","finite-impulse response digital filters","filter synthesis algorithm","dependence-graph algorithms","Hartley algorithm","eta-dimensional algorithm","adder graph hybrid algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital filter","filter optimization","finite-impulse response (FIR) filter synthesis","multiplier block"]}],"abstract":"To reduce the hardware complexity of finite-impulse response (FIR) digital filters, this paper proposes a new filter synthesis algorithm.

To ensure the desired circuit performance, bounds of layout parasitics are determined first. These bounds are used to constrain the layout geometries while retargeting existing high-quality layouts across technologies and specification sets.

Such direct drives with multiple degrees of freedom are an emerging technology because of their high performance. Previously, we designed planar actuators capable of generating thrusts anywhere in the movement area and successfully demonstrated the two-dimensional drive of the actuator in the translational direction. However, during translational motion control on the plane, a slight oscillatory yaw motion occurred. Thrusts and torques of the actuator are proportional to the - and -axis currents, which generate flux densities with 90 and 0 phase-leads, respectively, from the flux density generated by the permanent magnets of the mover. Therefore, the thrusts and torques can be generated independently by the - and -axis current control. In our new design, we use a decoupling control on the planar actuator to control both yaw and translational motions on the plane. We describe the experimentally obtained drive characteristics of this actuator. The experimental results indicate that the mover can travel over large yaw and translational displacements independently and simultaneously with relatively precise positioning and response. Thus, we have demonstrated satisfactory performance of a planar actuator with three degrees of freedom.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4492849/04492858.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.918289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.918289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4492858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Planar Actuator with a Small Mover Traveling Over Large Yaw and Translational Displacements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Motion control","Coils","DC generators","Permanent magnets","Current control","Displacement control","Stacking","Energy consumption","Production facilities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","electric current control","motion control","permanent magnets","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar actuator","translational displacements","three-degree-of-freedom actuator","translational motion control","slight oscillatory yaw motion","permanent magnets","decoupling control","current control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decoupling control","large displacements","planar actuator","translational motion","yaw motion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4492858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Planar Actuator with a Small Mover Traveling Over Large Yaw and Translational Displacements","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4492858/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921432","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Planar Actuator with a Small Mover Traveling Over Large Yaw and Translational Displacements","sourcePdf":"44tmag05-ueda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084916S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4492849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4492849","articleId":"4492858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4492888,"authors":[{"name":"Leo Freitas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Freitas","id":"37925561500"},{"name":"Jim Woodcock","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Woodcock","id":"37272514700"},{"name":"Andrew Butterfield","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Butterfield","id":"37377131800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3139-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3139-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4492888","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Power system reliability","Computer science","Fault tolerance","Software tools","Mars","Protocols","Flash memory","Computer industry","Software performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","program verification","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["POSIX file store API","formal verification","verified software grand challenge project","storage management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grand Challenge","POSIX","file store","software verification"]}],"abstract":"We present a research roadmap for the second pilot project in the Verified Software Grand Challenge on formally verified POSIX file stores.

Beside being interfaces between the worlds of humans and computers, domain specific APIs contain a considerable amount of domain knowledge. Due to the big abstraction gap between the real world and today's programming languages, in addition to the knowledge about their domain, these APIs are cluttered with a considerable amount of noise in form of implementation detail. Furthermore, an API offers a particular view on its domain and different APIs regard their domains from different perspectives. In this paper we propose an approach for building domain ontologies by identifying commonalities between domain specific APIs that target the same domain. Besides our ontology extraction algorithm, we present a methodology for eliminating the noise and we sketch possible usage-scenarios of the ontologies for program analysis and understanding. We evaluate our approach through a set of case-studies on extracting domain ontologies from well-known domain specific APIs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489834/4493286/04493315.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"2008 12th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","doi":"10.1109/CSMR.2008.4493315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSMR.2008.4493315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493286","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Domain Ontologies from Domain Specific APIs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Computer languages","Libraries","Reverse engineering","Graphical user interfaces","Programming profession","Humans","Computer interfaces","Algorithm design and analysis","Knowledge acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","program diagnostics","reverse engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domain ontology extraction","domain specific API","domain knowledge","program analysis","program understanding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reverse engineering","Libraries","Knowledge acquisition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Domain Ontologies from Domain Specific APIs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493315/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9925949","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","conferenceDate":"1-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Domain Ontologies from Domain Specific APIs","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"CSMR-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067544S","chronDate":"1-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4489834","isNumber":"4493286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489834","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4493286","articleId":"4493315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4493326,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Dhambri","affiliation":["Department I.R.O., Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Dhambri","id":"37669824200"},{"name":"Houari Sahraoui","affiliation":["Department I.R.O., Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Houari","lastName":"Sahraoui","id":"37270403500"},{"name":"Pierre Poulin","affiliation":["Department I.R.O., Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Poulin","id":"37357799800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2157-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1534-5351"}],"articleNumber":"4493326","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software quality","Filters","Software maintenance","Concrete","Computer architecture","Data visualization","Data mining","Software metrics","Application software","Software design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program visualisation","software metrics","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design anomalies","visual detection","software evolution","anomaly candidates code","visualization-based approach","candidates validation","detection strategy","semi-automatic detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software quality","Software metrics","Visualization"]}],"abstract":"Design anomalies, introduced during software evolution, are frequent causes of low maintainability and low flexibility to future changes. Because of the required knowledge, an important subset of design anomalies is difficult to detect automatically, and therefore, the code of anomaly candidates must be inspected manually to validate them. However, this task is time- and resource-consuming. We propose a visualization-based approach to detect design anomalies for cases where the detection effort already includes the validation of candidates. We introduce a general detection strategy that we apply to three types of design anomaly. These strategies are illustrated on concrete examples. Finally we evaluate our approach through a case study. It shows that performance variability against manual detection is reduced and that our semi-automatic detection has good recall for some anomaly types.","doi":"10.1109/CSMR.2008.4493326","publicationTitle":"2008 12th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 12th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489834/4493286/04493326.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSMR.2008.4493326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Detection of Design Anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493326/","displayDocTitle":"Visual Detection of Design Anomalies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9925960","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493326/","conferenceDate":"1-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Detection of Design Anomalies","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"CSMR-00-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05602S","chronDate":"1-4 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4489834","isNumber":"4493286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489834","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4493286","articleId":"4493326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4493362,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Kent, Kent, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4522567/4493362/4493362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiguo Sheng received the M.Sc. in information technology from the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Brunel University, Brunel, U.K., in 2005.","Currently, he is a Research Associate in the Department of Electronics at the University of Kent, Kent, U.K. His research interests include evolutionary computation, heuristic search, and data mining/clustering and their applications to biometrics, security, and bioinformatics."]},"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37276312100"},{"name":"Gareth Howells","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Kent, Kent, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4522567/4493362/4493362-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Gareth Howells received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Kent, Kent, U.K., in 1991.","Currently, he is a Lecturer in Electronic Engineering at the University of Kent.

However, the storage of the biometric templates and/or encryption keys that are necessary for such applications is a matter of serious concern, as the compromise of templates or keys necessarily compromises the information secured by those keys. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which requires storage of neither biometric templates nor encryption keys, by directly generating the keys from statistical features of biometric data. An outline of the process is as follows: given biometric samples, a set of statistical features is first extracted from each sample. On each feature subset or single feature, we model the intra and interuser variation by clustering the data into natural clusters using a fuzzy genetic clustering algorithm. Based on the modelling results, we subsequently quantify the consistency of each feature subset or single feature for each user. By selecting the most consistent feature subsets and/or single features for each user individually, we generate the key reliably without compromising its relative security. The proposed method is evaluated on handwritten signature data and compared with related methods, and the results are very promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10075775","htmlLink":"/document/4493362/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Template-Free Biometric-Key Generation by Means of Fuzzy Genetic Clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Template-Free Biometric-Key Generation by Means of Fuzzy Genetic Clustering","sourcePdf":"03tifs02-sheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069011S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4522567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4522567","articleId":"4493362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4493398,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4493398/4493398-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed was born in Cairo, Egypt, on November 25, 1977.

Severe and random voltage disturbances might be initiated by time-varying loads, nondispatchable generation, voltage transients associated with parallel connected loads, and voltage transients caused by capacitor switching. These voltage disturbances are stochastic in nature, with durations vary from a fraction of a cycle to few cycles. To ensure perfect regulation of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) and provide means for rejecting voltage disturbances, the voltage control loop should offer a high disturbance rejection performance. This paper presents a newly designed grid-voltage control scheme, for the distributed generation interface, based on a hybrid linear with variable-structure control voltage controller. The proposed voltage controller can embed a wide band of frequency modes through an equivalent internal model. Subsequently, wide range of voltage perturbations, including capacitor-switching voltage disturbances, can be rejected. To optimally tune the proposed nonlinear voltage controller, the tuning problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, and solved via an evolutionary search algorithm based on the particle-swarm-optimization (PSO) technique. Therefore, a simple and structured tuning methodology can be obtained. To provide accurate and robust tracking of the generated reference current trajectory, a newly designed robust deadbeat current control algorithm is adopted. Theoretical analysis and comparative evaluation tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","volume":"23","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"9960788","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493398/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Variable-Structure Control With Evolutionary Optimum-Tuning Algorithm for Fast Grid-Voltage Regulation Using Inverter-Based Distributed Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Variable-Structure Control With Evolutionary Optimum-Tuning Algorithm for Fast Grid-Voltage Regulation Using Inverter-Based Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-mohamed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107698S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4493398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4493399,"authors":[{"name":"Jiun-Ren Tsai","affiliation":["Elegant Power Application Research Center EPARC), Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4493399/4493399-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiun-Ren Tsai received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2003, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include design and development of switching-mode power supplies and power factor correction technology."]},"firstName":"Jiun-Ren","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37290512000"},{"name":"Tsai-Fu Wu","affiliation":["Elegant Power Application Research Center EPARC), Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4493399/4493399-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tsai-Fu Wu (S'88\u2013M'91\u2013SM'98) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1983, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Ohio University, Athens, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from University of Illinois at Chicago, in 1992.","From 1985 to 1986, he was employed as a System Engineer in SAMPO Inc., Taiwan, in developing and designing graphic terminals.

Remote measurements are provided to the controller to damp out system modes. The optimal controller is developed based on the heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) approach. Three multilayer-perceptron neural networks are used in the design-the identifier/model network to identify the dynamics of the power system, the critic network to evaluate the performance of the damping controller, and the controller network to provide optimal damping. This measurement-based technique provides an alternative to the classical linear model-based optimal control design. The eigenvalue analysis of the closed-loop system is performed with time-domain responses using the Prony method. An analysis of the simulation results shows potential of the HDP-based optimal damping controller on a GCSC for enhancing the stability of the power system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.908761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4550606/04493402.pdf","startPage":"1673","endPage":"1681","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.908761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Computational Approach to Optimal Damping Controller Design for a GCSC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Computational Approach to Optimal Damping Controller Design for a GCSC","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4493402/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10073239","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Computational Approach to Optimal Damping Controller Design for a GCSC","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd03-ray.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067339S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4550606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4550606","articleId":"4493402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4493404,"authors":[{"name":"George Nagy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["George Nagy (M'66\u2013LF'03) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 1962 (dissertation topic: neural networks).","For the next ten years, he conducted research on various aspects of pattern recognition at the IBM T.

This paper treats the problem of reconstructing a periodic bandlimited signal from a finite number of its nonuniform samples. In practical applications, only a finite number of values are given. Extending the samples periodically across the boundaries, and assuming that the underlying continuous time signal is bandlimited, provides a simple way to deal with reconstruction from finitely many samples. Two algorithms for reconstructing a periodic bandlimited signal from an even and an odd number of nonuniform samples are developed. In the first, the reconstruction functions constitute a basis while in the second, they form a frame so that there are more samples than needed for perfect reconstruction. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Specifically, it is shown that the first algorithm provides consistent reconstruction of the signal while the second is shown to be more stable in noisy environments. Next, we use the theory of finite dimensional frames to characterize the stability of our algorithms. We then consider two special distributions of sampling points: uniform and recurrent nonuniform, and show that for these cases, the reconstruction formulas as well as the stability analysis are simplified significantly. The advantage of our methods over conventional approaches is demonstrated by numerical experiments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04493412.pdf","startPage":"2728","endPage":"2745","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.917416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonuniform Sampling of Periodic Bandlimited Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Nonuniform Sampling of Periodic Bandlimited Signals","volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4493412/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10058982","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonuniform Sampling of Periodic Bandlimited Signals","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-margolis-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124573S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4493412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4493413,"authors":[{"name":"Raj Rao Nadakuditi","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4545245/4493413/4493413-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raj Rao Nadakuditi (S'03\u2013M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, and the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography and Applied Ocean Science in 2007.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with a joint appointment in the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Mechanical Engineering/Center for Ocean Engineering at MIT.

We present a mathematically justifiable, computationally simple, sample-eigenvalue-based procedure for estimating the number of high-dimensional signals in white noise using relatively few samples. The main motivation for considering a sample-eigenvalue-based scheme is the computational simplicity and the robustness to eigenvector modelling errors which can adversely impact the performance of estimators that exploit information in the sample eigenvectors. There is, however, a price we pay by discarding the information in the sample eigenvectors; we highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample-eigenvalue-based detection of weak or closely spaced high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size. This motivates our heuristic definition of the effective number of identifiable signals which is equal to the number of ldquosignalrdquo eigenvalues of the population covariance matrix which exceed the noise variance by a factor strictly greater than . The fundamental asymptotic limit brings into sharp focus why, when there are too few samples available so that the effective number of signals is less than the actual number of signals, underestimation of the model order is unavoidable (in an asymptotic sense) when using any sample-eigenvalue-based detection scheme, including the one proposed herein. The analysis reveals why adding more sensors can only exacerbate the situation. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that the proposed estimator, like Wax and Kailath's MDL-based estimator, consistently estimates the true number of signals in the dimension fixed, large sample size limit and the effective number of identifiable signals, unlike Wax and Kailath's MDL-based estimator, in the large dimension, (relatively) large sample size limit.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","startPage":"2625","endPage":"2638","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04493413.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample Eigenvalue Based Detection of High-Dimensional Signals in White Noise Using Relatively Few Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493413/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sample Eigenvalue Based Detection of High-Dimensional Signals in White Noise Using Relatively Few Samples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10058984","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Eigenvalue Based Detection of High-Dimensional Signals in White Noise Using Relatively Few Samples","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-nadakuditi-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128228S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4493413","onlineDate":"22 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4493429,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Sien Moo","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4636792/4493429/4493429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Sien Moo (M'98) was born in Pingdong, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1953.

The electronic ballast achieves a high efficiency and a high power density through the employment of a high-frequency resonant inverter with an embedded buck-boost converter for power-factor correction and lamp power regulation. The control strategy is realized by a microprocessor along with the acoustic-resonance detection circuit.

There have been a number of approaches proposed for combining or fusing multitask or multimodal information. These can be roughly divided into those that attempt to study convergence of multimodal imaging, for example, how function and structure are related in the same region of the brain, and those that attempt to study the complementary nature of modalities, for example, utilizing temporal EEG information and spatial functional magnetic resonance imaging information. Within each of these categories, one can attempt data integration (the use of one imaging modality to improve the results of another) or true data fusion (in which multiple modalities are utilized to inform one another). We review both approaches and present a recent computational approach that first preprocesses the data to compute features of interest. The features are then analyzed in a multivariate manner using independent component analysis.

Surface electrodes are touted for their ability to record activity from relatively large portions of muscle tissue. Intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) can provide focal recordings from deep muscles of the forearm and independent signals relatively free of crosstalk. However, little work has been done to compare the two. Additionally, while previous investigations have either targeted electrodes to specific muscles or used untargeted (symmetric) electrode arrays, no work has compared these approaches to determine if one is superior. The classification accuracies of pattern-recognition-based classifiers utilizing surface and intramuscular as well as targeted and untargeted electrodes were compared across 11 subjects. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed that when only EMG amplitude information was used from all available EMG channels, the targeted surface, targeted intramuscular, and untargeted surface electrodes produced similar classification accuracies while the untargeted intramuscular electrodes produced significantly lower accuracies. However, no statistical differences were observed between any of the electrode conditions when additional features were extracted from the EMG signal. It was concluded that the choice of electrode should be driven by clinical factors, such as signal robustness/stability, cost, etc., instead of by classification accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of the Effects of Electrode Implantation and Targeting on Pattern Classification Accuracy for Prosthesis Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.923917","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4603151/04493490.pdf","startPage":"2198","endPage":"2211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.923917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of the Effects of Electrode Implantation and Targeting on Pattern Classification Accuracy for Prosthesis Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4493490/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10158551","pubMedId":"18713689","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of the Effects of Electrode Implantation and Targeting on Pattern Classification Accuracy for Prosthesis Control","sourcePdf":"55tbme09-farrell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.20451S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4603151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4603151","articleId":"4493490","onlineDate":"22 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4493496,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Tlich","affiliation":["INNOVAS Society, Lannion, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4550606/4493496/4493496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Tlich (M'04) was born on May 22, 1979, in El Alia, Tunisia.

Powerline communications (PLC) modems rather see a channel which starts almost from 2 MHz . A comparison between coherence bandwidth and time-delay parameters estimated in both frequency bands 30 kHz-100 MHz and 2 MHz-100 MHz is elaborated in this paper. Results are intended for applications in high-capacity indoor power-line networks. The investigation is aimed to show that the PLC channel studies in a band starting from a frequency lower than 2 MHz distorts the real values that an implementer should take, as the PLC modem see only the frequencies from 2 MHz. The coherence bandwidth and the time delay parameters are estimated from measurements of the complex transfer functions of the PLC channels. For the 30 kHz-100 MHz frequency band, the 90 th percentile of the estimated coherence bandwidth at 0.9 correlation level stay above 65.5 kHz and below 691.5 kHz. It was observed to have a minimum value of 32.5 kHz. The maximum excess delay spread results show that 80% of the channels exhibit values between 0.6 s and 6.45 s. And a mean rms delay spread of 0.413 s is obtained. The passage to the 2 MHz-100 MHz frequency band induced an increase of the coherence bandwidth, whose min value is brought back to 43.5 kHz, and an important reduction of the time delay parameters: The min, max, mean, and standard deviation values of the maximum excess delay are almost divided by 2. For the twice frequency bands, this paper studies, also, the variability of the coherence bandwidth and time-delay spread parameters with the channel class , and thus with the location of the receiver with respect to the transmitter, and finally relates the rms delay spread to the coherence bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2007.916095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4550606/04493496.pdf","startPage":"1402","endPage":"1409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2007.916095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Power-Line Communications Channel Characterization up to 100 MHz\u2014Part II: Time-Frequency Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493496/","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Power-Line Communications Channel Characterization up to 100 MHz\u2014Part II: Time-Frequency Analysis","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10073247","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493496/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Power-Line Communications Channel Characterization up to 100 MHz\u2014Part II: Time-Frequency Analysis","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd03-tlich2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058436S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4550606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4550606","articleId":"4493496","onlineDate":"22 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4493497,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Uno period after U Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Mojix, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4545245/4493497/4493497-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-U Lee (A'07\u2013M'07) received the B.Eng. degree in information systems engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computing, both from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From 2005 to 2007, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he developed high-performance hardware designs for wireless communications and mathematical function evaluations.

Using medical profiles such as age, sex, blood pressure and blood sugar it can predict the likelihood of patients getting a heart disease.

The proposed approach is based on utilizing the decoder idle time by introducing two queue s: one at the decoder input and the other at the decoder output. At the presence of an input queue, the decoder runs extra iterations beyond the maximum allowable iterations as long as the input queue is not full. The function of the output queue is to preserve decoder timing, guaranteeing frames to be decoded within a fixed time similar to a conventional LDPC decoder, making it practical for real time applications. Simulation results for a rate Vi (1024,512) progressive edge-growth (PEG) LDPC code show that the proposed approach can increase the decoder performance up to 69% keeping the same throughput, or doubling the throughput while keeping performance almost the same.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493550.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using input/output queues to increase LDPC decoder performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Belief propagation","Digital video broadcasting","Error correction codes","Turbo codes","Error correction","Cyclic redundancy check","Petroleum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","parity check codes","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["input/output queues","LDPC decoder","iterative belief propagation decoding","low density parity check codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC codes","Belief Propagation iterative decoding","Error correction coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Using input/output queues to increase LDPC decoder performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493550/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9925799","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using input/output queues to increase LDPC decoder performance","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"SPI-04162008-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035925S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488216","isNumber":"4493499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488216","xplore-issue":"4493499","articleId":"4493550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4493551,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Y.

In our proposed scheme the number of active receive antennas for spatial multiplexing MIMO detection is determined at the rate of the large scale channel variation which is a function of the path loss and shadowing parameters, while the link adaptation is updated as fast as the coherence time. Hence, in our proposed scheme, the rate of antenna selection is slower than the link adaptation, which is motivated by the fact that the portion of the power consumption is dominated by RF chains during the initial period of the switched-on terminal and some wireless service does not require the large scale mobility. From our analysis we determine the number of the active receive antennas to achieve a certain target ergodic capacity as well as a target link performance and evaluate bit error rate, average spectral efficiency and the outage probability for two MIMO detection schemes such as maximum likelihood and zero-forcing. Some selected numerical examples are finally presented and discussed to illustrate the tradeoff offered by this scheme.","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493553","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","startPage":"325","endPage":"332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow antenna selection and fast link adaptation MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Slow antenna selection and fast link adaptation MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493553/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9925802","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493553/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow antenna selection and fast link adaptation MIMO systems","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"SPI-04162008-00054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.256543S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488216","isNumber":"4493499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4493499","articleId":"4493553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493570,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Elghirani","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, Advanced Networks Research Group, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Elghirani","id":"37689200600"},{"name":"Riky Subrata","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, Advanced Networks Research Group, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Riky","lastName":"Subrata","id":"37326267100"},{"name":"Albert Y.

Data transfer is a primary cause of job execution delay. In this paper we study smart scheduling integrated with replica management optimization to improve system performance. We study the use of genetic algorithm (GA) for the scheduling phase of data-intensive applications. The schedulers proposed incorporate information about the datasets and their replicas needed by the jobs to be scheduled, and co-schedules the jobs and the datasets to the computation node guaranteeing minimum job execution time. We employ a data grid replica management framework for the optimization phase of the replica distribution. In this approach we try to achieve a double optimization effect from both the replica management and the scheduling phases, while integrating scheduling and data replication to improve the performance of the grid system. We evaluate and compare our genetic algorithm (GA) with a Tabu search (TS) and the de facto max-min based schedulers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493570/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9925818","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493570/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance enhancement through hybrid replication and Genetic Algorithm co-scheduling in data grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance enhancement through hybrid replication and Genetic Algorithm co-scheduling in data grids","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"SPI-04162008-00071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053776S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488216","isNumber":"4493499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4493499","articleId":"4493570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493576,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Ning Weng","id":"37087640975"},{"name":"Nandeesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Nandeesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38121036800"},{"name":"Satish Dechu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Satish","lastName":"Dechu","id":"38136092100"},{"name":"Benfano Soewito","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southem Illinois University, Carbondale, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Benfano","lastName":"Soewito","id":"37089048162"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1967-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1968-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"4493576","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493576","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Complex networks","Processor scheduling","Parallel programming","Encoding","Biological cells","Chromosome mapping","System performance","Systems engineering and theory","Organizing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","parallel programming","processor scheduling","system-on-chip","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mapping task graphs","network processors","genetic algorithm","embedded system-on-a-chip multiprocessors","packet processing tasks","automated task scheduling technique","parallel programming complexity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493576","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493576.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","startPage":"481","endPage":"488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping task graphs onto Network Processors using genetic algorithm","abstract":"Network Processors (NPs) are embedded system-on-a-chip multiprocessors that are optimized to perform simple packet processing tasks at data rates of several Gigabytes per second. They are the key components to build a performance-scalable and function-flexible network systems. To meet the performance demands of increasing link speeds and more complex network applications, NPs are implemented with several dozen of processor cores and run multiple packet processing applications in parallel. This trend makes it increasingly difficult for application developers to program NPs for high performance. This paper presents an automated task scheduling technique to address this parallel programming complexity. Our proposed technique is based on GA. By incorporating tasks dependency into scheduling list and encoding task scheduling list as a chromosome, GA can quickly remove the invalid mappings and evolve to the high quality solutions. This technique takes advantage of task-level and application-level parallelism to maximize system performance for a given NPs architecture. The simulation results show that this proposed technique can generate high quality mapping comparing to other heuristics by mapping some sample network applications. This work will also enable researchers and engineers to systematically evaluate and quantitatively understand the NPs system issues including application partitioning, architecture organizing, workload mapping and run-time operating.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493576/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9925824","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493576/","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mapping task graphs onto Network Processors using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping task graphs onto Network Processors using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"SPI-04162008-00077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114095S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488216","isNumber":"4493499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4493499","articleId":"4493576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4493578,"authors":[{"name":"Afsaneh Asaei","affiliation":["Multimedia Research Group, Iran Telecommunication Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Afsaneh","lastName":"Asaei","id":"37712099800"},{"name":"Mohammad Javad Taghizadeh","affiliation":["Multimedia Research Group, Iran Telecommunication Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Javad","lastName":"Taghizadeh","id":"37704290100"},{"name":"Hossein Sameti","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Faculty, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Sameti","id":"37354630300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1967-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1968-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"4493578","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Array signal processing","Speech enhancement","Noise reduction","Power system harmonics","Frequency","Engines","Reverberation","Testing","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker recognition","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["far-field continuous speech recognition system","speaker localization","sub-band beamforming","steered response power","speaker verification","Farsi speech recognition engine"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a distant speech recognition system based on a novel speaker localization and beamforming (SRLB) algorithm. To localize the speaker an algorithm based on steered response power by utilizing harmonic structures of speech signal is proposed. This new scheme has the ability of speaker verification by fundamental frequency variation; therefore it can be utilized in the design of a speech recognition system for verified speakers. Then the performance of the Farsi speech recognition engine is evaluated under notorious conditions of noise and reverberation. Simulation results and tests on real data shows that by utilizing proposed localization scheme, recognition accuracy improves by 28% in high noise and reverberant conditions compared to the accuracy of single channel recognition. The capability of this algorithm in localizing a verified speaker improves system robustness to speech noises and reduces recognition errors up to %52 in the presence of speech noise.","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493578","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493578.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493578","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","startPage":"495","endPage":"500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Far-field continuous speech recognition system based on speaker Localization and sub-band Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Far-field continuous speech recognition system based on speaker Localization and sub-band Beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493578/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493578/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9925826","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-field continuous speech recognition system based on speaker Localization and sub-band Beamforming","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"SPI-04162008-00079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056669S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488216","isNumber":"4493499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488216","xplore-issue":"4493499","articleId":"4493578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4493580,"authors":[{"name":"Jafar Ramadhan Mohammed","affiliation":["Communication Engineering Department, Electronics Engineering College, University of Mosul, Mosul, Iraq"],"firstName":"Jafar Ramadhan","lastName":"Mohammed","id":"38258945200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1967-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1968-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"4493580","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493580","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Speech enhancement","Colored noise","Noise cancellation","Nonlinear filters","Working environment noise","Background noise","Adaptive filters","Array signal processing","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","array signal processing","interference suppression","matrix algebra","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","speech signal enhancement","additive colored noise signal","adaptive blocking matrix","linear prediction error filter","multichannel noise canceller","adaptive noise estimation filter","background noise signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","linear prediction error filter","speech enhancement","inverse modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493580","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493580.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new robust adaptive beamformer for enhancing speech corrupted with colored noise","abstract":"In this paper, a new adaptive beamforming scheme is proposed for enhancing a speech signal degraded by additive colored noise signals in reverberant environment. The good performance of the standard GSC beamformer is severely impaired in complicated acoustic environments. The proposed beamformer uses a new adaptive blocking matrix, which consists of linear prediction error filters (LPEFs) and a multi-channel noise canceller using adaptive noise estimation filters (ANEFs). The new adaptive blocking matrix exploits the stationary characteristics of the speech signal over a short interval of time. Thus most of speech signal can be predicted by the linear prediction filters in the blocking matrix. On the other hand, the background noise signals becomes white. While the ANEFs in the multi-channel noise canceller reconstructs the background noise signals from whitened noise signals. Simulation results, in a noisy and reverberant environment with 0.3s reverberation time, show that the proposed beamformer produces results that are significantly favorable than standard GSC beamformer.

In this paper, two soft computing techniques, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, are used to solve these problems. We proposed SFK-means approach which inherits the advantages of K-means, Fuzzy K-means and Swarm K- means, simultaneously we improve the deficiencies.

Furthermore the concept of data aggregation has been incorporated into the developed model and the improvement in performance is observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling information generation in event-driven sensor networks","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493621","endPage":"823","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493621.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","startPage":"820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493621","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Throughput","Probability density function","Measurement","Mobile communication","Network topology","Condition monitoring","Analytical models","Event detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","information dissemination","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information generation","event-driven wireless sensor networks","data-driven networks","information dissemination","performance metrics","network lifetime","packet throughput","energy utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modelling information generation in event-driven sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493621/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","conferenceDate":"31 March-4 April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9925868","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling information generation in event-driven sensor networks","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"SPI-04162008-00122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035039S","chronDate":"March 31 2008-April 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488216","isNumber":"4493499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4493499","articleId":"4493621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493645,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Xin Zhao","id":"37087166528"},{"name":"Myung-Eun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myung-Eun Lee","id":"37087420454"},{"name":"Soo-Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chonnam National University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Soo-Hyung Kim","id":"37087159506"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1967-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1968-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"4493645","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493645","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Optimization methods","Genetic algorithms","Statistics","Iterative methods","Genetic mutations","Entropy","Random number generation","Iterative algorithms","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","optimized threshold","genetic algorithm","threshold segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493645","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488216/4493499/04493645.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","startPage":"921","endPage":"922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved image segmentation method based on optimized threshold using Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"In image segmentation, threshold segmentation is becoming more and more widely used because of its simplicity and efficiency.

A small positive constant value is used to ameliorate the problem of its diverging when the input power is small. Moreover, it can be a variable, where generalized normalized gradient descent (GNGD) algorithm can be used to update the value based on the a priori error. The steady-state mean square error (SSMSE) performance of the algorithm is expected to improve by using a posteriori error instead of the a priori error. In this paper, a GNGD algorithm based on estimated a posteriori error is derived for use in coefficient update using NLMS algorithm. With simulation results, it is shown that using a posteriori error for updating the small constant value within channel equalizer coefficient update process decreases the algorithm's SSMSE performance sensitivity to varying initial step size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493703/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10059814","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4493703/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized Normalized Gradient Descent Algorithm Based on Estimated a Posteriori Error","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Normalized Gradient Descent Algorithm Based on Estimated a Posteriori Error","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063902S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4493734,"authors":[{"name":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","affiliation":["Communication Signal Processing Laboratory Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeng-Kuang","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37280973600"},{"name":"Yu-Lun Chiu","affiliation":["Communication Signal Processing Laboratory Institute of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lun","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37292303500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493734","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Decoding","Constellation diagram","Solar system","Degradation","AWGN channels","Fading","Speech","Quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","angle differential-QAM scheme","phase ambiguity","flat fading channel","audio-band software-defined-radio","Rayleigh fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential coding scheme","square QAM","continuous transmission system","phase ambiguity","Rayleigh fading","performance analysis"]}],"abstract":"An angle differential-QAM (ADQAM) scheme is proposed to solve phase ambiguity problem in non-data-aided continuous transmission system with square QAM constellation.

The 16-ADQAM system incurs only about 0.5-dB performance degradation as compared to the coherent 16-QAM system under AWGN channel. Generalization to flat fading channel and higher-level ADQAM are straightforward.

We evaluate the performance of two iterative message passing algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493778.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Decoding for Low-Density Parity-Check Lattices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Parity check codes","Lattices","Iterative algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Message passing","AWGN","Sum product algorithm","Additive white noise","Linear code"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","low-density parity-check lattices","LDPC","min-sum algorithm","iterative message passing algorithms","sum-product algorithm","max-product algorithm","Tanner graph representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Decoding for Low-Density Parity-Check Lattices","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4493778/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059846","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Decoding for Low-Density Parity-Check Lattices","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042344S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493781,"authors":[{"name":"Min Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405523900"},{"name":"Seong Keun Oh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Keun","lastName":"Oh","id":"37279129500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493781","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Downlink","Receiving antennas","Interference constraints","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative water-filling algorithm","per-iteration power normalization","multiuser MMSE-precoded MIMO systems","multiple input multiple output downlink systems","optimum per-user power allocation problem","minimum mean square error","inter-user interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO","MMSE precoding","Modified iterative water-filling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we deal with an optimum per-user power allocation problem in terms of the sum capacity in multiuser multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) downlink systems when the minimum mean square error (MMSE) scheme has been used for multiuser preceding. However, MMSE preceding allows some inter-user interference. In this paper, we propose a modified iterative water-filling (MIWF) algorithm with per-iteration power normalization (PIPN) in multiuser MMSE-precoded MIMO systems. In the proposed algorithm, power levels for respectacle users are re-adjusted prior to the consecutive iteration, so that the total transmit power constraint should be satisfied. This normalization can reduce greatly the number of iterations for the iterative water-filling process since the inter-user interference terms at every iteration can be computed more accurately without performance degradation. From computer simulations and complexity analyses, we see that the proposed algorithm has lower complexity but with the same capacity as compared with the original MIWF algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493781","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493781.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Iterative Water-filling Algorithm with Per-iteration Power Normalization in Multiuser MMSE-Precoded MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493781/","displayDocTitle":"A Modified Iterative Water-filling Algorithm with Per-iteration Power Normalization in Multiuser MMSE-Precoded MIMO Systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10065506","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4493781/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Iterative Water-filling Algorithm with Per-iteration Power Normalization in Multiuser MMSE-Precoded MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052426S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4493782,"authors":[{"name":"SeungWon Kang","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"SeungWon","lastName":"Kang","id":"37290240600"},{"name":"KyooHyun Kim","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"KyooHyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292676200"},{"name":"Joonseok Song","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joonseok","lastName":"Song","id":"38126962600"},{"name":"KyungHi Chang","affiliation":["The Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"KyungHi","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292347500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493782","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Interference","Computer aided instruction","OFDM","MIMO","Time-varying channels","AWGN","Discrete Fourier transforms","Performance analysis","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM receiver","intercarrier interference","coantenna interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","time varying channel","SCM-E suburban macro MIMO channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","ICI","CAI"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we verify the sources of performance degradation, which are ICI (Inter-Carrier Interference) and CAI (Co-Antenna Interference), in a MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) - OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system under a time-varying channel with correlation between antennas.

Thus, in a time-varying channel with correlation between the antennas, both CAI and ICI are induced.

To enable the receiver to separate deterministically the preamble streams from each transmit antenna, a given set of subcarriers is attributed to each transmit antenna in the data block which is used as preamble. The receiver can extract the desired transmitted signal by using selectors. The problem is then reduced to a Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) scheme. Our method consists firstly in separating the contributions of the different transmit antennas and secondly in a semi-blind SIMO channel estimation algorithm which uses SVD decomposition of a particular matrix. The scalar ambiguity of the estimated channel is removed by using a reduced number of pilots symbols.","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493797.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"441","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-blind channel estimation based on receiver diversity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Semi-blind channel estimation based on receiver diversity","htmlLink":"/document/4493797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10059852","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-blind channel estimation based on receiver diversity","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104283S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493807,"authors":[{"name":"Young Min Kim","affiliation":["The Graduate school of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"38130180100"},{"name":"Guanbo Zheng","affiliation":["The Graduate school of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Guanbo","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37878961200"},{"name":"Sung Hwan Sohn","affiliation":["The Graduate school of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Hwan","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37285929900"},{"name":"Jae Moung Kim","affiliation":["The Graduate school of Information Technology & Telecommunications, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Moung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293480200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493807","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":493},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Working environment noise","Interference","Matched filters","Computer vision","Degradation","Signal to noise ratio","Noise reduction","Fluctuations","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternative energy detection","sliding window","cognitive radio system","spectrum utilization efficiency","noise fluctuation","spectrum sensing methods","signal detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493807","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493807","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","abstract":"Cognitive radio is one of the most effective techniques to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. To implement the cognitive radio, spectrum sensing is considered as the key functionality because secondary users should identify the spectrum holes and utilize them efficiently without causing interference to primary users. In generally, there are three major spectrum sensing methods, including matched filter, energy detection and feature detection. The most common and simplest method is energy detection. However, the conventional energy detection suffers from large degradation in performance under low SNR environment. In this paper, we proposed alternative energy detection which can estimate the exact power of primary user without the noise effect and lead to the better performance. In order to reduce the effect of noise fluctuation, the sliding window function is utilized to assist the proposed detector. The simulation result shows that our proposed method outperform conventional one.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","startPage":"481","endPage":"485","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493807.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Alternative Energy Detection Using Sliding Window for Cognitive Radio System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493807/","displayDocTitle":"An Alternative Energy Detection Using Sliding Window for Cognitive Radio System","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059857","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Alternative Energy Detection Using Sliding Window for Cognitive Radio System","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044807S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4493825,"authors":[{"name":"Changjin Suh","affiliation":["School of Computing, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changjin","lastName":"Suh","id":"37652658100"},{"name":"Shin-woong Jung","affiliation":["School of Computing, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Shin-woong","lastName":"Jung","id":"38127465100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Linear programming","Spine","Ethernet networks","Telecommunication traffic","Throughput","Bridges","Network topology","Traffic control","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","local area networks","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","layer-2 routing analytic model","Ethernet","distributed layer-2 bridge networks","backbone networks","network topology","traffic pattern","perfect routing","ENDIST","edge node divided spanning tree","light traffic load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear Programming","Carrier Ethernet","Layer-2 routing","maximum flow","STP","MSTP","SPB"]}],"abstract":"Carrier Ethernet integrates distributed layer-2 bridge networks to a backbone network. Since carrier Ethernets use simple layer-2 routing, its performance is lower than that of layer-3 routing methods. We introduce an analytic model that evaluates the routing methods in backbone networks. The model solves the multi- input and multi-output maximum flow problem in backbone networks using linear programming. Our method can be used as follows. Firstly, the model suggests appropriate link capacity if network topology and traffic pattern is given. Secondly, the model shows and compares the performance of layer-2 routing methods including perfect routing and our proposed routing called ENDIST(Edge Node Divided Spanning Tree). In this study, the performance is the maximum throughput that a given routing method can reach. We additionally found many good results about ENDIST. Our analytic model proved that ENDIST outperforms the existing layer-2 standard protocols such as STP, MSTP for any offered load and performs perfectly under medium and light traffic load in the given network, thus enough to say that ENDIST is as good as layer 3 routing from the point of throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493825","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493825.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","startPage":"561","endPage":"566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layer-2 Routing Analytic Model by Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493825","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Layer-2 Routing Analytic Model by Linear Programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493825/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059863","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493825/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layer-2 Routing Analytic Model by Linear Programming","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057979S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493825","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493828,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Ho Baek","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Ho","lastName":"Baek","id":"37399561200"},{"name":"Hyeong-Joo Oh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeong-Joo","lastName":"Oh","id":"38126057800"},{"name":"Seung-Hoon Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hoon","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37292257600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493828","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Signal detection","Delay effects","Computer vision","Radio spectrum management","Frequency","Interference","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing reliability","energy detector","cognitive radio system","time delay","false alarm probability","ROC curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","energy detector","time delay"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel structure where the energy detector has multiples of verification using time delay, in order to improve its performance.

To overcome this demerit many research have been done. The clustering is the one of the representative approaches. In the clustering, the cluster heads gather data from nodes, aggregate it and send the information to the base station. In this way, the sensor nodes can reduce communication overheads that may be generated if each sensor node reports sensed data to the base station independently. LEACH is one of the most famous clustering mechanisms. It elects a cluster head based on probability model. This approach may reduce the network lifetime because LEACH does not consider the distribution of sensor nodes and the energy remains of each node. However, using the location and the energy information in the clustering can generate big overheads. In this paper we introduce CHEF - cluster head election mechanism using fuzzy logic. By using fuzzy logic, collecting and calculating overheads can be reduced and finally the lifetime of the sensor networks can be prolonged. To prove efficiency of CHEF, we simulated CHEF compared with LEACH using the matlab. Our simulation results show that CHEF is about 22.7% more efficient than LEACH.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","startPage":"654","endPage":"659","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493846.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CHEF: Cluster Head Election mechanism using Fuzzy logic in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493846/","displayDocTitle":"CHEF: Cluster Head Election mechanism using Fuzzy logic in Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059875","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CHEF: Cluster Head Election mechanism using Fuzzy logic in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055433S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4493850,"authors":[{"name":"Tsubasa Saito","affiliation":["Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsubasa","lastName":"Saito","id":"38124766900"},{"name":"Shinichiro Haruyama","affiliation":["Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichiro","lastName":"Haruyama","id":"37294389800"},{"name":"Masao Nakagawa","affiliation":["Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masao","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37280969000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493850","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":875},"abstract":"We propose a new tracking method using image sensor (IMG) and photo diode (PD) for visible light road-to-vehicle communication.

Interference is classified into inter-cell and intra-cell interference. While the intra-cell interference is generated by mobiles sharing the same base station, inter-cell interference is generated by the mobiles connected to different base stations. Many inter-cell interference mitigation schemes have been proposed to improve system performance. Most of them focus only on the downlink transmission. As for the downlink transmission, only one mobile is allowed to receive data from the base station at a moment except the broadcast service. However, as for the uplink transmission, multiple mobiles may have access to the base station simultaneously. The uplink inter-cell interference management is, therefore more difficult and important than the downlink. In this paper, we propose the inter-cell interference coordination scheme for uplink non-real-time transmission. This scheme shuts down a cell that injects lots of interference. The design of this scheme is based on the assumption that each base station applies the proportional fairness (PF) algorithm to the scheduling of uplink packets. The simulation results show that we can achieve improved system throughput by applying the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493871","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493871.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","startPage":"777","endPage":"780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-cell Interference Coordination for Uplink Non-real-time Data in CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inter-cell Interference Coordination for Uplink Non-real-time Data in CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493871/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059887","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493871/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-cell Interference Coordination for Uplink Non-real-time Data in CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037652S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4493872,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Heon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Heon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37656821900"},{"name":"Suk Chan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suk Chan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38189668200"},{"name":"Dong Chan Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Chan","lastName":"Park","id":"37289702100"},{"name":"Young-il Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-il","lastName":"Kim","id":"38256032400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493872","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of Channel Estimation for Mobile WiMAX System in High Mobility","abstract":"In this paper, we study channel estimation methods with various curve fitting techniques for mobile WiMAX system and find that they cannot support high mobility sufficiently.

These sensing observations are forwarded a cognitive radio base-station through fading channels, the sensing performance will be severely degraded. In order to mitigate this effect, weighted-cooperative sensing was considered to be a promising way in our previous work, which combines the sensing result of each CR user to improve the performance. However, in practical, the probability of detection is unavailable to calculate in each user.

Numerical results show that the sensing performance is improved obviously as opposed to conventional spectrum scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493873","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493873.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493873","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","startPage":"786","endPage":"790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheme using Clustering in Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Weighted-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheme using Clustering in Cognitive Radio Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493873/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4493873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10065546","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted-Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheme using Clustering in Cognitive Radio Systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05871S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4493874,"authors":[{"name":"Su Bin Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Su Bin","lastName":"Park","id":"38190428600"},{"name":"Ryun Woo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ryun Woo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37299791500"},{"name":"Youn Shik Byun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youn Shik","lastName":"Byun","id":"37277402800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493874","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"The Maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem in multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) channels is a NP-hard problem.

We obtain an initial estimated symbol of the received symbol by Zero forcing (ZF) detector and discriminate the reliability of the initial estimated symbol with RD algorithm. If the reliability of the estimated symbol is high, the estimated symbol is available as transmitted symbol, or else we search for the most reliable symbol by SDR detector. The proposed method has proved to significantly reduce computational complexity and has near optimal performance in simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493874.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"794","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493874","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced Complexity of RD Detector Based on Semi-definite Relaxation for MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood detection","Receiving antennas","Tellurium","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semidefinite relaxation detector","MIMO system","maximum likelihood detection","multiple-input multiple-output channel","NP-hard problem","reliability discrimination detector","zero forcing detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Reliability Discrimination algorithm","Sami-definite Relaxation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reduced Complexity of RD Detector Based on Semi-definite Relaxation for MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4493874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10065547","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced Complexity of RD Detector Based on Semi-definite Relaxation for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04221S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493876,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Bin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Bin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293490400"},{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279318900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493876","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Relays","Performance loss","State feedback","Capacity planning","System performance","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Channel capacity","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","feedback","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward opportunistic relaying","quality based channel state reporting","distributed Rayleigh fading channels","signal-to-noise ratio","feedback link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Opportunistic relaying","feedback amount","quality based channel state reporting","capacity","outage probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493876","abstract":"In this paper, we first provide the closed-form outage probability of opportunistic single relay selection in amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying under the arbitrary distributed Rayleigh fading channels. To select the best relay, information exchanging is essential. However, too many information exchanges may rather impair the system performance due to causing congestion in feedback link as well as increasing overhead. In this paper, we will investigate the performances for the AF relaying through the best relay with quality based channel state reporting (QBR) which is one of the widely accepted ones to reduce the feedback amount. We analyze the feedback amount, average capacity, and outage probability for QBR based selection, which are used to make the comparison to the full feedback scheme. Numerical results show that the QBR scheme can reduce the feedback amount remarkably, but achieve as same capacity as the full feedback scheme when the number of relays K is sufficiently large. For the outage performance, QBR scheme induces no performance loss when the threshold is same as the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493876","startPage":"798","endPage":"801","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493687/04493876.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis for Amplify-and-forward Opportunistic Relaying with Quality Based Channel State Reporting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis for Amplify-and-forward Opportunistic Relaying with Quality Based Channel State Reporting","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4493876/","accessionNumber":"10059888","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493876/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis for Amplify-and-forward Opportunistic Relaying with Quality Based Channel State Reporting","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-1-189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049874S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4493687","articleId":"4493876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4493941,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Young Han","affiliation":["Department of Information & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Young","lastName":"Han","id":"37414996600"},{"name":"Nam Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Nam","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279221500"},{"name":"Jung-Hun Choi","affiliation":["Department of Information & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Hun","lastName":"Choi","id":"38129324400"},{"name":"Jae-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["ITResearch and Development Performance Coordination Division, Institute for Information Technology Advancement, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"38129567700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493941","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":110},"abstract":"This paper presents a technique to estimate the side information superimposed over the pilot and data symbols in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system using the partial transmit sequences (PTS-OFDM) in order to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio. The phases of the rotation vector are added to those of the pilot symbols and those of the data symbols by interlaying them between any two pilot symbols. The receiver restores the data symbols by utilizing the channel estimation of the pilot symbols. Therefore, the bandwidth efficiency is improved by not using the subcarriers that are assigned for the reduction of the PAPR. Also, the enormous increase of the bit error rate which would be caused by incorrectly receiving the side information, i.e. the phases of the rotation vector, is prevented. The simulation results of the bit error rate performance for the BPSK are given using the COST-207 channel model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493892/04493941.pdf","startPage":"1027","endPage":"1031","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493941","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PTS-OFDM Phase-Superimposed over Pilot Symbols","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","AWGN","Baseband","Research and development","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["side information","pilot symbols","data symbols","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","partial transmit sequences","peak-to-average power ratio","rotation vector","channel estimation","bandwidth efficiency","bit error rate","COST-207 channel model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Estimation","OFDM","PAPR","PTS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A PTS-OFDM Phase-Superimposed over Pilot Symbols","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4493941/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059909","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PTS-OFDM Phase-Superimposed over Pilot Symbols","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-2-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062179S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4493892","articleId":"4493941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4493942,"authors":[{"name":"Wahyul Amien Syafei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Wahyul Amien","lastName":"Syafei","id":"37394519800"},{"name":"Kunitoshi Nishijo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunitoshi","lastName":"Nishijo","id":"38131167700"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, lizuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Radrixco.ltd., Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493942","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitters","Throughput","OFDM","Equalizers","Frequency domain analysis","System performance","Interference","Convolution","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","channel estimation","equalisers","mobile radio","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel estimation","cyclic prefix","single carrier wireless system","frequency domain equalizer","mobile communication","robust channel estimation","SC-CP wireless system","training sequences","interblock interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","cyclic prefix","frequency domain equalization","single carrier","wireless"]}],"abstract":"It has been verified recently that single carrier cyclic prefixed (SC-CP) with frequency domain equalizer (FDE) is a promising system for mobile communication and robust channel estimation is needed to build the equalizer's weight. Conventional SC-CP wireless system uses training sequences that put in every packet to get the channel information. This increases the overhead of the system. Here we propose a new channel estimation technique by employing cyclic prefix (CP) to maintain both system performance and throughput for this SC wireless system, with 300 kHz bandwidth and 1.6 Mbps throughput. The CP, which is inserted between blocked data to avoid inter-block interference (IBI), can be viewed as a source of channel information. If we can estimate the transmitted CP by conventional way, we can continue to estimate the channel adaptively. The simulation results show that the proposed channel estimation technique can maintain the system performance and gives 14,9% higher throughput compared with the conventional one when the number of packet is increased.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493892","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493892/04493942.pdf","endPage":"1035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Channel Estimation using Cyclic Prefix for Single Carrier Wireless System with FDE","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493942","startPage":"1032","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Channel Estimation using Cyclic Prefix for Single Carrier Wireless System with FDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493942/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10065572","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493942/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Channel Estimation using Cyclic Prefix for Single Carrier Wireless System with FDE","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-2-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054803S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4493892","articleId":"4493942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4493949,"authors":[{"name":"Kunitoshi Nishijo","affiliation":["Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunitoshi","lastName":"Nishijo","id":"38131167700"},{"name":"Wahyul Amien Syafei","affiliation":["Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Wahyul Amien","lastName":"Syafei","id":"37394519800"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Radrix Company Limited, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"},{"name":"Satoru Ishii","affiliation":["Electronic Systems Division, Futaba Corporation, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Ishii","id":"37269019200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493949","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Bandwidth","Frequency domain analysis","Fading","OFDM","Transmitters","Channel estimation","Peak to average power ratio","Decision feedback equalizers","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Doppler shift","fading channels","field programmable gate arrays","mobile communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","single carrier mobile wireless system","frequency domain equalization","multipath fading channels","channel estimation error","Doppler shift","bit rate 3 Mbit/s","bandwidth 1 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a FPGA implementation of single carrier (SC) wireless system with frequency domain equalization (FDE) to overcome the effects of multipath fading channels.

Phase offset changes fast and must be treated on a symbol basis with much more complicated modeling. In this paper, we present and analyze an efficient phase synchronization method based on PSP (per-survivor processing) for modern satellite systems with multimedia services. When the PSP estimator is implemented by hardware, the complexity is significantly increased. To relieve this complexity, we propose novel synchronization method by changing the number of path according to condition of channels. The number of calculation is reduced consequently and the performance maintains similar to existing PSP because the number of path decrease for various kinds of scenarios of channel conditions. Both theoretical and simulated results are presented for varying simulation parameters. The proposed technique can be applied to the turbo coding-based satellite multimedia communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493982","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4493892/04493982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4493982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4493892","startPage":"1209","endPage":"1212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Phase Estimation Using Turbo Decoding In Satellite Communications System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4493982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Phase Estimation Using Turbo Decoding In Satellite Communications System","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4493982/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059922","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4493982/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Phase Estimation Using Turbo Decoding In Satellite Communications System","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-2-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08741S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4493892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","xplore-issue":"4493892","articleId":"4493982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4493984,"authors":[{"name":"Yoon Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293241900"},{"name":"Jin Young Kim","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"38190558400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4493984","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"abstract":"A recent trend of research on the MIMO-OFDM system pays more attention to reduce complexity for implementation in design receiver structure.

Differential modulation provides simplification of embodiment communication system because channel estimation block is not necessary. And also we apply proposed scheme to convolutional turbo codes (CTC) for playing an important part in MIMO-OFDM system as inner codes. This structure can provide a very close performance to that of the conventional diversity scheme with maximum likelihood (ML) detection without channel estimation block while the receiver structure is highly simplified.

Deep suppression of the interference and convergence speed of weights are also improved.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4494059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494047","startPage":"1489","endPage":"1492","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4494047/04494059.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Subband Method for Wideband Adaptive Beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494059/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Subband Method for Wideband Adaptive Beamforming","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059944","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Subband Method for Wideband Adaptive Beamforming","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-3-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095734S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4494047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4494047","articleId":"4494059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4494060,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Eun Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Eun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38130451600"},{"name":"Hyoungsuk Jeon","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoungsuk","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37285441900"},{"name":"Wooram Shin","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wooram","lastName":"Shin","id":"37692970000"},{"name":"Hyuckjae Lee","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Information and Communications University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyuckjae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292587800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4494060","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Transmitters","Diversity methods","Quality of service","Samarium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","correlation methods","diversity reception","fading channels","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-diversity full-rate transmit beamforming systems","V-BLAST system","correlated fading channels","vertical Bell laboratories layered space-time system","antenna groups","transmitter","spatial multiplexing gain","beamforming gain","transmit signals","diversity gain","space-time code","linear dispersion code","golden code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time code (STC)","Linear dispersion code (LDC)","Golden code","Beamforming","Spatial multiplexing","Full-rate full-diversity gain"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Full-Diversity Full-Rate Transmit Beamforming Systems Combined with V-BLAST over Correlated Fading Channels","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4494060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494047","endPage":"1495","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4494047/04494060.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4494060","startPage":"1493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494060","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel transmit beamforming algorithm combined with vertical Bell laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) over correlated fading channels.

With QBR, the users with SNR higher than a predefined threshold are allowed to send the feedback information. The feedback consists of only two numbers: a positive real value for the channel magnitude and a positive integer for the index of DI vector. A semi-orthogonal user group and the corresponding beamforming matrix are then constructed by a user selection process using the indices of DI vector. Finding an optimal beamforming matrix is generally known as a difficult nonconvex optimization problem, but using DI matrices may greatly reduce the complexity although there exists some loss on the sum-rate. We obtain upper and lower bounds of the average sum-rate of the proposed scheme and compare the performance with that of an established ZFBF scheme in [1]. Numerical results show that these bounds are valid and the proposed method achieves better performance than the ZFBF scheme when the available feedback bandwidth is small (i.e., the number of mini slots in this paper). And very low feedback-rate also can be obtained especially for a large number of users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472919/4494047/04494116.pdf","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1734","publicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2008.4494116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2008.4494116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average Sum-Rate Bound of Multiuser MIMO Beamforming with Direction-Indicating Matrices and Channel Magnitude Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","State feedback","Bandwidth","Feeds","Interference","Transmitting antennas","Base stations","Channel state information","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multiuser channels","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO beamforming","multiuser beamforming","average sum-rate bound","direction-indicating matrices","channel magnitude feedback","quality-based channel state reporting","semiorthogonal user group","user selection","nonconvex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO","beamforming","direction-indicating matrix","quality-based channel state reporting","channel magnitude feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Average Sum-Rate Bound of Multiuser MIMO Beamforming with Direction-Indicating Matrices and Channel Magnitude Feedback","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4494116/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"10059976","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average Sum-Rate Bound of Multiuser MIMO Beamforming with Direction-Indicating Matrices and Channel Magnitude Feedback","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICACT-3-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068899S","chronDate":"17-20 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4472919","isNumber":"4494047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472919","xplore-issue":"4494047","articleId":"4494116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ETRI, NIA","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4494125,"authors":[{"name":"Mihyeon Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mihyeon","lastName":"Ku","id":"38131546100"},{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Hanyang University, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279318900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-135-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-5519-136-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"4494125","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Interference","Receiving antennas","Throughput","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Transmitting antennas","Design methodology","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Tx-Rx beamforming","multiuser MIMO channels","multiple-cell systems","base stations","multiple transmit antennas","transmit beamforming","mobile users","multiple receive antennas","receive beamforming","intercell interference","optimum transmit beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO","beamforming","beamformers","multicell network","intercell interference"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a network model that base stations (BSs) with multiple transmit antennas use a transmit beamforming to communicate with mobile users utilizing a receive beamforming with multiple receive antennas. Under the assumption that BSs cooperate each other, we propose a method of designing jointly transmit beamformers (Tx-BF) and receive beamformers (Rx-BF) in order to cope with the presence of inter-cell interference. In multi-cell environment with MIMO channel, a cooperation among BSs with co-channel can design optimum transmit beamformer form by a differentiation of sum-rate to maximize the throughput of entire network. The specific values of Tx and Rx beamformers can be found from a proposed iterative algorithm reflecting inter-cell interference .

Orthogonal codes are integral part of any broadband cellular systems. In this paper, we studied the performance of DS-CDMA signals with Walsh-Hadamard orthogonal codes, orthogonal gold codes and quadratic-residue (QR) orthogonal codes in a quasi-synchronous transmission. The synchronization error considered is smaller than the chip duration. We evaluate the maximum synchronization error that can be tolerated so that complete error-free despreading is guaranteed for all the three orthogonal codes in the absence of additive white Gaussian noise. This provides insight in the synchronization demands for QS-CDMA systems. Also system capacity (the total bit rate which can be detected) subjected to this synchronization error has been calculated for all the three codes. It has been found that QR orthogonal codes provide maximum allowable synchronization error and system capacity as compared to other two orthogonal codes. The BER performance at different values of synchronization error is also studied. Monte-Carlo simulations have been carried out to verify the numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th International Conference on Advanced Communication

The proposed system architecture is analyzed comparing with conventional single antenna system in uplink. As a result of simulation, the proposed system architecture outperforms the 2~3dB Bit Error Rate (BER) performance in RS-BS, MS-RS, MS-RS-BS uplink.

Important performance parameters for delta-sigma modulators, such as open loop gain, slew rate, settling time, thermal and 1/f noise, output swing, power dissipation, and distortion are investigated and design optimization techniques for the single and two stage amplifiers are presented.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2008.4494255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2008.4494255","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SoutheastCon 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488207/4494235/04494255.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE SoutheastCon 2008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS fully differential operational transconductance amplifier design for delta-sigma modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"CMOS fully differential operational transconductance amplifier design for delta-sigma modulators","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494255/","accessionNumber":"9924565","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494255/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS fully differential operational transconductance amplifier design for delta-sigma modulators","confLoc":"Huntsville, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-04172008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044827S","chronDate":"3-6 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488207","isNumber":"4494235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488207","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4494235","articleId":"4494255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4494266,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Embrey-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jianhua Liu","id":"37279464300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1883-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1884-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-0050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-058X"}],"articleNumber":"4494266","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","OFDM","Channel estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Parameter estimation","Fading","Frequency estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Wireless communication","Data engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","OFDM modulation","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR channel model","finite impulse response","OFDM based communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high data rate transmission","time-dispersive fading channels","packet-based transmission","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","channel model","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can be used to support high data rate transmission over time-dispersive fading channels. Many OFDM-based communication systems use packet-based transmission, where channel estimation is needed for the detection of the information-carrying symbols. The finite impulse response (FIR) channel model is simple and effective for some simulations of the OFDM-based communication systems over the time-dispersive channels; yet, it is only an approximate channel model which cannot be used in the case of accurate channel estimation. Unfortunately, many researchers have overlooked this issue and have been devising channel estimation algorithms squarely based on the FIR channel model. While the channel estimation results from these algorithms can be impressive for the FIR channels, the algorithms can hardly be applied in real-world applications. This paper explains in detail the reason why the FIR channel model is only an approximate one for the OFDM-based systems, trying to discourage the inappropriate usage of this model, which can lead to fruitless efforts. This paper also presents a realistic channel model for the OFDM-based communication systems, which can be used to access the channel parameter estimation algorithms realistically.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Be cautious when using the FIR channel model with the OFDM-based communication systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE SoutheastCon 2008","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2008.4494266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SoutheastCon 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488207/4494235/04494266.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2008.4494266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Be cautious when using the FIR channel model with the OFDM-based communication systems","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494266/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9924576","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Be cautious when using the FIR channel model with the OFDM-based communication systems","confLoc":"Huntsville, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-04172008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051019S","chronDate":"3-6 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488207","isNumber":"4494235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488207","xplore-issue":"4494235","articleId":"4494266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4494268,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Embrey-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jianhua Liu","id":"37279464300"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37279843500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1883-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1884-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-0050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-058X"}],"articleNumber":"4494268","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","OFDM","Wireless LAN","Transmitting antennas","Finite impulse response filter","Polynomials","Interpolation","Receiving antennas","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","MIMO system","wireless local area network system","polynomial fitting method","interpolation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","MIMO system","Wireless LAN standards"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of channel estimation for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless local area network system.

It consists of more than 20% of its central frequency. UWB can be characterized with Ultra-short duration pulses, which has excellent immunity in interference from other radio signals. Pulse shaping and baseband modulation schemes are two of the main determinant factors for its performance evaluation. The objective of this paper is to examine different types of pulse shaping and modulation schemes for UWBs performance evaluation. By considering the natural aspects of UWB, three different types of pulses and three different types of modulation schemes are considered for this study. Our results show that the shape of the waveform affects the bit error rate (BER) performances of pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme in both channels while it has a small effect on the performance of on off keying (OOK) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation schemes. The BER performance of BPSK modulation scheme using RZ-Manchester pulse turned out to be the best in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494274/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9924584","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494274/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modulation schemes and pulse shaping in ultra-wideband","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation schemes and pulse shaping in ultra-wideband","confLoc":"Huntsville, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-04172008-00039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041944S","chronDate":"3-6 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488207","isNumber":"4494235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488207","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4494235","articleId":"4494274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4494275,"authors":[{"name":"Avadh Nandra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, George Washington University, USA"],"firstName":"Avadh","lastName":"Nandra","id":"37689348300"},{"name":"Jivesh Govil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Jivesh","lastName":"Govil","id":"37689346400"},{"name":"Harkeerat Kaur","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication, GGS Indraprastha University, India"],"firstName":"Harkeerat","lastName":"Kaur","id":"38120221100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1883-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1884-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-0050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-058X"}],"articleNumber":"4494275","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Transponders","Satellite communication","Costs","Downlink","Attenuation","Rain","Interference","Polarization","Antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","satellite links","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication traffic","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite link design","satellite communication system","satellite traffic","transponder","optimization","effective isotropic radiated power"]}],"abstract":"The design of satellite communication system is a complex process requiring compromises between many factors to achieve the best performance at an acceptable cost.

AES is a block cipher algorithm that has been analyzed extensively and is now used widely. The hardware implementation of AES algorithm is faster and more secure than software implementation. There are different hardware models to implement the Rijndael Encryption core. This paper addresses the performance of Rijndael AES Encryption algorithm of key length 128 bits. Two hardware models based on HDL and IP core are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

Now, with ubiquitous computing requirements in the fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks and low- power electronics such as MEMS devices, an alternative source of energy is required. Also with the limited capacity of finite power sources and the need for supplying energy for a lifetime of a system, there is a requirement for self- powered devices. The process of extracting energy from the surrounding environment is termed as energy harvesting. Energy harvesting, which originated from the windmill and water wheel, is widely being considered as a low- maintenance solution for a wide variety of applications. There are various forms of energy that can be scavenged, like thermal, mechanical, solar, acoustic, wind, and wave. This paper serves as a survey for identifying the sources of energy harvesting based on various technical papers available in the public domain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded system","Piezoelectric materials","Batteries","Vibrations","Mechanical energy","Capacitors","Wireless sensor networks","Photovoltaic cells","Solar power generation","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","energy conservation","energy resources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting source","embedded systems","ubiquitous computing","wireless sensor networks","low-power electronics","windmill","water wheel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494336","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2008.4494336","startPage":"442","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE SoutheastCon 2008","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE SoutheastCon 2008","pdfPath":"/iel5/4488207/4494235/04494336.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2008.4494336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494336/","displayDocTitle":"A survey of energy harvesting sources for embedded systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 April 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9924645","htmlLink":"/document/4494336/","conferenceDate":"3-6 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of energy harvesting sources for embedded systems","confLoc":"Huntsville, AL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-04172008-00101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.180304S","chronDate":"3-6 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4488207","isNumber":"4494235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4488207","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4494235","articleId":"4494336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4494345,"authors":[{"name":"Hani Saleh","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Saleh","id":"37391220900"},{"name":"Earl E.

The proposed approach takes as input a 3-D sequence of way-points connected by straight flight trim conditions, and ldquosmoothsrdquo it in an optimal way with the goal of making it compatible with the vehicle dynamics. The smoothing step is achieved by selecting appropriate sequences of alternating trims and maneuvers from within a precomputed library of motion primitives. The resulting extremal trajectory is compatible with the vehicle and therefore trackable with small errors; furthermore, it is guaranteed to stay within the flight envelope boundary, alleviating the need for flight envelope protection systems. Yet it can be computed in real-time using closed-form expressions, all nonlinearities due to the vehicle model being confined to the stored library of motion primitives. The new method is demonstrated for the aggressive maneuvering of a helicopter.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.917870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2008.917870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4648319","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4648319/04494454.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494454","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Remotely operated vehicles","Mobile robots","Trajectory","Smoothing methods","Libraries","Strategic planning","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Vehicle dynamics","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","aircraft navigation","motion control","nonlinear control systems","path planning","position control","remotely operated vehicles","sequences","smoothing methods","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle","trajectory smoothing","motion primitive","3D sequence","straight flight trim condition","flight envelope boundary","flight envelope protection system","closed-form expression","nonlinear model","fight control system","vehicle dynamics","aircraft navigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aircraft navigation","mobile robots","motion-planning","optimal control","real-time systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles by Trajectory Smoothing Using Motion Primitives","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10290016","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494454/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494454/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles by Trajectory Smoothing Using Motion Primitives","sourcePdf":"16tcst06-bottasso.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068353S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4648319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4648319","articleId":"4494454","onlineDate":"22 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":4494459,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada","Research and Development Department, Nortel Networks Limited, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4545245/4494459/4494459-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Xu received the B.E. degree from the Department of Telecommunication Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China, in 1998, the M.E. degree from Faculty of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2007.","Since August 2007, he has been working on R&D with Nortel Networks, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Among various DSM techniques, centralized optimal spectrum balancing (OSB) achieves the maximum possible data rates by computing the optimal power spectral densities (PSDs) for all modems in DSL systems. Unfortunately, its computational complexity grows exponentially in the number of users and becomes intractable for large . To reduce the complexity of OSB, this paper exploits the fact that the non-convex optimization problem in OSB can be reformulated as an equivalent global concave minimization problem by representing its objective function explicitly as the difference of two convex functions (dc).

This model can be used for the operation planning of electrical power systems. The developed methodology minimizes the load cuts, limiting them to their importance and establishing different stages for them through the relaxation of the minimum limits of voltage and maximum limits of active power flows through the transformers. For instance, when an emergency occurs, if some operational limits are violated for a short period, fewer loads can be cut at a first stage than would be necessary if those violations would not be admitted. If the emergency does not cease, the remaining cuts necessary to recover the violations are made as a second stage of the strategy. On the other hand, if the contingency ceases, within this break, the system is recovered, and at this second stage, unnecessary cuts can be avoided, admitting only small breakings of operational restrictions. This methodology was tested at a system of 291 buses that is equivalent, in heavy load, to the electric network of the State of Parana in Brazil.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494595/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922147","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Load Shedding Strategies Using Optimal Load Flow With Relaxation of Restrictions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Shedding Strategies Using Optimal Load Flow With Relaxation of Restrictions","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-fernandes.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058057S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4494595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":4494596,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Garcia-Gonzalez","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Tecnol\u00f3gica (IIT), Universidad Pontificia Comillas de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/4494587/4494596/4494596-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Javier Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez (S'99\u2013M'01) received the Industrial Engineering degree with specialization in electricity from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalu\u00f1a, Barcelona, Spain, in 1996 and the Ph.D. degree from the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Madrid, Spain, in 2001.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor of electrical engineering at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, and he belongs to the research staff of the Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Tecnol\u00f3gica (IIT).

To cope with this drawback, hydro pumped-storage units have been proposed in the literature as a good complement to wind generation due to their ability to manage positive and negative energy imbalances over time. This paper investigates the combined optimization of a wind farm and a pumped-storage facility from the point of view of a generation company in a market environment. The optimization model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming problem with two random parameters: market prices and wind generation. The optimal bids for the day-ahead spot market are the ldquohere and nowrdquo decisions while the optimal operation of the facilities are the recourse variables. A joint configuration is modeled and compared with an uncoordinated operation. A realistic example case is presented where the developed models are tested with satisfactory results.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4494587/04494596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494587","startPage":"460","endPage":"468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Joint Optimization of Wind Generation and Pumped-Storage Units in an Electricity Market","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Joint Optimization of Wind Generation and Pumped-Storage Units in an Electricity Market","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922149","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494596/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Joint Optimization of Wind Generation and Pumped-Storage Units in an Electricity Market","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-garciagonzalez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055419S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"469","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4494596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4494601,"authors":[{"name":"Panida Jirutitijaroen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Panida Jirutitijaroen (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng. degree from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2002 and the Ph.D. from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2007.","She is currently an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore.

Favorable system reliability and cost trade off is achieved by the optimal solution. The problem is formulated as a two-stage recourse model where random uncertainties in area generation, transmission lines, and area loads are considered. Reliability index used in this problem is expected cost of load loss as this index incorporates duration and magnitude of load loss. The objective is to minimize the expansion cost in the first stage and the operation and expected cost of load loss in the second stage. Due to exponentially large number of system states (scenarios) in large power systems, direct application of the L-shaped algorithm seems impractical. The expected cost of load loss is therefore approximated by considering only sampled scenarios and evaluated in the optimization. The estimated objective value is called sample-average approximation (SAA) of the actual expected value. In this paper, Monte Carlo sampling and Latin hypercube sampling techniques are implemented. Confidence intervals of upper and lower bound are discussed. The method is implemented to an actual 12-area power system for generation expansion planning and transmission line expansion planning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494601/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922156","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Constrained Multi-Area Adequacy Planning Using Stochastic Programming With Sample-Average Approximations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Constrained Multi-Area Adequacy Planning Using Stochastic Programming With Sample-Average Approximations","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-jirutitijaroen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09104S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4494601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4494603,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson Martins","affiliation":["CEPEL, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Nelson Martins (SM'91\u2013F'98) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Brasilia, Brasilia, Brazil, in 1972 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, U.K., in 1974 and 1978, respectively.","He is with CEPEL, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the development of methods and computer tools for power system analysis, with emphasis on dynamics and control."]},"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Martins","id":"37276156700"},{"name":"Edimar Jos\u00c9 de Oliveira","affiliation":["Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Edimar Jos\u00e9 de Oliveira received the B.Sc. degree in 1984 from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), Juiz de Fora, Brazil, the M.Sc. degree in 1993 from the Federal University of Uberl\u0148dia, Uberl\u0148dia, Brazil, and the D.Sc. degree in 1998 from the Federal University of Itajub\u00e1, Itajub\u00e1, Brazil.","Since 1989, he has been with the Electrical Engineering Department of UFJF.

Rotations of full dimension induce a large decoding complexity, and in some cases it might be beneficial to use multiple rotations of smaller dimension. We also study the diversity reliability exponent in this case, which yields the optimal rate-diversity-complexity tradeoff in block-fading channels with discrete inputs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multidimensional systems","Modulation coding","Fading","Decoding","Constellation diagram","GSM","Error probability","MIMO","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","Gaussian processes","modulation coding","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded modulation","Nakagami-m block-fading channels","optimal diversity reliability exponent","error probability","multidimensional signal sets","complex-plane signal constellations","Gaussian constellations","decoding complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-fading channels","diversity","linear rotations","maximum distance-separable (MDS) codes","outage probability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494687.pdf","startPage":"2367","endPage":"2372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Coded Modulation in Block-Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Coded Modulation in Block-Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494687/","volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494687/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9922032","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Coded Modulation in Block-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit05-guillenifabregas-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048191S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4494673","articleId":"4494687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4494689,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmi Hur","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Mathematics Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Youngmi","lastName":"Hur","id":"37547808900"},{"name":"Amos Ron","affiliation":["Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Amos","lastName":"Ron","id":"37318290100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4494689","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494689","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Mathematics","Solids","Volume measurement","Wavelet transforms","Multidimensional systems","Wavelet coefficients","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local compression-alignment-modified-prediction methodology","high-performance wavelet representation methodology","spatial dimension","high dimensional data representation","linear complexity","solid mathematical theory","L-CAMP system","tensor-product biorthogonal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extremely local wavelets","fast algorithms","fast wavelet transforms","Local Compression-Alignment-Modified- Prediction (L-CAMP)","multidimensional wavelets","performance","unitary extension principle","wavelet frames","wavelets"]}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> A new wavelet-based methodology for representing data on regular grids is introduced and studied. The main attraction of this new \u201cLocal Compression-Alignment-Modified- Prediction (L-CAMP)\u201d methodology is in the way it scales with the spatial dimension, making it, thus, highly suitable for the representation of high dimensional data. The specific highlights of the L-CAMP methodology are three. First, it is computed and inverted by fast algorithms with linear complexity and very small constants; moreover, the constants in the complexity bound decay, rather than grow, with the spatial dimension. Second, the representation is accompanied by solid mathematical theory that reveals its performance in terms of the maximal level of smoothness that is accurately encoded by the representation. Third, the localness of the representation, measured as the sum of the volumes of the supports of the underlying mother wavelets, is extreme. An illustration of this last property is done by comparing the L-CAMP system that is marked in this paper as V with the widely used tensor-product biorthogonal 9/7. Both are essentially equivalent in terms of performance. However, the L-CAMP V has in 10D localness score <emphasis><formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>${\u226a 29}$</tex></formula></emphasis>.

The maximum sum-rate point on the boundary of the MAC capacity region is shown to be the unique Nash equilibrium of the corresponding water-filling game. This result sheds a new light on the opportunistic communication principle. The base station is then introduced as a player interested in maximizing a weighted sum of the individual rates. A Stackelberg formulation is proposed in which the base station is the designated game leader. In this setup, the base station announces first its strategy defined as the decoding order of the different users, in the successive cancellation receiver, as a function of the channel state. In the second stage, the users compete conditioned on this particular decoding strategy. This formulation is shown to be able to achieve all the corner points of the capacity region, in addition to the maximum sum-rate point. On the negative side, it is shown that there does not exist a base station strategy in this formulation that achieves the rest of the boundary points. To overcome this limitation, a repeated game approach, which achieves the capacity region of the fading MAC, is presented. Finally, the study is extended to vector channels highlighting interesting differences between this scenario and the scalar channel case.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","startPage":"2110","endPage":"2122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Water-Filling Game in Fading Multiple-Access Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Water-Filling Game in Fading Multiple-Access Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922036","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494691/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Water-Filling Game in Fading Multiple-Access Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit05-lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082571S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4494673","articleId":"4494691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4494693,"authors":[{"name":"Yajun Mei","affiliation":["H.

In the scenario where the sensors have full access to their past observations, the first asymptotically Bayes sequential test is developed having the same asymptotic performance as the optimal centralized test that has access to all sensor observations. Next, in the scenario where the sensors do not have full access to their past observations, a simple but asymptotically Bayes sequential tests is developed, in which sensor message functions are what we call tandem quantizer, where each sensor only uses two different sensor quantizers with at most one switch between these two possibilities. Moreover, a new minimax formulation of optimal stationary sensor quantizers is proposed and is studied in detail in the case of additive Gaussian sensor noise. Finally, our results show that in the simplest models, feedback from the fusion center does not improve asymptotic performance in the scenario with full local memory, however, even a one-shot, one-bit feedback can significantly improve performance in the case of limited local memory.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494693.pdf","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Optimality Theory for Decentralized Sequential Hypothesis Testing in Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494693/","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Optimality Theory for Decentralized Sequential Hypothesis Testing in Sensor Networks","volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922038","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494693/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Optimality Theory for Decentralized Sequential Hypothesis Testing in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"54tit05-mei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097813S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4494673","articleId":"4494693","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4494699,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Rauhut","affiliation":["Numerical Harmonic Analysis Group, Mathematics, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Rauhut","id":"37393142800"},{"name":"Karin Schnass","affiliation":["Signal Processing Institute, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Karin","lastName":"Schnass","id":"37688317600"},{"name":"Pierre Vandergheynst","affiliation":["Signal Processing Institute, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Vandergheynst","id":"37285157700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4494699","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":347,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":4217},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper extends the concept of compressed sensing to signals that are not sparse in an orthonormal basis but rather in a redundant dictionary.

This paper studies systems with fixed end-to-end delay and shows that feedback generally provides dramatic gains in the error exponents. A new upper bound (the uncertainty-focusing bound) is given on the probability of symbol error in a fixed-delay communication system with feedback. This bound turns out to have a form similar to Viterbi's bound used for the block error probability of convolutional codes as a function of the fixed constraint length. The uncertainty-focusing bound is shown to be asymptotically achievable with noiseless feedback for erasure channels as well as for any output-symmetric DMC that has strictly positive zero-error capacity. Furthermore, it can be achieved in a delay-universal (anytime) fashion even if the feedback itself is delayed by a small amount.

This paper considers the problem of optimizing finite-state machine sources (FSMSs) at the input of finite-state machine channels (FSMCs) in order to maximize the mutual information rate between channel input and output. Our main result is an algorithm that efficiently solves this problem numerically; thus, we call the proposed procedure the generalized BAA. It includes as special cases not only the classical BAA but also an algorithm that solves the problem of finding the capacity-achieving input distribution for finite-state channels with no noise. While we present theorems that characterize the local behavior of the generalized BAA, there are still open questions concerning its global behavior; these open questions are addressed by some conjectures at the end of the paper. Apart from these algorithmic issues, our results lead to insights regarding the local conditions that the information-rate-maximizing FSMSs fulfill; these observations naturally generalize the well-known Kuhn-Tucker conditions that are fulfilled by capacity-achieving DMSs at the input of DMCs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922048","htmlLink":"/document/4494705/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Generalization of the Blahut\u2013Arimoto Algorithm to Finite-State Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalization of the Blahut\u2013Arimoto Algorithm to Finite-State Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit05-vontobel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175798S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4494673","articleId":"4494705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4494707,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron B.

The solution presented herein is a generalization of Uysal-Biyikoglu et al. (2002), which considered energy-efficient transmissions for a group of M packets subject to a single transmission deadline. First, the optimal offline scheduler (vis-a-vis total transmission energy) for packet transmissions with individual packet delay constraints is developed. It is shown that when packet inter-arrival times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the optimal transmission durations of packet m and packet M - m + 1, m isin [1,...,M], M ges 1, are identically distributed. This symmetry property leads to a simple and exact solution of the average packet delay for any i.i.d. inter-arrival times under the optimal offline scheduling. In addition, the packet delay performance for the single transmission deadline model is analyzed and shown to grow monotonically with M and at a rate proportional to radicM. A heuristic online scheduler, which assumes no future arrival information, is also studied and shown to achieve a comparable energy performance to the optimal offline scheduler in a wide range of scenarios. The flexible energy and delay tradeoff provided by the individual delay constraint model is further illustrated via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494708.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","startPage":"2090","endPage":"2109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Transmissions With Individual Packet Delay Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Transmissions With Individual Packet Delay Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922051","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4494708/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Transmissions With Individual Packet Delay Constraints","sourcePdf":"54tit05-wchen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144562S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4494673","articleId":"4494708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4494709,"authors":[{"name":"Gil Wiechman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Wiechman","id":"37294297700"},{"name":"Igal Sason","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Igal","lastName":"Sason","id":"37283328500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4494709","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memoryless systems","Maximum likelihood decoding","Error probability","Error correction codes","Iterative decoding","Block codes","AWGN","Channel capacity","Gas insulated transmission lines","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes","error statistics","Gaussian channels","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood decoding","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved sphere-packing bound","finite-length error-correcting codes","symmetric memoryless Gaussian channel","arbitrary list decoder","discrete memoryless Gaussian channel","error probability","maximum-likelihood decoding","iteratively decoded turbo-like codes","Shannon capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block codes","error exponent","list decoding","sphere-packing bound","turbo-like codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494709","abstract":"This paper derives an improved sphere-packing (ISP) bound for finite-length error-correcting codes whose transmission takes place over symmetric memoryless channels, and the codes are decoded with an arbitrary list decoder. We first review classical results, i.e., the 1959 sphere-packing (SP59) bound of Shannon for the Gaussian channel, and the 1967 sphere-packing (SP67) bound of Shannon et al. for discrete memoryless channels. An improvement on the SP67 bound, as suggested by Valembois and Fossorier, is also discussed. These concepts are used for the derivation of a new lower bound on the error probability of list decoding (referred to as the ISP bound) which is uniformly tighter than the SP67 bound and its improved version. The ISP bound is applicable to symmetric memoryless channels, and some of its applications are presented. Its tightness under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding is studied by comparing the ISP bound to previously reported upper and lower bounds on the ML decoding error probability, and also to computer simulations of iteratively decoded turbo-like codes. This paper also presents a technique which performs the entire calculation of the SP59 bound in the logarithmic domain, thus facilitating the exact calculation of this bound for moderate to large block lengths without the need for the asymptotic approximations provided by Shannon.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494709.pdf","startPage":"1962","endPage":"1990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Sphere-Packing Bound for Finite-Length Codes Over Symmetric Memoryless Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Sphere-Packing Bound for Finite-Length Codes Over Symmetric Memoryless Channels","volume":"54","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9922052","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494709/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494709/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Sphere-Packing Bound for Finite-Length Codes Over Symmetric Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"54tit05-wiechman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100397S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4494673","articleId":"4494709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4494710,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37310961400"},{"name":"Vladimir Stankovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA","Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stankovic","id":"38220838500"},{"name":"Zixiang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zixiang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37278484800"},{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37278812100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4494710","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":505},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Quantization","Decoding","Parity check codes","Transmitters","History","Data compression","Communication system control","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","Gaussian processes","parity check codes","trellis codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiterminal source code design","multiterminal source coding","lossy encoding","joint decoding","multiple correlated source","quadratic Gaussian setup","Slepian-Wolf coded quantization framework","Wyner-Ziv coding","Slepian-Wolf sum-rate bound","channel code partitioning technique","trellis-coded quantization","turbo/low-density parity-check code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CEO problem","multiterminal (MT) source coding","Slepian\u2013Wolf coded quantization (SWCQ)","Slepian\u2013Wolf (SW) coding","trellis-coded quantization","Wyner\u2013Ziv (WZ) coding"]}],"abstract":"Multiterminal (MT) source coding refers to separate lossy encoding and joint decoding of multiple correlated sources. Recently, the rate region of both direct and indirect MT source coding in the quadratic Gaussian setup with two encoders was determined. We are thus motivated to design practical MT source codes that can potentially achieve the entire rate region. In this paper, we present two practical MT coding schemes under the framework of Slepian-Wolf coded quantization (SWCQ) for both direct and indirect MT problems. The first, asymmetric SWCQ scheme relies on quantization and Wyner-Ziv coding, and it is implemented via source splitting to achieve any point on the sum-rate bound. In the second, conceptually simpler scheme, symmetric SWCQ, the two quantized sources are compressed using symmetric Slepian-Wolf coding via a channel code partitioning technique that is capable of achieving any point on the Slepian-Wolf sum-rate bound. Our practical designs employ trellis-coded quantization and turbo/low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for both asymmetric and symmetric Slepian-Wolf coding. Simulation results show a gap of only 0.139-0.194 bit per sample away from the sum-rate bound for both direct and indirect MT coding problems.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494710.pdf","startPage":"2278","endPage":"2302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Multiterminal Source Code Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494710/","displayDocTitle":"On Multiterminal Source Code Design","volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922053","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Multiterminal Source Code Design","sourcePdf":"54tit05-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063552S","chronDate":"May  2008","isNumber":"4494673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"38","articleId":"4494710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4494711,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxia Chen","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yunxia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281021500"},{"name":"Qing Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277327400"},{"name":"Ananthram Swami","affiliation":["Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ananthram","lastName":"Swami","id":"37273357300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4494711","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":303,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1703},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494711","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Throughput","Physical layer","Laboratories","Availability","Robustness","Military computing","Conferences","Wireless communication","Limiting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theory","error statistics","Markov processes","probability","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic spectrum access","spectrum availability","probability","sensing error","joint design","constrained partially observable Markov decision process","separation principle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","opportunistic spectrum access","partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.920248","endPage":"2071","startPage":"2053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4494673/04494711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.920248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Design and Separation Principle for Opportunistic Spectrum Access in the Presence of Sensing Errors","abstract":"Opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) that allows secondary users to independently search for and exploit instantaneous spectrum availability is considered. The design objective is to maximize the throughput of a secondary user while limiting the probability of colliding with primary users. Integrated in the joint design are three basic components: a spectrum sensor that identifies spectrum opportunities, a sensing strategy that determines which channels in the spectrum to sense, and an access strategy that decides whether to access based on potentially erroneous sensing outcomes. This joint design is formulated as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and a separation principle is established. The separation principle reveals the optimality of myopic policies for the design of the spectrum sensor and the access strategy, leading to closed-form optimal solutions. Furthermore, it decouples the design of the sensing strategy from that of the spectrum sensor and the access strategy, and reduces the constrained POMDP to an unconstrained one.

VSIs with a neutral wire connection are important for power electronics applications in three-phase four-wire systems, such as active power filters and uninterruptible power supplies. For medium and large capacity applications, a multilevel three-phase four-wire VSI is a good alternative to a two-level one. However, implementing the pulse width modulation for three-phase four-wire VSIs involves complex calculations, and control algorithms differ for VSIs of different levels and topologies. The proposed generalized PW modulator controls VSIs based on voltage-second approximation, but its implementation is much easier than space vector modulation. Field programmable gate array has been chosen to implement the PW modulator due to its fast prototyping, simple hardware, and software design. Simulation and experimental results are provided. The proposed generalized PW modulator was also applied to the control system of three-phase four-wire active power filters to show its validity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494750/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9944391","htmlLink":"/document/4494750/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A FPGA-Based Generalized Pulse Width Modulator for Three-Leg Center-Split and Four-Leg Voltage Source Inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A FPGA-Based Generalized Pulse Width Modulator for Three-Leg Center-Split and Four-Leg Voltage Source Inverters","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073687S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4494750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4494751,"authors":[{"name":"Chong H.

Electric power is transmitted down through flexible cables of high current rating which are expensive and can suffer from large I\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n R loss. An offshore wind turbine usually has to include the step-up transformer in the nacelle. This adds significantly to the mechanical loading of the tower even new designs aim to reduce the transformer size and weight. In either case, a transformer-less, high voltage, high reliability generating unit for nacelle installation would be an attractive technology for large wind turbines. This study presents a power electronic solution based on a permanent magnet generator design. A multilevel cascaded voltage source converter is developed to synthesize a high sinusoidal output voltage. The dc link voltages of inverter modules are balanced by rectifiers fed from isolated generator coils while the inverter switching strategy equalizes the power sharing between the modules. The switching strategy also reduces the low order harmonics to constrain the sizing of the dc link capacitors. The modulating effect between the ac and dc sides of the inverter is taken into account. This paper describes the generator-converter arrangement, analyzes the inverter switching effects and derives the switching strategy which is verified by simulation and laboratory experiment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multilevel Modular Converter for a Large, Light Weight Wind Turbine Generator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04494751.pdf","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Multilevel Modular Converter for a Large, Light Weight Wind Turbine Generator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4494751/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9944407","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multilevel Modular Converter for a Large, Light Weight Wind Turbine Generator","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-ng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076079S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4494751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4494753,"authors":[{"name":"Farhan I.

Unlike traditional wireless sensors that store energy in batteries, Everlast's use of supercapacitors enables the system to operate for an estimated lifetime of 20 years without any maintenance. The novelty of this system lies in the feed-forward, pulse frequency modulated converter and open-circuit solar voltage method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT), enabling the solar cell to efficiently charge the supercapacitor and power the node. Experimental results show that by its low-complexity MPPT, Everlast can achieve over 89% conversion efficiency with lower power overhead than the state-of-the-art by two orders of magnitude, while enabling charging a supercapacitor up to 400% faster than direct charging.

The proposed topology can inherently benefit from the distance between the generator and the mains because the consequent length and possible layout of the power cables may enable the realization of a significant portion of the dc-link inductance. In order to improve the efficiency and to allow the possible utilization of rugged inexpensive thyristors, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) modulation is not used. Unity fundamental power factor at the mains is guaranteed at any load condition while the fifth and seventh harmonics of the mains line currents can be reduced by proper system design at a desired turbine speed, considered most suitable for its operation. Further harmonic reduction is achievable through an active filter controlled via a newly proposed PWM methodology that does not belong either to a carrier-based or to a classical space vector modulation approach. Such a controller relies on a real-time minimization of a proper functional and is capable of implementing true-feedback current regulation. Experimental results from a 10 kW prototype are presented and validate the developed analytical computations.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04494754.pdf","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Source Topology for Wind Turbines With Decreased Mains Current Harmonics, Further Reducible via Functional Minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494754/","displayDocTitle":"Current Source Topology for Wind Turbines With Decreased Mains Current Harmonics, Further Reducible via Functional Minimization","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960795","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4494754/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Source Topology for Wind Turbines With Decreased Mains Current Harmonics, Further Reducible via Functional Minimization","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-tenca.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15497S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4494754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4494757,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We compare these parameter values to earlier results. Although only used for simulated data in this work, the same method can be applied to measured data as well.

Conventional modifications to the doubly fed induction generation (DFIG) architecture for providing ride-through result in compromised control of the turbine shaft and grid current during fault events. A DFIG architecture in which the grid side converter is connected in series as opposed to parallel with the grid connection has shown improved low voltage ride through but poor power processing capabilities. In this paper, a unified DFIG wind turbine architecture which employs a parallel grid side rectifier and series grid side converter is presented. The combination of these two converters enables unencumbered power processing and robust voltage disturbance ride through. A dynamic model and control structure for this architecture is developed. The operation of the system is illustrated using computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fault Tolerant Doubly Fed Induction Generator Wind Turbine Using a Parallel Grid Side Rectifier and Series Grid Side Converter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921179","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04494791.pdf","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4494791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4494791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Fault Tolerant Doubly Fed Induction Generator Wind Turbine Using a Parallel Grid Side Rectifier and Series Grid Side Converter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4494791/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960779","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault Tolerant Doubly Fed Induction Generator Wind Turbine Using a Parallel Grid Side Rectifier and Series Grid Side Converter","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-flannery.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069735S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"206","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4494791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4494794,"authors":[{"name":"Lie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4494794/4494794-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lie Xu (M'03\u2013SM'06) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1993 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 1999.","Currently, he is with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K. He was with Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, U.K., from 2004 to 2007, ALSTOM T&D, Stafford, U.K., from 2001 to 2003, and the University of Glasgow, from 1999 to 2000.

It is especially designed to operate at a considerably low constant switching frequency, reducing the electromagnetic torque and rotor flux ripples, in order to provide good steady-state and fast dynamic performances. This control is convenient for high power drive and generator applications, with restricted switching frequency. The DFIM is connected to the grid by the stator and the rotor is fed by a two level voltage source converter. In addition, this control method allows to implement a technique that reduces the switching power losses of the converter. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed DTC method effectively reduces the torque and flux ripples at low switching frequency, even under variable speed operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04495539.pdf","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Level VSC Based Predictive Direct Torque Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Machine With Reduced Torque and Flux Ripples at Low Constant Switching Frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4495539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4495539/","displayDocTitle":"Two-Level VSC Based Predictive Direct Torque Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Machine With Reduced Torque and Flux Ripples at Low Constant Switching Frequency","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960775","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4495539/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Level VSC Based Predictive Direct Torque Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Machine With Reduced Torque and Flux Ripples at Low Constant Switching Frequency","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-abad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065694S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4495539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4495547,"authors":[{"name":"Marta Molinas","affiliation":["Department of Electric Power Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4495547/4495547-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marta Molinas (M'00) received the Diploma in electro-mechanical engineering from the National University of Asuncion, Paraguay, in 1992, the M.Sc. degree from Ryukyu University, Okinawa, Japan, in 1997, and the Doctor of Engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2000.","From 2004 to 2007, she was a Post Doctoral Researcher with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim.

A simplified analytical approach based on torque-slip characteristics is first proposed to quantify the effect of the STATCOM and the SVC on the transient stability margin. Results from experiments with a STATCOM and a 7.5 kW induction machine emulating a wind turbine are used to validate the suggested analytical approach. Further verifications based on detailed time-domain simulations are also provided. Calculations, simulations and measurements confirm how the increased STATCOM rating can provide an increased transient stability margin and thus enhanced LVRT capability. Compared to the SVC, the STATCOM gives a larger contribution to the transient margin as indicated by both calculations and simulations. The inaccuracies introduced by neglecting the flux transients in the suggested approach are discussed and found reasonable for an estimation method when considering the simplicity compared to detailed time-domain simulation studies. A method for estimating the required rating of different compensation devices to ensure stability after a fault is suggested based on the same approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04495547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Voltage Ride Through of Wind Farms With Cage Generators: STATCOM Versus SVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4495547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Voltage Ride Through of Wind Farms With Cage Generators: STATCOM Versus SVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4495547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960789","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4495547/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Voltage Ride Through of Wind Farms With Cage Generators: STATCOM Versus SVC","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-molinas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073577S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"296","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4495547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":4495549,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed El Moursi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4495549/4495549-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammed El Moursi was born in Mansoura, Egypt, on July 5, 1975.

A specific design of the proposed control algorithm for a wind turbine equipped with a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is presented. The aerodynamic characteristics of the wind turbine are approximated by a Gaussian radial basis function network based nonlinear input-output mapping. Based on this nonlinear mapping, the wind speed is estimated from the measured generator electrical output power while taking into account the power losses in the WTG and the dynamics of the WTG shaft system. The estimated wind speed is then used to determine the optimal DFIG rotor speed command for maximum wind power extraction. The DFIG speed controller is suitably designed to effectively damp the low-frequency torsional oscillations. The resulting WTG system delivers maximum electrical power to the grid with high efficiency and high reliability without mechanical anemometers. The validity of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulation studies on a 3.6MW WTG system. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed wind speed estimation algorithm is demonstrated by experimental studies on a small emulational WTG system.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.921185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4509502/04495554.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.921185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4509502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wind Speed Estimation Based Sensorless Output Maximization Control for a Wind Turbine Driving a DFIG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4495554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4495554/","displayDocTitle":"Wind Speed Estimation Based Sensorless Output Maximization Control for a Wind Turbine Driving a DFIG","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960793","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4495554/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wind Speed Estimation Based Sensorless Output Maximization Control for a Wind Turbine Driving a DFIG","sourcePdf":"23tpel03-qiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082015S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4509502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"4509502","articleId":"4495554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4495558,"authors":[{"name":"Veeramraju Tirumala Somasekhar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Warangal, Andhra Pradesh, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4509502/4495558/4495558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Veeramraju Tirumala Somasekhar received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from Regional Engineering College Warangal (presently the National Institute of Technology), Warangal, India, in 1988, the M.Tech degree in power electronics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 2003.","He was an R&D Engineer at M/s Perpetual Power Technologies, Bangalore, India, and a Senior Engineer at M/s Kirloskar Electric Co., Ltd., Mysore, India.

Security for WSNs is an area that needs to be considered in order to protect the functionality of these networks, the data they convey and the location of their members. The security models and protocols used in wired and other networks are not suited to WSNs because of their severe resource constraints, especially concerning energy. In this article, we propose a centralized intrusion detection scheme based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and sliding windows. We find that our system can detect black hole attacks and selective forwarding attacks with high accuracy without depleting the nodes of their energy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4496866/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4496866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9940302","conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Selective Forwarding Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks using Support Vector Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Selective Forwarding Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks using Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"ISSNIP-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061616S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489863","isNumber":"4496790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489863","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4496790","articleId":"4496866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4496871,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Forster","affiliation":["University of Lugano, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Forster","id":"37581603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1501-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1502-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4496871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2550},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Ad hoc networks","Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Network topology","Machine learning algorithms","Costs","Mobile communication","Portable computers","Personal digital assistants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile radio","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning techniques","wireless ad-hoc networks:","wireless sensor networks","mobile ad-hoc networks","data routing","MANET"]}],"abstract":"This work is a survey on the usage of machine learning techniques in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).

For the rotor resistance estimation, the error between the measured stator current and the estimated stator resistance using neural network is back propagated to adjust the weights of the neural network. The rotor speed is extracted from the induction motor state equations. The performance of the stator and rotor resistance estimators are investigated with the help of measured the stator voltage and current.

Particles in PSO tend to re-explore already visited bad solution regions of search space because they do not learn as a whole.

This paper presents hybrids of estimation of distribution algorithm and two PSO variants. These algorithms are tested on benchmark functions having high dimensionalities. Results indicate that the methods strengthen the global optimization abilities of PSO and therefore, serve as attractive choices to determine solutions to optimization problems in areas including sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4496900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9940355","htmlLink":"/document/4496900/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Estimation of Distribution Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Estimation of Distribution Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"ISSNIP-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050991S","chronDate":"3-6 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489863","isNumber":"4496790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489863","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4496790","articleId":"4496900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4496912,"authors":[{"name":"Jafar Ramadhan Mohammed","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering College, University of Mosul, Mosul, Iraq"],"firstName":"Jafar Ramadhan","lastName":"Mohammed","id":"38258945200"},{"name":"Gurnam Singh","affiliation":["Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, India"],"firstName":"Gurnam","lastName":"Singh","id":"37633090800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1501-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1502-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4496912","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Adaptive arrays","Speech enhancement","Auditory system","Noise cancellation","Adaptive filters","Noise robustness","Nonlinear filters","Working environment noise","Inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","array signal processing","handicapped aids","medical signal processing","sensor arrays","signal denoising","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamformer sensor array","speech enhancement","hearing aid","noise canceling performance","adaptive blocking matrix","linear prediction error filters","adaptive noise estimation filters","National Instruments NI- PXI-1042Q controller system","data acquisition card","NI-PXI- 4472"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor arrays","noise reduction","adaptive beamformer","linear prediction error filters","LabVIEW"]}],"abstract":"The objective of this paper is to provide improved real-time noise canceling performance while keeping the high quality of enhanced speech by using new robust adaptive beamformer.

To overcome these problems, the connection of the PVAs to a multilevel diode-clamped converter is considered in this paper. A control and pulsewidth-modulation scheme is proposed, capable of independently controlling the operating voltage of each PVA. Compared to a conventional two-level inverter system, the proposed system configuration allows one to extract maximum power, to reduce the devices voltage rating (with the subsequent benefits in device-performance characteristics), to reduce the output-voltage distortion, and to increase the system efficiency. Simulation and experimental tests have been conducted with three PVAs connected to a four-level three-phase diode-clamped converter to verify the good performance of the proposed system configuration and control strategy.","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4550662/04497160.pdf","startPage":"2713","endPage":"2723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

PV energy systems are fairly reliable, but as any complex system, they may fail. In PV systems, the inverter is responsible for the majority of failures, and most inverter failures are blamed on the aluminum electrolytic capacitors typically used in the dc bus. This paper investigates the effects of common failure modes on the reliability of PV inverters and suggests a model framework for decomposing the inverter into subsystems for more detailed study. The challenges of statistical analysis based on small data sets are discussed, and simulations are performed to illustrate the proposed model using a simple decomposition into subsystems of the inverter used in the 342-kW PV system at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.924017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4550662/04497163.pdf","startPage":"2581","endPage":"2592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.924017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Methodology for Improving Photovoltaic Inverter Reliability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497163/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Methodology for Improving Photovoltaic Inverter Reliability","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10074572","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497163/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Methodology for Improving Photovoltaic Inverter Reliability","sourcePdf":"55tie07-ristow.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104022S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4550662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"4550662","articleId":"4497163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4497188,"authors":[{"name":"Theodore J.

This paper studies a simplified model of such inference problems in which one or more Boolean variables, modeling, for example, the expression levels of genes, each depend deterministically on a small but unknown subset of a large number of Boolean input variables. Our model assumes that the expression data comprises a time series, in which successive samples may be correlated. We provide bounds on the expected amount of data needed to infer the correct relationships between output and input variables. These bounds improve and generalize previous results for Boolean network inference and continuous-time switching network inference. Although the computational problem is intractable in general, we describe a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm that is guaranteed to provide at least a partial solution to the problem. Most interestingly, both the sample complexity and computational complexity of the problem depend on the strength of correlations between successive samples in the time series but in opposing ways. Uncorrelated samples minimize the total number of samples needed while maximizing computational complexity; a strong correlation between successive samples has the opposite effect. This observation has implications for the design of experiments for measuring gene expression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497188/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2010","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105222","pubMedId":"20150674","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Trade-Off between Sample Complexity and Computational Complexity in Learning Boolean Networks from Time-Series Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trade-Off between Sample Complexity and Computational Complexity in Learning Boolean Networks from Time-Series Data","sourcePdf":"ttb2010010118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102754S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"5405961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5405961","articleId":"4497188","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4497193,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitri V.

Strings comprise both real numbers and the don't care symbol in order to encode a variable number of clusters. Here, assignment of points to different clusters are done based on a point symmetry (PS)-based distance rather than the Euclidean distance. A newly proposed PS-based cluster validity index, sym-index, is used as a measure of the validity of the corresponding partitioning. The algorithm is, therefore, able to detect both convex and nonconvex clusters irrespective of their sizes and shapes as long as they possess the symmetry property. Kd-tree-based nearest neighbor search is used to reduce the complexity of computing PS-based distance. A proof on the convergence property of variable string length genetic algorithm with PS- distance-based clustering (VGAPS-clustering) technique is also provided. The effectiveness of VGAPS-clustering compared to variable string length genetic K-means algorithm (GCUK-clustering) and one recently developed weighted sum validity function-based hybrid niching genetic algorithm (HNGA-clustering) is demonstrated for nine artificial and five real-life data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2008.79","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/4629883/04497194.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2008.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4629883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Point Symmetry-Based Clustering Technique for Automatic Evolution of Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Point Symmetry-Based Clustering Technique for Automatic Evolution of Clusters","volume":"20","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2008","accessionNumber":"10208601","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497194/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Point Symmetry-Based Clustering Technique for Automatic Evolution of Clusters","sourcePdf":"ttk2008111441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03973S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"4629883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"106","articleId":"4497194","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4497199,"authors":[{"name":"Ozan K.

In this paper, we provide a unified mathematical framework for dynamic load balancing, which leads to closed-form performance expressions for evaluating the performance of some of the most important dynamic load balancing strategies proposed in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generic theoretical framework that can be used to evaluate the performance of many different dynamic load balancing schemes with simple closed-form results. The accuracy of the results predicted by these analytical expressions derived from the theoretical framework is checked by comparing these results with simulation results provided in the literature for well-known schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10312083","htmlLink":"/document/4497199/","displayDocTitle":"The Mathematical Theory of Dynamic Load Balancing in Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Mathematical Theory of Dynamic Load Balancing in Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2008121504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092283S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4670321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4670321","articleId":"4497199","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497204,"authors":[{"name":"Saad M.

We present a multi-view approach to solving this problem. In our approach we neither detect nor track objects from any single camera or camera pair; rather evidence is gathered from all the cameras into a synergistic framework and detection and tracking results are propagated back to each view. Unlike other multi-view approaches that require fully calibrated views our approach is purely image-based and uses only 2D constructs. To this end we develop a planar homographic occupancy constraint that fuses foreground likelihood information from multiple views, to resolve occlusions and localize people on a reference scene plane. For greater robustness this process is extended to multiple planes parallel to the reference plane in the framework of plane to plane homologies. Our fusion methodology also models scene clutter using the Schmieder and Weathersby clutter measure, which acts as a confidence prior, to assign higher fusion weight to views with lesser clutter. Detection and tracking are performed simultaneously by graph cuts segmentation of tracks in the space-time occupancy likelihood data. Experimental results with detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis, are demonstrated in challenging multi-view, crowded scenes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking Multiple Occluding People by Localizing on Multiple Scene Planes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.102","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4758536/04497204.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758536","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497204/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Tracking Multiple Occluding People by Localizing on Multiple Scene Planes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4497204/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10401615","pubMedId":"19147878","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking Multiple Occluding People by Localizing on Multiple Scene Planes","sourcePdf":"ttp2009030505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119429S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4758536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"4758536","articleId":"4497204","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497208,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Murphy-Chutorian","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4785439/4497208/4497208-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik Murphy-Chutorian received the BA degree in engineering physics from Dartmouth College in 2002 and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), in 2005.

The research community is working in this area and, as a very recent line, they are assuming the Model-Driven paradigm to support and solve some classic problems detected in Web developments. However, there is a lack in Web requirements treatment. This paper presents a general vision of NDT (Navigational Development Techniques) which is an approach to deal with requirements in Web systems. It is based on conclusions obtained in several comparative studies and it tries to fill some gaps detected by the research community. This paper presents its scope, its most important contributions and offers a global vision of its associated tool: NDT-Tool. Furthermore, it analyses how Web Engineering can be applied in the enterprise environment.

In the magnet system, low temperature superconducting coils are immersed in a subcooled 1.8 K bath, which is connected to the saturated helium reservoir through the weight load relief valve. Saturated liquid helium is refrigerated by a Joule-Thomson (JT) heat exchanger and flows through the JT valve, isenthalpically dropping its pressure to approximately 1.6 kPa, corresponding to a saturation temperature of 1.8 K. Helium gas exhausted from JT pump is liquefied by a two-stage cryocooler located after the vapor purify system. In the present paper, the amount of heat budget is determined and the structural design of cryostat is carried out by the relevant analyses. The position of a cryocooler in the magnet system is investigated, taking into account the requirement of magnetic field for normal performance. Helium liquefaction system, a key component of the closed-loop cooling system, is fabricated and tested in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our new cryogenic cooling for high field magnets.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/4538104/04497221.pdf","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2008.922538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2008.922538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Loop Cryogenic Cooling for a 21 T FT-ICR Magnet System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryogenics","Cooling","Superconducting magnets","Saturation magnetization","Magnetic resonance","Temperature","Valves","Fourier transforms","Cyclotrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","cryogenics","cyclotron resonance","Fourier transforms","heat exchangers","Joule-Thomson effect","superconducting coils","superconducting magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop cryogenic cooling","FT-ICR superconducting magnet system","Fourier transform","ion cyclotron resonance","superconducting coil","saturated liquid helium","Joule-Thomson heat exchanger","vapor purify system","magnetic flux density 21 T"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryogenic cooling","heat loads","radiation shield","superconducting magnets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Loop Cryogenic Cooling for a 21 T FT-ICR Magnet System","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4497221/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10075134","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Loop Cryogenic Cooling for a 21 T FT-ICR Magnet System","sourcePdf":"18tasc02-choi6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048141S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"4538104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4538104","articleId":"4497221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497228,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 A.

Furthermore, all control algorithms used in the classical series-connected MPPT can be applied to the parallel system. A simple bidirectional dc-dc power converter is proposed for the MPPT implementation and presents the functions of battery charger and step-up converter. The operation characteristics of the proposed circuit are analyzed with the implementation of a prototype in a practical application.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.924033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4550662/04497230.pdf","startPage":"2674","endPage":"2683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.924033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Maximum Power Point Tracking System With Parallel Connection for PV Stand-Alone Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497230/","displayDocTitle":"A Maximum Power Point Tracking System With Parallel Connection for PV Stand-Alone Applications","volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10074564","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497230/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Maximum Power Point Tracking System With Parallel Connection for PV Stand-Alone Applications","sourcePdf":"55tie07-gules.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0629S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4550662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"205","xplore-issue":"4550662","articleId":"4497230","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4497234,"authors":[{"name":"Dezso Sera","affiliation":["Institute of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4550662/4497234/4497234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dezso Sera (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in drives automation with energetic performances from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2001 and 2002, respectively.

The rapidly changing conditions are tracked by an optimized hill-climbing MPPT method called dP-P&O. This algorithm separates the effects of the irradiation change from the effect of the tracker's perturbation and uses this information to optimize the tracking according to the irradiation change. The knowledge of the direction of the irradiation change enables the MPPT to use different optimized tracking schemes for the different cases of increasing, decreasing, or steady irradiance. When the irradiance is changing rapidly this strategy leads to faster and better tracking, while in steady-state conditions it leads to lower oscillations around the MPP. The simulations and experimental results show that the proposed dP-P&O MPPT provides a quick and accurate tracking even in very fast changing environmental conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497234/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10074575","volume":"55","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Maximum Power Point Tracker for Fast-Changing Environmental Conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Maximum Power Point Tracker for Fast-Changing Environmental Conditions","sourcePdf":"55tie07-sera.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082238S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4550662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"298","xplore-issue":"4550662","articleId":"4497234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497236,"authors":[{"name":"Kira L.

CCILC is a new method in which a multi-axis cross-coupled controller (CCC) is reformatted into a single-input single-output (SISO) ILC format. Applying the techniques of ILC to CCC enables learning of the cross-coupled error which leads to a modified control signal and subsequent improvements in the contour trajectory tracking performance. In this paper, performance of the combined ILC and CCILC system is compared to standard feedback control through computer simulations and experimental testing on a Cartesian robotic system. Sufficient stability and convergence properties for the combined system are presented along with a modified approach for determining monotonic convergence of systems that are computationally challenging.

Suppose that the sensors in the network record local measurements of a common event and report the data back to the fusion center through direct transmission links. We employ a channel-aware transmission control where the transmission probability of each sensor is chosen according to the quality of its local observation and transmission channels. As opposed to maximizing the system throughput, our goal is to design transmission control policies that optimize the estimation performance. Two transmission control strategies are proposed: the maximum mean-square-error (MSE) reduction (MMR) scheme and the suboptimal two-mode MSE-reduction (TMMR) scheme. The MMR maximizes the MSE-reduction of the estimate after each time slot. However, this method requires knowledge of the number of active sensors and the accumulated estimation performance in each time slot, which must be provided through feedback from the fusion center. In TMMR, the sensors switch between two predetermined transmission control functions without explicit knowledge of the estimation performance and the number of active sensors in each time slot. Moreover, we notice that, if new observations are made by the sensors in each time slot, diversity combining techniques can be employed to fully exploit the data that the sensors measure over their idle time slots. Specifically, we perform selective combining on the observations that are made in between transmissions. As a result, we are able to exploit both the spatial and temporal diversity gains inherent in the multisensor system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.917382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545245","startPage":"2967","endPage":"2980","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4545245/04497242.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Aware Random Access Control for Distributed Estimation in Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497242/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Channel-Aware Random Access Control for Distributed Estimation in Sensor Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10064535","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-Aware Random Access Control for Distributed Estimation in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"56tsp07-hong-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080863S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4545245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4545245","articleId":"4497242","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4497245,"authors":[{"name":"Alistair Duffy","affiliation":["Applied Electromagnetics Group, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Alistair","lastName":"Duffy","id":"37277330000"},{"name":"Antonio Orlandi","affiliation":["Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Quer\u00e9taro (UAq) Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory, University of L'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Orlandi","id":"37269551000"},{"name":"Hugh Sasse","affiliation":["Applied Electromagnetics Group, De Montfort University, Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Hugh","lastName":"Sasse","id":"37847130200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"4497245","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiplexing","Computational modeling","Low pass filters","Electromagnetics","Computational electromagnetics","Mirrors","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic compatibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offset difference measure enhancement","feature-selective validation method","FSV method","computational electromagnetics","amplitude difference measure","ODM measure","EMC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature-selective validation (FSV)","numerical modeling","repeatability","validation"]},{"kwd":["Feature selective validation (FSV)","numerical modeling","repeatability","validation"]}],"abstract":"The feature-selective validation (FSV) method is proving itself to be a robust and helpful technique to quantify visually complex measurement sets, such as those resulting from computational electromagnetic validation exercises or experimental repeatability studies.

In classical repetition protocols, a receiver requests a retransmission in case FEC-decoding fails. In this work we revise and summarize our recent results that show the benefits of using the retransmission request bit(s) not only to request a retransmission, but also to inform coarsely the transmitter about the actual channel condition. Our goal is to simultaneously enable the performance gain due to retransmission and to power control at the transmitter. We give an explicit protocol construction for any number of retransmissions and any number of feedback bits, and show remarkable throughput improvements, especially at low and moderate SNR (signal to noise ratio). For the case of a single retransmission and a single feedback bit, we show that the repetition is not needed at low SNR and that the throughput improvement is due to power control only, which allows to turn off transmission when the channel is in deep fade. On the other hand, at high SNR, the repetition turns out to be useful, and the performance gain comes form a combination of power control and ability to send more redundancy bits through repetition.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492956/4497250/04497266.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"21","doi":"10.1109/IZS.2008.4497266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZS.2008.4497266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repetition protocols and channel state information in block-fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Repetition protocols and channel state information in block-fading channels","htmlLink":"/document/4497266/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","accessionNumber":"10013409","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetition protocols and channel state information in block-fading channels","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"IZS-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044546S","chronDate":"12-14 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492956","isNumber":"4497250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492956","xplore-issue":"4497250","articleId":"4497266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497267,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hossein Manshaei","affiliation":["Laboratory for computer Communications and Applications (LCA), EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hossein","lastName":"Manshaei","id":"37280402200"},{"name":"Julien Freudiger","affiliation":["Laboratory for computer Communications and Applications (LCA), EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Freudiger","id":"37400280000"},{"name":"Mark Felegyhazi","affiliation":["Laboratory for computer Communications and Applications (LCA), EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Felegyhazi","id":"37295804900"},{"name":"Peter Marbach","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Marbach","id":"37273153500"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Hubaux","affiliation":["Laboratory for computer Communications and Applications (LCA), EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Hubaux","id":"37273270200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1682-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3847"}],"articleNumber":"4497267","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Subscriptions","Nash equilibrium","Quality of service","Seminars","Laboratories","Computer applications","Computer networks","Application software","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless social community network","game-theoretic analysis","WiFi access point","licensed band operator"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Social Community Networks: A Game-Theoretic Analysis","doi":"10.1109/IZS.2008.4497267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497250","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492956/4497250/04497267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZS.2008.4497267","startPage":"22","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497267","abstract":"Wireless social community networks formed by users with a WiFi access point have been created as an alternative to traditional wireless networks that operate in the licensed spectrum.

The unrelenting progress of semiconductor technology exemplified by Moore's Law provides an efficient platform for implementing signal processing techniques in the electrical domain leading to what is known as electronic dispersion compensation (EDC). In this paper, we provide an overview of some of the driving factors that limit the performance of optical links and provide a design example of an MLSE-based receiver for 10 Gb/sec long haul links.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZS.2008.4497273","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492956/4497250/04497273.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"51","doi":"10.1109/IZS.2008.4497273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic Equalization of Fiber Optic Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Equalization of Fiber Optic Links","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497273/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10013417","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497273/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Equalization of Fiber Optic Links","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"IZS-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045143S","chronDate":"12-14 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492956","isNumber":"4497250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492956","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4497250","articleId":"4497273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4497277,"authors":[{"name":"Iryna Andriyanova","affiliation":["EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Iryna","lastName":"Andriyanova","id":"37546590700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1682-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3847"}],"articleNumber":"4497277","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Error probability","Seminars","Channel capacity","Approximation algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Turbo codes","Concatenated codes","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-length scaling law performance","repeat-accumulate codes","waterfall region","binary erasure channel","LDPC codes","RA codes","error probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497277","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492956/4497250/04497277.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZS.2008.4497277","doi":"10.1109/IZS.2008.4497277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497250","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Length Scaling of Repeat-Accumulate Codes on the BEC","abstract":"In this paper we consider the finite-length performance of Repeat-Accumulate codes in the waterfall region assuming the transmission on the binary erasure channel.

Nonetheless, Baum et al. (2004) have shown that phase noise of the transmitter and receiver local oscillators, when it is assumed to be a white Gaussian random process, can cause up to around 100 % errors of the estimated channel capacity of a low-rank MIMO channel when using the standard channel matrix estimator. Experimental evidence shows that consecutive phase noise samples affecting measurement samples collected with real TDM-MIMO channel sounders are correlated. In addition the spatio-temporal aperture induced by the selected switching schemes has an impact on the ordering of the phase noise samples in the estimation of the channel matrix estimate. This paper investigates how both effects affect the channel capacity estimator based on the standard channel matrix estimator. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations that by using an experimentally obtained ARMA model of phase noise the predicted error of the ergodic capacity estimate is reduced compared to the case where phase noise is white and Gaussian. We also show that the estimated ergodic capacity is highly influenced by the choice of the spatio-temporal aperture.","doi":"10.1109/IZS.2008.4497292","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Zurich Seminar on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492956/4497250/04497292.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IZS.2008.4497292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497250","startPage":"128","endPage":"131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of TDM in Estimation of MIMO Channel Capacity from Phase-Noise Impaired Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of TDM in Estimation of MIMO Channel Capacity from Phase-Noise Impaired Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497292/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 March 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10013438","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497292/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of TDM in Estimation of MIMO Channel Capacity from Phase-Noise Impaired Measurements","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"IZS-00-42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05512S","chronDate":"12-14 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492956","isNumber":"4497250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492956","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4497250","articleId":"4497292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497293,"authors":[{"name":"Maya Badr","affiliation":["E.N.S.T, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Maya","lastName":"Badr","id":"37410594700"},{"name":"Jean-Claude Belfiore","affiliation":["E.N.S.T, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1681-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1682-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-3839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-3847"}],"articleNumber":"4497293","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"abstract":"In this work, we consider the multiple access channel without channel side information at the transmitters, which have received considerable attention these last years.

Finally, three simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4522590/04497309.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.918568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.918568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4522590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Perturbed Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Backstepping","Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Delay effects","Uncertainty","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","delays","feedback","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural control","perturbed strict-feedback nonlinear time-delay system","radial basis function neural network","online approximation capability","backstepping approach","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","minimal learning parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","backstepping","neural control","nonlinear time-delay systems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Models, Statistical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Time Factors"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive control","backstepping","neural control","nonlinear time-delay systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Perturbed Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4497309/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9992356","pubMedId":"18558537","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Control for a Class of Perturbed Strict-Feedback Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb03-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078731S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4522590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"4522590","articleId":"4497309","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4497407,"authors":[{"name":"Raghu Ramakrishnan","affiliation":["Yahoo Research, Chile"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Ramakrishnan","id":"37283169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497407","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Grid computing","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Programming profession","Web services","Strontium","Application software","Computer bugs","Electron tubes"]}],"abstract":"The infamous prediction \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,\" was allegedly made by Thomas Watson, Sr. Perhaps he was merely a little ahead of his time, if he was referring to farms of computers accessed over networks, i.e., \"computers in the clouds.\" Mainframes once dominated the computing landscape, drawing programmers from afar to submit their applications, along with burnt offerings (especially if bugs got into the vacuum tubes).

The specification of a semantically correct schema mapping is typically a complex task. Automated tools can suggest potential mappings, but few tools are available for helping a designer understand mappings and design alternative mappings. We describe Muse, a mapping design wizard that uses data examples to assist designers in understanding and refining a schema mapping towards the desired specification. We present novel algorithms behind Muse and show how Muse systematically guides the designer on two important components of a mapping design: the specification of the desired grouping semantics for sets of data and the choice among alternative interpretations for semantically ambiguous mappings. In every component, Muse infers the desired semantics based on the designer's actions on a short sequence of small examples. Whenever possible, Muse draws examples from a familiar database, thus facilitating the design process even further. We report our experience with Muse on some publicly available schemas.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497409","startPage":"10","endPage":"19","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497409.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Muse: Mapping Understanding and deSign by Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Muse: Mapping Understanding and deSign by Example","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497409/","accessionNumber":"9963792","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497409/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Muse: Mapping Understanding and deSign by Example","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071452S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4497414,"authors":[{"name":"Vijayshankar Raman","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijayshankar","lastName":"Raman","id":"37425757200"},{"name":"Garret Swart","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Garret","lastName":"Swart","id":"37282683500"},{"name":"Lin Qiao","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37426125500"},{"name":"Frederick Reiss","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Frederick","lastName":"Reiss","id":"37426627900"},{"name":"Vijay Dialani","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Dialani","id":"37829361200"},{"name":"Donald Kossmann","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Kossmann","id":"37283234900"},{"name":"Inderpal Narang","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Inderpal","lastName":"Narang","id":"37373458300"},{"name":"Richard Sidle","affiliation":["IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Sidle","id":"38131116700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497414","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":649},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Query processing","Costs","Delay","Frequency","Entropy","Databases","Hardware","Data structures","Tuning","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant-time query processing","Blink","compression scheme","hash-based aggregation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497414","abstract":"Query performance in current systems depends significantly on tuning: how well the query matches the available indexes, materialized views etc. Even in a well tuned system, there are always some queries that take much longer than others. This frustrates users who increasingly want consistent response times to ad hoc queries. We argue that query processors should instead aim for constant response times for all queries, with no assumption about tuning. We present Blink, our first attempt at this goal, that runs every query as a table scan over a fully denormalized database, with hash group-by done along the way. To make this scan efficient, Blink uses a novel compression scheme that horizontally partitions tuples by frequency, thereby compressing skewed data almost down to entropy, even while producing long runs of fixed-length, easily-parseable values. We also present a scheme for evaluating a conjunction of range and equality predicates in SIMD fashion over compressed tuples, and different schemes for efficient hash-based aggregation within the L2 cache. A experimental study with a suite of arbitrary single block SQL queries over a TPCH-like schema suggests that constant-time queries can be efficient.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","startPage":"60","endPage":"69","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497414","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497414.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant-Time Query Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497414/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Constant-Time Query Processing","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963686","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant-Time Query Processing","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058462S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497415,"authors":[{"name":"Hoyoung Jeung","affiliation":["The University of Queensland, National ICTAustralia (NICTA), Brisbane"],"firstName":"Hoyoung","lastName":"Jeung","id":"37542341200"},{"name":"Qing Liu","affiliation":["Tasmanian ICT Centre, CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37654357500"},{"name":"Heng Tao Shen","affiliation":["The University of Queensland, National ICTAustralia (NICTA), Brisbane"],"firstName":"Heng Tao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279492800"},{"name":"Xiaofang Zhou","affiliation":["The University of Queensland, National ICTAustralia (NICTA), Brisbane"],"firstName":"Xiaofang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37280490500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497415","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1659},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Trajectory","Australia","Prediction methods","Query processing","Telecommunication traffic","Databases","Motion estimation","Road vehicles","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid prediction model","moving objects databases","query processing techniques"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497415","abstract":"Existing prediction methods in moving objects databases cannot forecast locations accurately if the query time is far away from the current time. Even for near future prediction, most techniques assume the trajectory of an object's movements can be represented by some mathematical formulas of motion functions based on its recent movements. However, an object's movements are more complicated than what the mathematical formulas can represent. Prediction based on an object's trajectory patterns is a powerful way and has been investigated by several work. But their main interest is how to discover the patterns. In this paper, we present a novel prediction approach, namely The Hybrid Prediction Model, which estimates an object's future locations based on its pattern information as well as existing motion functions using the object's recent movements. Specifically, an object's trajectory patterns which have ad-hoc forms for prediction are discovered and then indexed by a novel access method for efficient query processing. In addition, two query processing techniques that can provide accurate results for both near and distant time predictive queries are presented. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed techniques are more accurate and efficient than existing forecasting schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497415","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497415.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Prediction Model for Moving Objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Prediction Model for Moving Objects","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963626","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497415/","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Prediction Model for Moving Objects","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106054S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4497422,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Gil Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jae-Gil","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538769500"},{"name":"Jiawei Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Han","id":"37276626200"},{"name":"Xiaolei Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaolei","lastName":"Li","id":"37423497900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497422","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":198,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2846},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Hurricanes","Databases","Data mining","Trajectory","Data analysis","Computer science","Phase detection","Credit cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory outlier detection","partition-and-detect framework","data mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497422","abstract":"Outlier detection has been a popular data mining task. However, there is a lack of serious study on outlier detection for trajectory data. Even worse, an existing trajectory outlier detection algorithm has limited capability to detect outlying sub- trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel partition-and-detect framework for trajectory outlier detection, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, detects outlying line segments for trajectory outliers. The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency. For the second phase, we present a hybrid of the distance-based and density-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that TRAOD correctly detects outlying sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497422.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497422","startPage":"140","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497422/","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework","htmlLink":"/document/4497422/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9963625","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10055S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4497434,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Li","id":"37278182300"},{"name":"Jiaheng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiaheng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37404386600"},{"name":"Yiming Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yiming","lastName":"Lu","id":"38129793600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497434","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":889},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497434","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","Filtering algorithms","Cleaning","Dictionaries","Computer science","Databases","Management information systems","Postal services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information filtering","merging","string matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["merging-filtering algorithm","approximate string search"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497434","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497434.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches","abstract":"We study the following problem: how to efficiently find in a collection of strings those similar to a given query string? Various similarity functions can be used, such as edit distance, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity. This problem is of great interests to a variety of applications that need a high real-time performance, such as data cleaning, query relaxation, and spellchecking. Several algorithms have been proposed based on the idea of merging inverted lists of grams generated from the strings. In this paper we make two contributions. First, we develop several algorithms that can greatly improve the performance of existing algorithms. Second, we study how to integrate existing filtering techniques with these algorithms, and show that they should be used together judiciously, since the way to do the integration can greatly affect the performance. We have conducted experiments on several real data sets to evaluate the proposed techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497434/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963623","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for Approximate String Searches","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054325S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497436,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Machanavajjhala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Machanavajjhala","id":"37397953000"},{"name":"Daniel Kifer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Kifer","id":"37397951700"},{"name":"John Abowd","affiliation":["Department of Labor Economics, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Abowd","id":"38131190300"},{"name":"Johannes Gehrke","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Gehrke","id":"37270015700"},{"name":"Lars Vilhuber","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cornell University, USA"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Vilhuber","id":"38131190600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497436","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":218,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":1413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data privacy","Computer science","Data analysis","Statistical analysis","Law","Legal factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","data privacy","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal privacy analysis","data anonymization process","synthetic data generation","mapping program","statistical inference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497436","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the first formal privacy analysis of a data anonymization process known as the synthetic data generation, a technique becoming popular in the statistics community. The target application for this work is a mapping program that shows the commuting patterns of the population of the United States. The source data for this application were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, but due to privacy constraints, they cannot be used directly by the mapping program. Instead, we generate synthetic data that statistically mimic the original data while providing privacy guarantees. We use these synthetic data as a surrogate for the original data. We find that while some existing definitions of privacy are inapplicable to our target application, others are too conservative and render the synthetic data useless since they guard against privacy breaches that are very unlikely. Moreover, the data in our target application is sparse, and none of the existing solutions are tailored to anonymize sparse data. In this paper, we propose solutions to address the above issues.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497436.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497436","startPage":"277","endPage":"286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy: Theory meets Practice on the Map","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497436/","displayDocTitle":"Privacy: Theory meets Practice on the Map","htmlLink":"/document/4497436/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9963786","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy: Theory meets Practice on the Map","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131737S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497446,"authors":[{"name":"Osman Abul","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, TOBB University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"Abul","id":"37267863300"},{"name":"Francesco Bonchi","affiliation":["Pisa KDD Laboratory, ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Bonchi","id":"37426512400"},{"name":"Mirco Nanni","affiliation":["Pisa KDD Laboratory, ISTI-CNR, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Mirco","lastName":"Nanni","id":"37669195900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497446","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":224,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1300},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497446","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Databases","Publishing","Predictive models","Data privacy","Distortion measurement","Extraterrestrial measurements","Data engineering","Laboratories","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data privacy","database management systems","greedy algorithms","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving objects database","data privacy","anonymity preserving data publishing","information preservation","space translation","NP-hard problem","greedy algorithm","ad hoc pre-processing","outlier removal technique","spatio-temporal range query","cylindrical volume","positioning system","sampling system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497446","endPage":"385","startPage":"376","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Never Walk Alone: Uncertainty for Anonymity in Moving Objects Databases","abstract":"Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem that is receiving increasing attention. According to the fc-anonymity principle, each release of data must be such that each individual is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 other individuals. In this paper we study the problem of anonymity preserving data publishing in moving objects databases. We propose a novel concept of k-anonymity based on co-localization that exploits the inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to sampling and positioning systems (e.g., GPS) imprecision, the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where its radius delta represents the possible location imprecision: we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from each other. This leads to the definition of (k,delta) -anonymity for moving objects databases. We first characterize the (k, delta)-anonymity problem and discuss techniques to solve it. Then we focus on the most promising technique by the point of view of information preservation, namely space translation. We develop a suitable measure of the information distortion introduced by space translation, and we prove that the problem of achieving (k,delta) -anonymity by space translation with minimum distortion is NP-hard. Faced with the hardness of our problem we propose a greedy algorithm based on clustering and enhanced with ad hoc pre-processing and outlier removal techniques. The resulting method, named NWA (Never Walk .Alone), is empirically evaluated in terms of data quality and efficiency. Data quality is assessed both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and by comparing the results of the same spatio-temporal range queries executed on the original database and on the (k, delta)-anonymized one. Experimental results show that for a wide range of values of delta and k, the relative error introduced is kept low, confirming that NWA produces high quality (k, delta)-anonymized data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497446/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497446/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9963733","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Never Walk Alone: Uncertainty for Anonymity in Moving Objects Databases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Never Walk Alone: Uncertainty for Anonymity in Moving Objects Databases","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099641S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":4497456,"authors":[{"name":"Junyi Xie","affiliation":["Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, CA, USA"],"affiliationProfileUrl":"/institution/profile/50301","firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37422027600"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280196200"},{"name":"Yuguo Chen","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yuguo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37635428700"},{"name":"Haixun Wang","affiliation":["Thomas J.

Many applications require information to be recovered from such data. Ideally, an approach for information recovery should have the following features. First, it should be able to incorporate prior knowledge about the data, even if such knowledge is in the form of complex distributions and constraints for which no close-form solutions exist. Second, it should be able to capture complex correlations and quantify the degree of uncertainty in the recovered data, and further support queries over such data. The database community has developed a number of approaches for information recovery, but none is general enough to offer all above features. To overcome the limitations, we take a significantly more general approach to information recovery based on sampling. We apply sequential importance sampling, a technique from statistics that works for complex distributions and dramatically outperforms naive sampling when data is constrained. We illustrate the generality and efficiency of this approach in two application scenarios: cleansing RFID data, and recovering information from published data that has been summarized and randomized for privacy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497456","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497456.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"485","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sampling-Based Approach to Information Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Sampling-Based Approach to Information Recovery","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497456/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963785","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497456/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sampling-Based Approach to Information Recovery","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069149S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4497459,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38084220200"},{"name":"Jian Pei","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Pei","id":"37276034900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497459","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":352,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":3292},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497459","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Privacy","Loss measurement","Data privacy","Knowledge engineering","Publishing","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","data privacy","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preservation","social networks","neighborhood attacks","social network data","relational data","conventional anonymization","aggregate network queries"]}],"abstract":"Recently, as more and more social network data has been published in one way or another, preserving privacy in publishing social network data becomes an important concern. With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on privacy preservation can deal with relational data only, and cannot be applied to social network data. In this paper, we take an initiative towards preserving privacy in social network data. We identify an essential type of privacy attacks: neighborhood attacks. If an adversary has some knowledge about the neighbors of a target victim and the relationship among the neighbors, the victim may be re-identified from a social network even if the victim's identity is preserved using the conventional anonymization techniques. We show that the problem is challenging, and present a practical solution to battle neighborhood attacks. The empirical study indicates that anonymized social networks generated by our method can still be used to answer aggregate network queries with high accuracy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497459","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497459","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497459.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preserving Privacy in Social Networks Against Neighborhood Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Preserving Privacy in Social Networks Against Neighborhood Attacks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963699","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497459/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preserving Privacy in Social Networks Against Neighborhood Attacks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088348S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"352","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497488,"authors":[{"name":"Song Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Lin","id":"37419831200"},{"name":"Benjamin Arai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside. barai@cs.ucr.edu"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Arai","id":"37689504000"},{"name":"Dimitrios Gunopulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside; Department of Informatics, University of Athens. dg@cs.ucr.edu"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Gunopulos","id":"37283166900"},{"name":"Gautam Das","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, USA"],"firstName":"Gautam","lastName":"Das","id":"37086392345"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497488","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497488","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Aggregates","Computer science","Power engineering and energy","Energy consumption","Partitioning algorithms","Buildings","Condition monitoring","Technical Activities Guide -TAG","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["queueing theory","sampling methods","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region sampling","continuous adaptive sampling","sensor networks","energy constraints","error bounding solutions","nonoverlapping regions","sampling energy cost rate","sampling statistics","real-world data sets"]}],"abstract":"Satisfying energy constraints while meeting performance requirements is a primary concern when a sensor network is being deployed. Many recent proposed techniques offer error bounding solutions for aggregate approximation but cannot guarantee energy spending. Inversely, our goal is to bound the energy consumption while minimizing the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, region sampling, for computing approximate aggregates while satisfying a pre-defined energy budget. Our algorithm is distinguished by segmenting a sensor network into partitions of non-overlapping regions and performing sampling and local aggregation for each region. The sampling energy cost rate and sampling statistics are collected and analyzed to predict the optimal sampling plan.

The dominance of graphs in real-world applications asks for new graph data management so that users can access graph data effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we study a graph pattern matching problem over a large data graph. The problem is to find all patterns in a large data graph that match a user-given graph pattern. We propose a new two-step R-join (reachability join) algorithm with filter step and fetch step based on a cluster- based join-index with graph codes. We consider the filter step as an R-semijoin, and propose a new optimization approach by interleaving R-joins with R-semijoins. We conducted extensive performance studies, and confirm the efficiency of our proposed new approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497500","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497500.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Graph Pattern Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast Graph Pattern Matching","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963683","htmlLink":"/document/4497500/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Graph Pattern Matching","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127343S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497502,"authors":[{"name":"Frederick Reiss","affiliation":["Almaden Research Center, IBM, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Frederick","lastName":"Reiss","id":"37426627900"},{"name":"Sriram Raghavan","affiliation":["Almaden Research Center, IBM, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"38120657800"},{"name":"Rajasekar Krishnamurthy","affiliation":["Almaden Research Center, IBM, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajasekar","lastName":"Krishnamurthy","id":"37272601800"},{"name":"Huaiyu Zhu","affiliation":["Almaden Research Center, IBM, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huaiyu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38124941600"},{"name":"Shivakumar Vaithyanathan","affiliation":["Almaden Research Center, IBM, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shivakumar","lastName":"Vaithyanathan","id":"37284922000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1836-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1837-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"4497502","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Information services","Web sites","Internet","Instruments","Scalability","Algebra","Databases","Query processing","Intelligent structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","grammars","knowledge engineering","query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic approach","rule-based information extraction","regular expression grammars","grammar-based systems","large data sets","traditional database research","query optimization","rule-based extraction programs","text-specific characteristics","real-world blog data"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497502","abstract":"Traditional approaches to rule-based information extraction (IE) have primarily been based on regular expression grammars.

In order to unleash this potential, the wealth of information available on the Web needs to be extracted and organized. There is a need for new querying techniques that are simple and yet more expressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines. Searching for knowledge rather than Web pages needs to consider inherent semantic structures like entities (person, organization, etc.) and relationships (isA, located In, etc.). In this paper, we propose NAGA, a new semantic search engine. NAGA builds on a knowledge base, which is organized as a graph with typed edges, and consists of millions of entities and relationships extracted from Web-based corpora. A graph-based query language enables the formulation of queries with additional semantic information. We introduce a novel scoring model, based on the principles of generative language models, which formalizes several notions such as confidence, informativeness and compactness and uses them to rank query results. We demonstrate NAGA's superior result quality over state-of-the-art search engines and question answering systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Search engines","Data mining","Information retrieval","Web pages","Instruction sets","Database languages","Biological system modeling","Informatics","Web sites","Cultural differences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","Internet","knowledge based systems","query languages","query processing","search engines","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NAGA","searching knowledge","ranking knowledge","World Wide Web","knowledge base","querying techniques","keyword-based search engines","Web pages","semantic search engine","Web-based corpora","graph-based query language","generative language models","state-of-the-art search engines","question answering systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497504","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497504","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497504.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497504","startPage":"953","endPage":"962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NAGA: Searching and Ranking Knowledge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NAGA: Searching and Ranking Knowledge","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497504/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497504/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963680","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NAGA: Searching and Ranking Knowledge","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065391S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497505,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanyuan Tian","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Tian","id":"38122948100"},{"name":"Jignesh M.

To fully exploit the wealth of information encoded in graphs, effective and efficient graph matching tools are critical. Due to the noisy and incomplete nature of real graph datasets, approximate, rather than exact, graph matching is required. Furthermore, many modern applications need to query large graphs, each of which has hundreds to thousands of nodes and edges. This paper presents a novel technique for approximate matching of large graph queries. We propose a novel indexing method that incorporates graph structural information in a hybrid index structure. This indexing technique achieves high pruning power and the index size scales linearly with the database size. In addition, we propose an innovative matching paradigm to query large graphs. This technique distinguishes nodes by their importance in the graph structure. The matching algorithm first matches the important nodes of a query and then progressively extends these matches. Through experiments on several real datasets, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497505","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497505","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492792/4497384/04497505.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"972","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TALE: A Tool for Approximate Large Graph Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"TALE: A Tool for Approximate Large Graph Matching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9963682","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497505/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TALE: A Tool for Approximate Large Graph Matching","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071954S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497516,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Biton","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Biton","id":"38362164100"},{"name":"Sarah Cohen-Boulakia","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud 11, Orsay, France","University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Cohen-Boulakia","id":"38307451200"},{"name":"Susan B.

Due to the large amount of data generated by these experiments and the need for reproducible results, provenance has become of paramount importance. Workflow systems are therefore starting to provide support for querying provenance. However, the amount of provenance information may be overwhelming, so there is a need for abstraction mechanisms to help users focus on the most relevant information. The technique we pursue is that of \"user views\". Since bioinformatics tasks may themselves be complex sub-workflows, a user view determines what level of sub-workflow the user can see, and thus what data and tasks are visible in provenance queries. In this paper, we formalize the notion of user views, demonstrate how they can be used in provenance queries, and give an algorithm for generating a user view based on which tasks are relevant for the user. We then describe our prototype and give performance results. Although presented in the context of scientific workflows, the technique applies to other data-oriented workflows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497516/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497516/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9963691","conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Querying and Managing Provenance through User Views in Scientific Workflows","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Querying and Managing Provenance through User Views in Scientific Workflows","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"ICDE08-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068364S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492792","isNumber":"4497384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492792","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4497384","articleId":"4497516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497520,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

Similarity joins find use in a variety of fields, such as clustering, text mining, and multimedia databases. A novel similarity join algorithm called LSS is presented that executes on a graphics processing unit (GPU), exploiting its parallelism and high data throughput. As GPUs only allow simple data operations such as the sorting and searching of arrays, LSS uses these two operations to cast a similarity join operation as a GPU sort-and-search problem. It first creates, on the fly, a set of space-filling curves on one of its input datasets, using a parallel GPU sort routine. Next, LSS processes each point p of the other dataset in parallel. For each p, it searches an interval of one of the space-filling curves guaranteed to contain all the pairs in which p participates. Using extensive theoretical and experimental analysis, LSS is shown to offer a good balance between time and work efficiency.

In particular, it supports ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR modes. The design occupies 7452 slices of a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP50, features a maximum clock speed of 56.3MHz and produces throughput up to 480.427 Mbps, 423.906 Mbps and 379.284 Mbps for 128, 192 and 256-bit keys respectively.

This serves as an error amplifier for low-drop-out (LDO) voltage regulators. The amplifier is stabilized using an AC gain boosting scheme along with RHP zero cancellation (ACBZC). An AC multipath is added to the internal stage of the conventional three stage amplifier, which improves significantly the gain-bandwidth (GBW) product without increasing the total power consumption substantially. Also, a right half plane (RHP) zero cancellation using multipath zero cancellation technique is proposed to further improve the GBW by 18%. A three stage amplifier has been designed using 90-nm CMOS process and is simulated using a 1 V power supply.

The conventional methods of SRAM stability estimation suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) using static failure criteria, such as SNM, which does not capture the transient and dynamic behavior of SRAM operation, and (2) using quasi-Monte-Carlo simulation, which approximates the failure distribution, resulting in large errors at the tails where the desired failure probabilities exist. These drawbacks are eliminated by employing a new distribution-independent, most-probable-failure-point search technique for accurate probability calculation along with accurate simulation-based dynamic failure criteria. Compared to previously published techniques, the proposed technique offers orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy. Moreover, the proposed technique enables the correct evaluation of stability in real operation conditions and for different dynamic circuit techniques, such as dynamic writeback, where the conventional methods are not applicable.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497639","publicationTitle":"2007 Internatonal Conference on Microelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Internatonal Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489831/4497639/04497685.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2007.4497685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2007.4497685","startPage":"167","endPage":"170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM dynamic stability estimation using MPFP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497685/","displayDocTitle":"SRAM dynamic stability estimation using MPFP","htmlLink":"/document/4497685/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9965446","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM dynamic stability estimation using MPFP","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-04182008-00046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065605S","chronDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489831","isNumber":"4497639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489831","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4497639","articleId":"4497685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497686,"authors":[{"name":"Sherif A.

Memory arrays are also an important source of leakage since the majority of transistors are utilized for on-chip caches in today's high performance microprocessors. Two six transistor SRAM cells based on independent-gate FinFET technology (IG-FinFET) are described in this paper for simultaneously reducing the active and standby mode power consumption while enhancing the data stability and the integration density. With the first independent-gate FinFET SRAM cell, one gate of each double-gate access and pull-up transistor is permanently disabled in order to enhance the data stability while achieving write-ability with minimum sized transistors. With the second independent-gate FinFET SRAM cell, the threshold voltages of the access transistors are dynamically adjusted during circuit operation in order to maximize the memory integration density without sacrificing the performance and stability. The read stability is enhanced by up to 92% with the IG-FinFET SRAM cells as compared to a tied- gate FinFET SRAM cell with the same size transistors in a 32 nm FinFET technology. Furthermore, with the IG-FinFET SRAM cells, the idle mode leakage power and the cell area are reduced by up to 36% and 11%, respectively, as compared to a standard tied-gate FinFET SRAM cell sized for comparable read stability in a 32 nm FinFET technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497686/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497686/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9965447","conferenceDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Independent-Gate and Tied-Gate FinFET SRAM Circuits: Design Guidelines for Reduced Area and Enhanced Stability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent-Gate and Tied-Gate FinFET SRAM Circuits: Design Guidelines for Reduced Area and Enhanced Stability","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-04182008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05637S","chronDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489831","isNumber":"4497639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489831","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4497639","articleId":"4497686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497688,"authors":[{"name":"Roula Ghannoum","affiliation":["Polystim Neurotechnologies Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Roula","lastName":"Ghannoum","id":"38131032400"},{"name":"Mohamad Sawan","affiliation":["Polystim Neurotechnologies Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Sawan","id":"37276702600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1846-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1847-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"4497688","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Image sensors","Pixel","Image converters","CMOS technology","Voltage","Circuits","Shift registers","Dynamic range","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","comparators (circuits)","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS multimode image sensor","visual cortical stimulator","digital pixel sensor","switched capacitor comparator","supply voltages","dynamic range sensor","size 90 nm","voltage 2.5 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multimode image sensor","switched-capacitor comparator","reduced area","CMOS 90nm technology","visual cortical stimulator"]}],"abstract":"We present in this paper a variable resolution multimode digital pixel sensor (DPS).

In order to simplify the encoding procedure, irregular repeat and accumulate (IRA) LDPC codes have been chosen. This paper proposes an efficient, low delay and high throughput encoder architecture shared by all DVB-S2 LDPC-IRA codes. The architecture explores the periodic structure of the adopted codes by performing on the fly partial-parallel computation of the parity check bits. The architecture implementation on a XC2VP30 Virtex2P Xilinx FPGA (@131.7 MHz) shows a minimum throughput of 5.93 Gb/s in worst case conditions.

The design utilizes 51 FF's only. It does require, at worst, 2 preamble bits to get into lock. The extracted clock is not shifted as long as input data jitter is small (typically less than \u00b112.5%UI), thus, minimizing jitter in the extracted clock. Typically, for small input data jitter, the extracted clock shows an rms jitter of 51 ps which is mainly due to the 35.6 ps jitter (rms) of the system lOOMHz-master clock. Besides, it can withstand an input data cycle-to-cycle jitter up to \u00b137.5% UI without getting out of lock. Data are obtained through digital correlation with the incoming symbol instead of ordinary sampling at the middle of the eye pattern, which improves BER. It is insensitive to long runs of transition-free data patterns. Besides, the extracted clock has a 50% duty cycle.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2007.4497715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2007.4497715","publicationTitle":"2007 Internatonal Conference on Microelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Internatonal Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4489831/4497639/04497715.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of a Fully Digital CDR for Plesiochronous Clocking Systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9965476","htmlLink":"/document/4497715/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of a Fully Digital CDR for Plesiochronous Clocking Systems","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-04182008-00076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059808S","chronDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489831","isNumber":"4497639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489831","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4497639","articleId":"4497715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497730,"authors":[{"name":"Yann Cooren","affiliation":["University of Paris XII, Creteil, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Cooren","id":"37400475300"},{"name":"Mourad Fakhfakh","affiliation":["National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Fakhfakh","id":"37284027600"},{"name":"Mourad Loulou","affiliation":["National Engineering School of Sfax (ENIS), Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Loulou","id":"37266048800"},{"name":"Patrick Siarry","affiliation":["University of Paris XII, Creteil, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Siarry","id":"37271483000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1846-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1847-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1660"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1679"}],"articleNumber":"4497730","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497730","abstract":"This brief paper deals with using the particle swarm optimization metaheuristic for optimally sizing CMOS positive second generation current conveyors (CCII+).

The proposed methods incorporate the effective use of genetic algorithms (GAs). In typical semi-custom and custom design flows, logic optimization is done at the gate level after Boolean translation of the input truth table. The final transistor netlist is then deduced from the simplified gate logic to be laid out on a chip. However transistor level optimizations after the Boolean simplification step would still not lead to the minimum number of transistors. This final optimization level is non-existent in present custom design flows. This work aims to address this need. A salient feature of the proposed technique is the bypassing of gate level representation and optimization in the VLSI design flow. We provide genetic methods to directly optimize truth table inputs using transistor level simplification. This eliminates the intermediate gate level optimization step and provides optimized transistor netlists which could be used for dynamic library cell generation for custom and semi-custom designs on the fly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4497739/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9965500","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A genetic approach to gateless custom VLSI design flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic approach to gateless custom VLSI design flow","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-04182008-00100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05308S","chronDate":"29-31 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4489831","isNumber":"4497639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4489831","xplore-issue":"4497639","articleId":"4497739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4497789,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Fagnani","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4497781/4497789/4497789-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Fagnani Laurea degree in Mathematics from the University of Pisa and Scuola Normale Superiore in 1986, PhD in Mathematics from the University of Groningen in 1991.

In some case randomness is due to the choice of a randomized network communication protocol. In other cases, randomness is simply caused by the potential unpredictability of the environment in which the distributed consensus algorithm is implemented. Conditions ensuring the convergence of these algorithms have already been proposed in the literature. As far as the rate of convergence of such algorithms, two approaches can be proposed. One is based on a mean square analysis, while a second is based on the concept of Lyapunov exponent. In this paper, by some concentration results, we prove that the mean square convergence analysis is the right approach when the number of agents is large. Differently from the existing literature, in this paper we do not stick to average preserving algorithms. Instead, we allow to reach consensus at a point which may differ from the average of the initial states. The advantage of such algorithms is that they do not require bidirectional communication among agents and thus they apply to more general contexts. Moreover, in many important contexts it is possible to prove that the displacement from the initial average tends to zero, when the number of agents goes to infinity.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2008.080506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4497781/04497789.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2008.080506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized consensus algorithms over large scale networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497789/","displayDocTitle":"Randomized consensus algorithms over large scale networks","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9943741","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497789/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized consensus algorithms over large scale networks","sourcePdf":"0408jsac634fagnani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128892S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4497781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"229","xplore-issue":"4497781","articleId":"4497789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4497790,"authors":[{"name":"Shreyas Sundaram","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4497781/4497790/4497790-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shreyas Sundaram is a doctoral student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Our scheme utilizes a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We show that this approach can be viewed as a linear dynamical system, with dynamics that are given by the weight matrix of the linear iteration, and with outputs for each node that are captured by the set of values that are available to that node at each time-step. In connected networks with time-invariant topologies, we use observability theory to show that after running the linear iteration for a finite number of time-steps with almost any choice of weight matrix, each node obtains enough information to calculate any arbitrary function of the initial node values. The problem of distributed consensus via linear iterations, where all nodes in the network calculate the same function, is treated as a special case of our approach.

Maximum degradation was found in \"semi-on\" conditions, close to the maximum of hot-electron generation which was detected with the aid of electroluminescence (EL) measurements. This suggests a contribution of hot-electron effects to device degradation, at least at moderate drain bias (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DS</sub>\n<30 V).

In contrast to existing approaches, this estimator does not rely on an adaptively estimated and thus signal-dependent a priori signal-to-noise ratio estimate. It therefore decouples the estimation of the speech presence probability from the estimation of the clean speech spectral coefficients in a speech enhancement task. Using both a fixed a priori signal-to-noise ratio and a fixed prior probability of speech presence, the proposed a posteriori speech presence probability estimator achieves probabilities close to zero for speech absence and probabilities close to one for speech presence. While state-of-the-art speech presence probability estimators use adaptive prior probabilities and signal-to-noise ratio estimates, we argue that these quantities should reflect true a priori information that shall not depend on the observed signal. We present a detection theoretic framework for determining the fixed a priori signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed estimator is conceptually simple and yields a better tradeoff between speech distortion and noise leakage than state-of-the-art estimators.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">A Posteriori</emphasis> Speech Presence Probability Estimation Based on a Likelihood Ratio With Fixed Priors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.921764","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4544815/04497832.pdf","startPage":"910","endPage":"919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.921764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4544815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Improved <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">A Posteriori</emphasis> Speech Presence Probability Estimation Based on a Likelihood Ratio With Fixed Priors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4497832/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10076280","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">A Posteriori</emphasis> Speech Presence Probability Estimation Based on a Likelihood Ratio With Fixed Priors","sourcePdf":"16tasl05-gerkmann.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130398S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4544815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4544815","articleId":"4497832","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497834,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Yu","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4544815/4497834/4497834-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Yu (M'97\u2013SM'06) received the B.S. degree (with honors) in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, the M.S. degree (with a presidential award) in electrical engineering from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, the M.S. degree in computer science from Indiana University, Bloomington, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Idaho, Moscow.","He joined Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, in 1998 and the Microsoft Speech Research Group in 2002, where he is currently a Researcher.

Distinguishing from the log-MMSE spectral amplitude noise suppressor proposed by Ephraim and Malah (E&M), our new algorithm is aimed to minimize the error expressed explicitly for the Mel-frequency cepstra instead of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spectra, and it operates on the Mel-frequency filter bank's output. As a consequence, the statistics used to estimate the suppression factor become vastly different from those used in the E&M log-MMSE suppressor. Our algorithm is significantly more efficient than the E&M's log-MMSE suppressor since the number of the channels in the Mel-frequency filter bank is much smaller (23 in our case) than the number of bins (256) in DFT. We have conducted extensive speech recognition experiments on the standard Aurora-3 task. The experimental results demonstrate a reduction of the recognition word error rate by 48% over the standard ICSLP02 baseline, 26% over the cepstral mean normalization baseline, and 13% over the popular E&M's log-MMSE noise suppressor. The experiments also show that our new algorithm performs slightly better than the ETSI advanced front end (AFE) on the well-matched and mid-mismatched settings, and has 8% and 10% fewer errors than our earlier SPLICE (stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments) system on these settings, respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise robustness","Speech recognition","Cepstral analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Filter bank","Noise level","Statistics","Error analysis","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","channel bank filters","discrete Fourier transforms","Fourier transform spectra","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","piecewise linear techniques","signal denoising","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust speech recognition","nonlinear feature-domain noise suppression algorithm","spectral amplitude noise suppressor","Mel-frequency cepstra","discrete Fourier transform spectra","filter banks output","word error rate","cepstral mean normalization baseline","minimum-mean-square-error optimization criterion","stereo-based piecewise linear compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)","minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate","noise reduction","phase asynchrony","robust automatic speech recognition (ASR)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4544815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.921761","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4544815/04497834.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.921761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Speech Recognition Using a Cepstral Minimum-Mean-Square-Error-Motivated Noise Suppressor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Speech Recognition Using a Cepstral Minimum-Mean-Square-Error-Motivated Noise Suppressor","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10076293","publicationDate":"July 2008","volume":"16","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497834/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Speech Recognition Using a Cepstral Minimum-Mean-Square-Error-Motivated Noise Suppressor","sourcePdf":"16tasl05-yu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109774S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4544815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4544815","articleId":"4497834","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4497843,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Dehmollaian","affiliation":["Radiation Laboratory, Department of ElectricalEngineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4524010/4497843/4497843-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mojtaba Dehmollaian (S'04) was born in Iran, in 1978.

The propagation through building walls, such as brick and poured concrete in response to point sources near the walls, is simulated by using high-frequency methods. Reciprocity is used to find the responses of point targets behind walls, which are then used to simulate the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging through the walls. The effect of building walls on the target-image distortions is investigated by simulations and measurements. It is shown that by using the idea of match filtering, the effect of the wall can be compensated for, and the point target response can be reconstructed, provided that the wall parameters are known. An optimization method based on minimization of squared error in the SAR image domain within an area confined within the expected point-spread function is used to estimate the wall parameters and sharpen the image simultaneously. A controlled experiment within the laboratory environment is performed to verify the methods presented. It is shown that for an ultrawideband system operating over a frequency band of 1-3 GHz, highly distorted images of two point targets in close proximity of each other behind a wall can be resolved after refocusing. A dual-frequency synthetic method is also presented that can improve the cross-range resolution of the refocused image.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.916212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4524010/04497843.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.916212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4524010","startPage":"1589","endPage":"1599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refocusing Through Building Walls Using Synthetic Aperture Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Refocusing Through Building Walls Using Synthetic Aperture Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10002955","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4497843/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refocusing Through Building Walls Using Synthetic Aperture Radar","sourcePdf":"46tgrs06-dehmollaian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053353S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4524010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"4524010","articleId":"4497843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497847,"authors":[{"name":"Bazil Taha Ahmed","affiliation":["Escuela Politecnica Superior, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4527042/4497847/4497847-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bazil Taha Ahmed was born in Mosul, Iraq, in 1960.

The (UMTS and CDMA- 450 systems) normalized range and normalized capacity degradation are evaluated. A free-space propagation model is used to calculate the UWB signal power that interferes with both mobile systems. It is shown that, for the case of a single UWB transmitter, the UMTS can easily tolerate UWB interference when the UWB equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) is -92.5 dBm/MHz or less for a distance between the UWB transmitter and the UMTS mobile of 1 m or higher. Also, it is shown that, for the case of multi-UWB transmitters, the UMTS can easily tolerate the UWB interference when the UWB EIRP is -94.5 dBm/MHz. For the single UWB transmitter case, the CDMA-450 downlink can tolerate UWB interference when the UWB power density is in the order of -106 dBm/MHz. For the case of multi-UWB transmitters, the power density that can be tolerated by the downlink of the CDMA- 450 system is in the order of -108 dBm/MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4527042/04497847.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.919033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.919033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4527042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Impact of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) on Macrocell Downlink of UMTS and CDMA-450 Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["3G mobile communication","Interference","Receivers","Noise","Mobile communication","Multiaccess communication","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","code division multiple access","radio links","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband emission","macrocell downlink","UMTS","CDMA-450 system","Universal Mobile Telecommunication System","code division multiple access system","free-space propagation model","UWB interference tolerance","UWB equivalent isotropically radiated power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code division multiple access systems (CDMA-450)","macrocell normalized capacity","macrocell normalized range","ultra-wideband (UWB)","universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS)"]},{"kwd":["Code division multiple access systems (CDMA-450)","macrocell normalized capacity","macrocell normalized range","ultra-wideband (UWB)","universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Impact of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) on Macrocell Downlink of UMTS and CDMA-450 Systems","volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4497847/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10002918","dateOfInsertion":"20 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Impact of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) on Macrocell Downlink of UMTS and CDMA-450 Systems","sourcePdf":"50temc02-ahmed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050622S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4527042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4527042","articleId":"4497847","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497848,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4550662/4497848/4497848-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Wu (S\u201989\u2013M\u201992\u2013SM\u201999\u2013F\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 1993.","From 1992 to 1993, he was with Rockwell Automation as a Senior Engineer.

Here, we present a generalized approach based on a hierarchical tensor (multilinear) space representation for hallucinating high-resolution face images across multiple modalities, achieving generalization to variations in expression and pose. In particular, we formulate a unified tensor which can be reduced to two parts: a global image-based tensor for modeling the mappings among different facial modalities, and a local patch-based multiresolution tensor for incorporating high-resolution image details. For realistic hallucination of unregistered low-resolution faces contained in raw images, we develop an automatic face alignment algorithm capable of pixel-wise alignment by iteratively warping the probing face to its projection in the space of training face images. Our experiments show not only performance superiority over existing benchmark face super-resolution techniques on single modal face hallucination, but also novelty of our approach in coping with multimodal hallucination and its robustness in automatic alignment under practical imaging conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4515964/04497872.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.922421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.922421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4515964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Face Super-Resolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Image resolution","Lighting","Image generation","Face","Humans","Image reconstruction","Probes","Iterative algorithms","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","image resolution","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning-based face image super-resolution","hierarchical tensor space representation","global image-based tensor","local patch-based multiresolution tensor","automatic face alignment algorithm","pixel-wise alignment","iterative warping","single modal realistic face hallucination","multimodal hallucination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face hallucination","super-resolution","tensor"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Face","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Face Super-Resolution","volume":"17","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4497872/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9966241","pubMedId":"18482883","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Face Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"17tip06-jia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155426S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4515964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4515964","articleId":"4497872","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497881,"authors":[{"name":"Rubens M.

An estimation technique based on delay differential inequality with variable coefficients is developed to establish delay-independent/delay-dependent sufficient conditions for global asymptotic/exponential stability. The stability criteria obtained are based on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-matrix theory. These criteria can be easily checked in practice and do not require that the delays be constant or differentiable. In particular, our delay-independent asymptotic/exponential stability criteria remove a restriction on the amplification functions imposed by the existing results. Furthermore, our delay-dependent exponential stability criteria give explicitly the allowable upper bound on the diagonal delays such that the global stability property of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks can be retained. Thus, our new results are of great importance in design and application of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with variable delays. The effectiveness of the new results is further illustrated by two numerical examples in comparison with the existing results.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.924114","startPage":"3145","endPage":"3159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.924114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04497921.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Global Asymptotic Stability of Cohen\u2013Grossberg Neural Networks With Variable Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497921/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Global Asymptotic Stability of Cohen\u2013Grossberg Neural Networks With Variable Delays","volume":"55","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4497921/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10346642","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 April 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Global Asymptotic Stability of Cohen\u2013Grossberg Neural Networks With Variable Delays","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209715S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4497921","onlineDate":"25 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":4497922,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4684845/4497922/4497922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuan-Hung Chen was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1976.

The results show that the adaptive transmit/receive structures perform satisfactorily in comparison to their non-adaptive counterparts, the loss being in the order of 2-3 dB's for customary values of the system parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492760/4497949/04497974.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2007.4497974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2007.4497974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497949","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Transmit/Receive Schemes for Mimo Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar cross section","Radar clutter","Receiving antennas","Radar detection","Radar antennas","Covariance matrix","Transmitting antennas","Availability","Spaceborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive radar","correlation methods","MIMO systems","radar clutter","radar detection","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive transmit/receive scheme","MIMO radar","radar clutter correlation","constant-false-alarm rate","adaptive waveform selection procedure","radar detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO Radar","Adaptive Processing","Space-Time Coding","Clutter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Transmit/Receive Schemes for Mimo Radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497974/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9967741","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Transmit/Receive Schemes for Mimo Radar","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"CAMSAP-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051298S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492760","isNumber":"4497949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492760","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4497949","articleId":"4497974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4497975,"authors":[{"name":"P.F.

The compressive sensing approach is developed as a recent alternative to the solution of a broad class of target parameter estimation problems. Our research program emphasizes certain inverse source and scattering problems, for which one has a priori knowledge on sparsity of the sources, scatterers and their fields, in physically- derived representational dictionaries for those signals.

In this paper we investigate antenna selection for fourth-generation OFDMA- based cellular communications systems, in particular, 3GPP LTE (long-term evolution) systems. We propose a training method for antenna selection that is especially suitable for OFDMA. By means of simulation, we evaluate the SNR-gain that can be achieved with our design. We find that the performance depends on the bandwidth assigned to each user, the scheduling method (round-robin or frequency-domain scheduling), and the Doppler spread. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio of the training sequence plays a critical role. Typical SNR gains are around 2 dB, with larger values obtainable in certain circumstances.","doi":"10.1109/CAMSAP.2007.4497978","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492760/4497949/04497978.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2007.4497978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection Training in MIMO-OFDM/OFDMA Cellular Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4497978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497978/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection Training in MIMO-OFDM/OFDMA Cellular Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9967779","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4497978/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection Training in MIMO-OFDM/OFDMA Cellular Systems","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"CAMSAP-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064416S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492760","isNumber":"4497949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492760","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4497949","articleId":"4497978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4497980,"authors":[{"name":"R. von Borries","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, El Paso, El Paso, TX, USA"],"firstName":"R.","lastName":"von Borries","id":"37285014400"},{"name":"C.

In this paper, we show that the amount of samples which must be taken from a signal with sparse Discrete-time Fourier Transform (DFT) can be reduced compared to the original compressed sensing approach if information on the support of the sparse domain can be employed. More precisely, the required number of samples in time domain is reduced by exactly the amount of known frequencies associated to non-zero coefficients.

With channel state information at the transmitter, it is possible to tailor transmissions by selective beamforming towards specific user groups, thereby harnessing the wireless 'broadcast advantage' and managing co-channel interference. Wireless (physical layer) multicasting options are currently being debated in the emerging UMTS-LTE standard. A key problem in this context is admission control: it is often infeasible or impractical to serve all subscribers from a single access point, due to mutual interference or power limitations. This paper considers the joint multicast beamforming and admission control problem, aiming to maximize the number of subscribers that can be served and minimize the power required to serve them. The joint problem is NP-hard, yet suitable reformulation reveals that it can be naturally relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP), leading to an approximation by deflation over SDP. Experimental results using measured channels indicate that the proposed approximation approach is fast and efficient.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMSAP.2007.4497997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4497949","startPage":"189","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492760/4497949/04497997.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Multicast Beamforming and Admission Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4497997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4497997/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Multicast Beamforming and Admission Control","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9967736","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Multicast Beamforming and Admission Control","confLoc":"St. Thomas, VI, USA","sourcePdf":"CAMSAP-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045842S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492760","isNumber":"4497949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492760","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4497949","articleId":"4497997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4497998,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Hui Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Hui","lastName":"Chang","id":"37405141700"},{"name":"Zhi-Quan Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi-Quan","lastName":"Luo","id":"38184211700"},{"name":"Chong-Yung Chi","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chong-Yung","lastName":"Chi","id":"37267801400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1713-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1714-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4497998","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Broadcasting","Polynomials","Transmitting antennas","Quality of service","Receiving antennas","Frequency","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcasting","computational complexity","minimax techniques","multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semidefinite relaxation","max-min-fair multicast transmit beamforming","multigroup broadcasting","NP-hard problem","polynomial time approximation approach","transmit antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmit beamforming","broadcasting","semidef-inite relaxation","approximation bound"]}],"abstract":"The max-min-fair transmit beamforming problem in multigroup broadcasting has been shown to be NP-hard in general.

Sensors exchange local messages to reach consensus on the transmitted message. Different from recent distributed detectors where the amount of information exchanges increases exponentially with the alphabet size (i.e., the number of hypotheses tested), the novel consensus-based approach introduced here relies on semi-definite relaxation techniques and can afford inter-sensor exchanges of polynomial order. The resultant near-optimum convexified problem is solved in a distributed fashion using the alternating direction method of multipliers. No constraint is imposed on the network topology so long as it remains fully connected.

The transmit and receive correlation matrices are assumed to be available at the transmitter, while the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unknown. The proposed precoder minimizes the upper bound on the symbol error rate (SER). Our main contribution consists of developing a convex formulation for originally non-convex problem of SER minimization for precoder design.

Due to the modeling limitation of HVDC control loops in small signal stability analysis, previous works on similar projects of CSG strongly depended on trial and error method, which tests each set of controller parameters with time-domain simulation to observe how the controllers work. The paper induces a novel HVDC modulation model compatible with NEVA. Using the linearized system model and a hybrid stochastic nonlinear optimization algorithm, combined with genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm, a strong nonlinear modal interaction phenomenon which is so called `modal resonance' is avoided. Furthermore, the parameters of the three HVDC modulation controllers are optimized simultaneously. Time domain simulations with NETOMAC validate the efficiency of the coordinated control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PESAFR.2007.4498050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESAFR.2007.4498050","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society Conference and Exposition in Africa - PowerAfrica","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492962/4498028/04498050.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society Conference and Exposition in Africa - PowerAfrica","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Control of Multiple HVDC systems for damping interarea oscillations in CSG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Control of Multiple HVDC systems for damping interarea oscillations in CSG","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4498050/","accessionNumber":"10040921","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498050/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Control of Multiple HVDC systems for damping interarea oscillations in CSG","confLoc":"Johannesburg, South Africa","sourcePdf":"PESAFR-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056983S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492962","isNumber":"4498028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492962","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4498028","articleId":"4498050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4498082,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Based on the weak buses identification method, the first developed algorithm introduces a new feature extraction technique. The second and third algorithms are based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) respectively which are statistical methods. These algorithms offer beneficial solutions for neural network training speed enhancement. In all presented algorithms, a clustering method is applied to reduce the number of neural network training vectors.

Finding defensive islands of large scale power systems is a combinatorial explosion problem. Thus, it is very difficult to find an optimal solution, if it exists, within reasonable time using analytical methods. This paper proposes utilizing the computational efficiency property of an angle modulated particle swarm optimization to find some efficient islanding solutions for large scale power systems. The solutions are referred to as optimal according to a fitness function considering the real power balance between generations and loads in islands, the relative importance of customers, and the desired number of islands. The algorithm can also provide necessary load shedding information. Furthermore, the algorithm can provide a number of candidate solutions for the check of transmission system capacity constraint. Simulations with power systems of different scales demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PESAFR.2007.4498114","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society Conference and Exposition in Africa - PowerAfrica","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492962/4498028/04498114.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society Conference and Exposition in Africa - PowerAfrica","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESAFR.2007.4498114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization Based Defensive Islanding of Large Scale Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Large-scale systems","Power systems","Power system simulation","Power system stability","Power system protection","Power system dynamics","Power system interconnection","Power system transients","Power system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","load shedding","particle swarm optimisation","power system faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angle modulated particle swarm optimization","defensive islanding","large scale power systems","catastrophic wide area blackouts","North American blackout","AD 2003","combinatorial explosion problem","real power balance","load shedding information","transmission system capacity constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization Based Defensive Islanding of Large Scale Power Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4498114/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2008","conferenceDate":"16-20 July 2007","accessionNumber":"10040982","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization Based Defensive Islanding of Large Scale Power Systems","confLoc":"Johannesburg, South Africa","sourcePdf":"PESAFR-00-86.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068583S","chronDate":"16-20 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4492962","isNumber":"4498028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492962","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4498028","articleId":"4498114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4498210,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["Sch. of Comput., Nat.

Identifying traffic anomalies rapidly and accurately is critical to network stability and usefulness. Most papers focus on analyzing the volume of data or packets on the network. However, legitimate network traffic may be bursty or highly variable, rendering such naive approaches ineffective (Lakhina et al., 2005). We propose a novel method called MultiA to solve this problem. Rather than just looking at volumes of packets, MultiA intelligently adopted multistage filter and information entropy take into account the behavior of the network. The MultiA is scalable, automated and self-training.

In recent work we have modeled the behavior of H.263 videoconference traces with the use of a discrete autoregressive (DAR(1)) model. Based on this model, we then proposed an efficient CAC scheme for videoconference traffic over cellular networks, which uses precomputed traffic scenarios for its decision-making and which was shown to clearly excel in comparison with well-known existing approaches, in terms of quality of service (QoS) provisioning to users receiving videoconference traffic. In this paper, we continue our work by enhancing and further studying our scheme for the case of \"unknown users\" attempting to enter the network and for the case of providing call admission control to web users as well as videoconference ones.","doi":"10.1109/ICN.2008.17","publicationTitle":"Seventh International Conference on Networking (icn 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh International Conference on Networking (icn 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4498125/4498126/04498240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICN.2008.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498126","startPage":"675","endPage":"680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Efficient Call Admission Control for Wireless Multimedia Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4498240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Highly Efficient Call Admission Control for Wireless Multimedia Traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498240/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-18 April 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9962624","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4498240/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Efficient Call Admission Control for Wireless Multimedia Traffic","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3106a675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066755S","chronDate":"13-18 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4498125","isNumber":"4498126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4498125","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4498126","articleId":"4498240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4498258,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Matsukawa","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Matsukawa","id":"37275006700"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Endo","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Endo","id":"37288899200"},{"name":"Yongxun Liu","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yongxun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279411800"},{"name":"Shinichi O'uchi","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"O'uchi","id":"37299257100"},{"name":"Yuki Ishikawa","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37292335200"},{"name":"Hiromi Yamauchi","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromi","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37275497200"},{"name":"Junichi Tsukada","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Tsukada","id":"37408006000"},{"name":"Kenichi Ishii","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Ishii","id":"37277195200"},{"name":"Meishoku Masahara","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Meishoku","lastName":"Masahara","id":"37275479100"},{"name":"Kunihiro Sakamoto","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kunihiro","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37275161600"},{"name":"Eiichi Suzuki","affiliation":["Nanoelectronics Research Institute, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiichi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37275493800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4498258","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"A Ta/Mo interdiffusion dual metal gate technology was successfully introduced to FinFET fabrication.

In this paper we propose a novel method in order to improve concurrency of particular kind of transaction, known as long running transactions. Differently from other techniques presented in the literature, we design a sort of hybrid approach between optimistic and pessimistic concurrency models. From one hand, our basic idea consists of handling frequent disconnections or inactivity periods of a generic transaction during its life-cycle and, from the other one, we consider the semantics related to operations produced by transactions. First, our solution avoids an indefinite or long resource locking due to disconnecting (or idle) transactions or a high rate of preventive aborts; eventually, a transaction \"semantic compatibility\" is exploited in order to increase the concurrency reconcilable operations on the same resources. To these purposes, we have implemented a middleware with the aims of emulating a transactional scheduling, and several experiments have been carried out.","doi":"10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498304","endPage":"136","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492761/4498260/04498304.pdf","startPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-serialization of long running transactions to improve concurrency in mobile environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 April 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498304/","displayDocTitle":"Pre-serialization of long running transactions to improve concurrency in mobile environments","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9979305","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4498304/","publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-serialization of long running transactions to improve concurrency in mobile environments","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-04222008-00044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056469S","chronDate":"7-12 April 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4492761","isNumber":"4498260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4492761","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4498260","articleId":"4498304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4498370,"authors":[{"name":"Kerstin Denecke","affiliation":["Research Center L3S, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Kerstin","lastName":"Denecke","id":"37592348100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2161-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2162-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4498370","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":141,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2688},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Motion pictures","Software standards","Testing","Natural language processing","Machine learning algorithms","Humans","Data mining","Information services","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["language translation","natural language processing","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SentiWordNet","multilingual sentiment analysis","lexical resources","English","standard translation software","sentiment classification","German movie","document polarity","text polarity","Amazon","statistical polarity classifier","n-grams"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498370","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4498370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498260","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 24th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4492761/4498260/04498370.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using SentiWordNet for multilingual sentiment analysis","abstract":"This paper introduces a methodology for determining polarity of text within a multilingual framework.

For sentiment classification, a document is searched for sentiment bearing words like adjectives. By means of SentiWordNet, scores for positivity and negativity are determined for these words. An interpretation of the scores then leads to the document polarity. The method is tested for German movie reviews selected from Amazon and is compared to a statistical polarity classifier based on n-grams.

The basic principle of the FI-UCSA is to transform the received signals to the phase mode and remove the frequency dependency of individual phase modes through a digital beamforming network. Hence, the far-field pattern of the array is determined by a set of weights. Thanks to the FI characteristic, traditional narrowband adaptive beamforming algorithms such as minimum variance beamforming and the generalized sidelobe canceller method can be applied to the FI-UCSA. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive FI-UCSA beamformer achieves a lower steady-state error and converges faster than the conventional tapped-delay line approach while requiring fewer adaptive coefficients. A new broadband 2-D DOA estimation algorithm using ESPRIT techniques for FI-UCSA is proposed to recursively estimate the DOAs of the moving targets. Simulation results show that the proposed DOA estimation algorithm achieves a satisfactory performance for slowly varying sources at low arithmetic complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","volume":"55","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"10346645","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4498388/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming and Recursive DOA Estimation Using Frequency-Invariant Uniform Concentric Spherical Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beamforming and Recursive DOA Estimation Using Frequency-Invariant Uniform Concentric Spherical Arrays","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-chen4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094582S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4498388","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4498390,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Grebennikov","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4684845/4498390/4498390-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrei Grebennikov (M'99\u2013SM'04) received the Dipl.

The ideal collector voltage and current waveforms demonstrate a possibility of 100% efficiency without overlapping between each other. A possibility of alternative load network implementation including a series quarterwave transmission line or lumped-element approximation is also considered. The switched-mode Class-FE power amplifiers with a quarterwave transmission line offer a new challenge for RF and microwave power amplification providing high-efficiency operation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.924123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4684845/04498390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.924123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4684845","startPage":"3284","endPage":"3292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Class-FE Tuned Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4498390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Class-FE Tuned Power Amplifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10346644","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4498390/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Class-FE Tuned Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tcsi10-grebennikov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075812S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4684845","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4684845","articleId":"4498390","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4498393,"authors":[{"name":"Shinichi Aozasa","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4542899/4498393/4498393-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shinichi Aozasa was born in Tochigi, Japan, on October 22, 1971.

In order to maintain the quality of signal and control over network in the transparent domains, optical performance monitoring (OPM) systems are becoming a necessity. Phase modulation formats emerge as the solution of choice in transparent domains because of their sensitivity, spectral efficiency, and resilience to optical impairments. In this paper, we demonstrate a flexible OPM method for phase-modulated signals using asynchronous amplitude histogram analysis. We show numerically and experimentally the monitoring of optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), chromatic dispersion (CD), and polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) for differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) signals. The OSNR can be measured within range of 20-35 dB and accumulated chromatic dispersion between 600 and 600 ps/nm. The asynchronous amplitude histogram monitoring method is proved to be a precise and versatile monitoring tool for high-capacity optical networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.917374","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4542899/04498394.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4542899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.917374","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Performance Monitoring of Phase-Modulated Signals Using Asynchronous Amplitude Histogram Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4498394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optical Performance Monitoring of Phase-Modulated Signals Using Asynchronous Amplitude Histogram Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498394/","volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4498394/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10058726","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Performance Monitoring of Phase-Modulated Signals Using Asynchronous Amplitude Histogram Analysis","sourcePdf":"26jlt10-bartlomiej.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055827S","chronDate":"May15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4542899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4542899","articleId":"4498394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4498395,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad A.

We consider two network architectures: local sources (LS) at each optical network unit (ONU) versus a single source located at the central office. We examine both architectures over a 20-km optical link, as well as a reference back-to-back configuration. Our architectures can adopt two-feeder and single-feeder topologies; however, we only test the two-feeder topology and therefore the effect of Rayleigh backscattering is neglected. We also study the relative merits (cost and performance) of local sources versus centralized architectures. A penalty of less than 2 dB between the LS and the centralized light sources (CLS) architectures was measured at a bit error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n under certain assumptions on the relative power of the sources. The power budget in the CLS architectures is more critical than in the LS architectures; extra splitting and propagation losses exist as the uplink travels through the network back and forth. Doubling the number of users while maintaining the same distance and source power in LS architectures imposes 3-dB additional losses, whereas for CLS architectures, there are 6-dB extra losses. CLS architectures can overcome these penalties using amplification at the central office. Alternately, central office amplification can be used to more than double the number of users in LS SAC-OCDMA PONs. A standalone (no global clock) burst-mode receiver with clock and data recovery (CDR), clock and phase alignment (CPA), and Reed-Solomon RS(255,239) forward-error correction (FEC) decoder is demonstrated. A penalty of less than 0.25 dB due to the nonideal sampling of the CDR is reported. The receiver also provides an instantaneous phase acquisition time for any phase step between consecutive packets, and a good immunity to silence periods. A coding gain of more than 2.5 dB was reported for a single-user system, and BER floors were completely eliminated.

We use a spatial light modulator (SLM) to shape the spatial profile of light launched into an MMF. We derive an expression for the system impulse response in terms of the SLM reflectance and the field patterns of the MMF principal modes (PMs). Finding optimal SLM settings to minimize ISI, subject to physical constraints, is posed as an optimization problem. We observe that our problem can be cast as a second-order cone program, which is a convex optimization problem. Its global solution can, therefore, be found with minimal computational complexity, and can be implemented using fast, low-complexity adaptive algorithms. We include simulation results, which show that this technique opens up an eye pattern originally closed due to ISI. We also see that, contrary to what one might expect, the optimal SLM settings do not completely suppress higher order PMs.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.917324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.917324","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1303","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4542899/04498396.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4542899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of Multimode Fiber Dispersion Using Adaptive Optics via Convex Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2008","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of Multimode Fiber Dispersion Using Adaptive Optics via Convex Optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2008","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2008","volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4498396/","accessionNumber":"10058734","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498396/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of Multimode Fiber Dispersion Using Adaptive Optics via Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"26jlt10-panicker.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091761S","chronDate":"May15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4542899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4542899","articleId":"4498396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4498429,"authors":[{"name":"Catarina Brites","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u0151es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4639430/4498429/4498429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Catarina Brites received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Universidade T\u00e9cnica de Lisboa, Portugal, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","She is also a Researcher with the Image Group, Telecommunications Institute, IST.

Most of the solutions available in the literature model the correlation noise (CN) between the original frame and its estimation made at the decoder, which is the so-called side information (SI), by a given distribution whose relevant parameters are estimated using an offline process, assuming that the SI is available at the encoder or the originals are available at the decoder. The major goal of this paper is to propose a more realistic WZ video coding approach by performing online estimation of the CN model parameters at the decoder, for pixel and transform domain WZ video codecs. In this context, several new techniques are proposed based on metrics which explore the temporal correlation between frames with different levels of granularity. For pixel-domain WZ (PDWZ) video coding, three levels of granularity are proposed: frame, block, and pixel levels. For transform-domain WZ (TDWZ) video coding, DCT bands and coefficients are the two granularity levels proposed. The higher the estimation granularity is, the better the rate-distortion performance is since the deeper the adaptation of the decoding process is to the video statistical characteristics, which means that the pixel and coefficient levels are the best performing for PDWZ and TDWZ solutions, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.924107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4639430/04498429.pdf","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.924107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4639430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Noise Modeling for Efficient Pixel and Transform Domain Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4498429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4498429/","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Noise Modeling for Efficient Pixel and Transform Domain Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Coding","volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10236672","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4498429/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Noise Modeling for Efficient Pixel and Transform Domain Wyner\u2013Ziv Video Coding","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt09-brites.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112868S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4639430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"181","xplore-issue":"4639430","articleId":"4498429","onlineDate":"30 April 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4498432,"authors":[{"name":"Yanwei Pang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yanwei","lastName":"Pang","id":"37416619900"},{"name":"Yuan Yuan","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37401230700"},{"name":"Xuelong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Systems, Birkbeck College, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xuelong","lastName":"Li","id":"37293192200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4498432","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":185,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1479},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction","Linear discriminant analysis","Humans","Kernel","Object detection","Scattering","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","face recognition","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gabor-based region covariance matrices","face recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","face recognition","Gabor","region covariance matrix (RCM)"]},{"kwd":["Region covariance matrix","Gabor","Biometrics","Face recognition"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new method for human face recognition by utilizing Gabor-based region covariance matrices as face descriptors.

The reason is basically statistical. For small volumes of oil, such as test cups, statistical variations are large and unit dielectric strengths are high. For large volumes at high spacings, such as in large power equipment, lower unit dielectric strengths must be recognized, but statistical reliability and reproducibility are greatly improved. In calculations, statistical extrapolations can be eliminated by computing an equivalent volume of oil under stress and obtaining the dielectric strength from test data on a sphere gap with the same equivalent volume. Ignoring everything but the change in dielectric strength with volume, the calculation method checks the fundamental curves in Peek's 1915 empirical data with surprisingly good accuracy. Included are changes in dielectric strength with: 1. the radii of spheres, 2. the separation of spheres, and 3. the changed geometry from spheres to cylinders.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04498604.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

III, June 1953, pp. 562-71], the authors presented the results of a study of the performance of two interconnected steam-electric power-generating areas as affected by frequency and tie-line power controllers. The present paper extends this study to include hydroelectric power generating areas as well. As before, the object is to determine theoretically the best values of controller gains, that is, to find those controller settings that will result in best over-all system performance. The principal criterion of good performance is, also as before, the minimizing of any oscillations in tie-line power or system frequency resulting from load disturbances to either area. Thus, stability, rather than rapidity of response, is preferred, since the system actually is continually being disturbed by small and more or less random changes of load, rather than by the step load change used as a test disturbance in the study.","doi":"10.1109/AIEEPAS.1954.4498803","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04498803.png","startPage":"133","endPage":"146","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

Included in this paper are analyses of general configuration, generated voltage and frequency, magnetic circuit, generator losses, and materials. A design procedure which employs the use of a set of empirically derived constants which determine various mechanical and electrical parameters is presented. The design charts can be used for flux-switch alternators ranging in power from 100 to 5,000 watts and for shaft speeds from 10,000 to 50,000 rpm. A sample design based on the use of the design charts is developed for a 50,000-rpm 3-kw 250-volt single-phase flux-switch alternator with permanent magnet excitation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Principles of Flux-Switch Alternators [includes discussion]","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.
