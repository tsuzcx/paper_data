The speech quality is the major factor to be evaluated. Based on speech recognition and speaker recognition, the speech quality should be evaluated by an established evaluation center. Based on a standard speech quality, the required carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I)/sub s/ of each tested system can be found. Then, according to (C/I)/sub s/ and the channel bandwidth, the radio capacity can be obtained. Based on the radio capacity, an evaluation method is introduced to evaluate the spectrum efficiency among all the tested systems. Evaluations for different types of environments are described, and the selection process is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3463147","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluate digital cellular systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluate digital cellular systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05409S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"4","articleId":"40040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":40042,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The diversity antennas for the over-the-shoulder telephone are described. Location optimization yields an average correlation coefficient of 0.25 and an average gain of -2.9 dBd in carrying. Next, the diversity antennas for the handheld telephone are presented. Experimental results show that even a 0.1-wavelength separation provides an average correlation coefficient of less than 0.5.

The authors present three short-block equalization techniques based on linear, nonlinear decision-directed, and maximum-likelihood estimation principles. Short alternating blocks of data and training symbols are used. In contrast to the recursive symbol-by-symbol equalization approaches usually employed, each data block is detected as a unit. These schemes require an estimate of the channel impulse response. This is considered an advantage from the adaptation point of view, since channel response estimation is one of the simplest adaptation requirements of any equalization process. Performance is evaluated for QPSK (quadrature phase-shift keying) and BPSK (binary phase-shift keying) signaling using a Rayleigh fading-channel model with severe time-dispersion. The degradation from ideal for the three schemes was about 5, 2.5, and 1 dB respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040063.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-block equalization techniques employing channel estimation for fading time-dispersive channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Decision feedback equalizers","Maximum likelihood estimation","Matched filters","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Intersymbol interference","Pulse modulation","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio systems","equalisers","fading","phase shift keying","radiocommunication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear estimation","nonlinear decision directed estimation","QPSK","radiocommunication","channel estimation","time-dispersive channels","digital communications","fading channels","short-block equalization techniques","maximum-likelihood estimation","training symbols","channel impulse response","quadrature phase-shift keying","BPSK","binary phase-shift keying","Rayleigh fading-channel model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Short-block equalization techniques employing channel estimation for fading time-dispersive channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463168","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-block equalization techniques employing channel estimation for fading time-dispersive channels","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037836S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"11","articleId":"40063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40064,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.M.

The transmitter employs quadrature-quadrature phase-shift keying (Q/sup 2/PSK) which is a relatively new spectrally efficient modulation scheme and can be considered as two minimum-shift-keying type signalling schemes in parallel.

Measurements were made at 11 GHz with a fixed-site antenna located at the side of the road at heights of up to 30 ft. Data have been taken with both omnidirectional and directional antennas on the mobile, to compare received signal characteristics. It was found that, in rural and semiurban environments, propagation is dominated by interference between the direct ray and a specular, roadway-reflected ray. The average power received does not decay any faster than 1/r/sup 2/ over the measured range of transmitter-to-receiver separation. A wideband communication channel looks feasible, since the dual-ray interference effects and the random components of the received signals can be overcome by simple methods such as higher antenna directivity or space diversity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40095","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040095.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","startPage":"316","endPage":"320 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation measurements at microwave frequencies for microcellular mobile and personal communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Propagation measurements at microwave frequencies for microcellular mobile and personal communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40095/","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463199","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation measurements at microwave frequencies for microcellular mobile and personal communications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051895S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"5","articleId":"40095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":40099,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

A multiple-beam adaptive base-station antenna is proposed as a major system component in an attempt to solve this problem. The approach is demonstrated by employing an antenna array to resolve the angular distribution of the mobile users as seen at the base-station site, and then using this information to direct beams towards the mobiles in both transmit and receive modes. The energy associated with each mobile is thus confined within the addressed volume, greatly reducing the number of co-channel cells. For a given performance criterion, this results in an increase in the spectral efficiency or capacity of the network. The concept is demonstrated using results generated by a computer simulation of a simplified mobile scenario. The realization of a fully adaptive base-station antenna test rig is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040099.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40099","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","startPage":"341","endPage":"348 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-beam adaptive base-station antennas for cellular land mobile radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Multi-beam adaptive base-station antennas for cellular land mobile radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40099/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463203","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-beam adaptive base-station antennas for cellular land mobile radio systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040075S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"17","articleId":"40099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":40102,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

The single coherent receiver input is switched between two uncorrelated Rayleigh-fading signals and the one with higher power is selected. The experimental radio link uses time-division multiplexing with a coherent receiver. Since the down-link transmitter is always on the received signal measurements and selection can be performed just before the reception of the user's data burst. The measured performance compares favorably with computer simulation. The effect of delay between measurement/selection and the actual data burst demodulation is also presented. It is found from both experiment and computer simulation that selection diversity is effective in reducing the bit-error-rate floor caused by frequency-selective fading. As a result, a higher data rate can be supported by a multipath fading channel without using adaptive equalization. Thus, a low-complexity hardware design incorporating selection diversity is feasible for a portable radio communication system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40114","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040114.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"463 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured performance of 4-QAM with 2-branch selection diversity in frequency-selective fading using only one receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40114/","displayDocTitle":"Measured performance of 4-QAM with 2-branch selection diversity in frequency-selective fading using only one receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463218","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured performance of 4-QAM with 2-branch selection diversity in frequency-selective fading using only one receiver","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046162S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"12","articleId":"40114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40119,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Starting from such a TFLF and from the power delay profiles specified by CEPT/GSM, the simulation model provides independent realizations of the mobile radio channel transfer function. Particular attention is also devoted to the model calibration. Finally, an example of performance analysis is shown, considering a typical communication channel of the CEPT/GSM system using a reduced-complexity Viterbi adaptive equalizer, based on a modified Viterbi algorithm, and with timing and carrier phase recovery and channel impulse response estimation performed by utilizing the 26-bit 'midamble' sequence foreseen by the TDMA (time-division multiple-access) channel burst format.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040138.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"639 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40138","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40138","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40138","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["GSM","Power system modeling","Land mobile radio","Transfer functions","Viterbi algorithm","Europe","Frequency","Nonlinear filters","Radiofrequency identification","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","digital radio systems","mobile radio systems","radiowave propagation","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","time dependent linear filter","narrowband mobile radio","cellular radio","simulation","propagation characteristics","modelling","pan-European digital mobile radio system","CEPT/GSM","frequency-dependent linear filter","transfer functions","short-term random propagation","reduced-complexity Viterbi adaptive equalizer","modified Viterbi algorithm","carrier phase recovery","channel impulse response estimation","TDMA","time-division multiple-access","900 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40138/","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and simulation of the propagation characteristics of the 900 MHz narrowband-TDMA CEPT/GSM mobile radio","accessionNumber":"3463241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and simulation of the propagation characteristics of the 900 MHz narrowband-TDMA CEPT/GSM mobile radio","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042403S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"5","articleId":"40138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":40139,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The optimum parameters for 16QAM with a transmission rate of 16 k symbol/s, the BER (bit error rate) performance, and the interference performance are determined by computer simulation. It is shown that second-order interpolation is suitable for the fading compensation method. In the case of 16 k-symbol/s transmission, the optimum frame length is 16 symbols. The degradation due to the proposed fading compensation method is about 2 dB. The BER performance under Rayleigh fading environments at f/sub d/<100 Hz is in good agreement with the theoretical value. The BER performance degradation of the implemented 16QAM modem from the simulated results is only about 1 dB. These results confirm that a 16QAM modem using the proposed method can be applied to land mobile communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40139","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040139.pdf","startPage":"640","endPage":"646 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rayleigh fading compensation method for 16QAM in digital land mobile radio channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Rayleigh fading compensation method for 16QAM in digital land mobile radio channels","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463242","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rayleigh fading compensation method for 16QAM in digital land mobile radio channels","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055898S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"92","articleId":"40139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":40143,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The effect of code interleaving and channel measurement information on word-error probability is analyzed. To account for the correlated errors in the transmitted bit sequence, the channel state is modelled using the discrete Gilbert-Elliot model. The word-error probability plots provide useful insight into the significance of interleaving degree and channel-state information (CSI) for the code performance in a portable radio. It was demonstrated that at low signal/noise ratios, as is typical of the Rayleigh fading channel, the use of CSI at the decoder with both coherent and partially coherent schemes offers finite coding gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40143/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3463246","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coding methods for portable radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding methods for portable radios","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026177S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"2","articleId":"40143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40146,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Weldon (IEEE Trans. on Comm., vol.COM-30, p.480-486, March 1982) for use in systems with limited receiver buffer is studied. Unlike Weldon's scheme in which all erroneous data packets are discarded, the present schemes make use of copies of the data packet which may contain errors. A number of channel models are considered, namely a binary symmetric channel and a nonfading and a Rayleigh fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise. In all cases, it is found that the throughput can be substantially increased. Under poor channel conditions, the use of forward error correction can lead to further improvement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","startPage":"677","endPage":"681 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040146.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient ARQ system for mobile communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Mobile communication","Welding","Decoding","Throughput","Transmitters","Rayleigh channels","Additive white noise","Forward error correction","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonfading channel","ARQ system","mobile communications","automatic repeat request","limited receiver buffer","data packet","channel models","binary symmetric channel","Rayleigh fading channel","additive white Gaussian noise","throughput","forward error correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"An efficient ARQ system for mobile communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40146/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3463249","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient ARQ system for mobile communications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022748S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"3","articleId":"40146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40150,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This technique is described in its conceptual form, and compared with steered antenna array configurations currently favored for this class communication system. The proposed system uses established diversity combining techniques previously developed for mobile terrestrial radio. It is suggested that a diversity-based receiver architecture would allow the coherent recombination of the multipath signal energy present at the mobile terminal site, and thereby enhance system performance for a given link budget. The cophasing of the multipath signals can be implemented using a FFSR (feedforward signal regeneration) signal-processing architecture, which uses the presence of a pilot-tone within the communications channel. On transmit, a retrodirective beam is formed towards the active satellite. The economic viability of such a transceiver is also considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40157","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","startPage":"749","endPage":"756 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A diversity combining antenna array for land mobile satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A diversity combining antenna array for land mobile satellite communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40157/","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463258","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A diversity combining antenna array for land mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047747S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"3","articleId":"40157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40160,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A parallel acquisition scheme is applied to make up for the effect of the fading environment on key parameters such as the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm, and the mean acquisition time. An expression for the mean acquisition time is derived in terms of detection, false alarm, and missing probabilities. These probability expressions are derived in both a nonfading and fast-fading AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channels, and the mean acquisition time is shown for nonfading, slow-fading, and fast-fading channels. It is shown that in a nonfading channel, the designer should choose the MF (matched filter) length as large as practically possible and then cover the rest of the uncertainty region with parallel MFs. The same applies for the slow-fading channel. In fast-fading channels the contrary is the right choice; for better performance the designer needs to increase parallelism at the cost of MF length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct sequence spread spectrum parallel acquisition in a fading mobile channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040161.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"779 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Direct sequence spread spectrum parallel acquisition in a fading mobile channel","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463262","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct sequence spread spectrum parallel acquisition in a fading mobile channel","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027276S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"14","articleId":"40161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40162,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

This technique is called the spread-spectrum pilot technique (SSPT). Incorporated into this technique are elements of both tone-calibrated techniques and spread-spectrum systems. In the SSPT system, the desired pilot tone is modulated by a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) generator of finite duration and then linearly added to the source (customer) date that are actually being sent. At the receiver, the same finite PRBS sequence is used to decode the received signal. The system works because it provides an accurate version of the actual data carrier to be used in demodulation of the received signal. It is strongly believed that this type of system will enable better performance in multipath fading environments that are especially problematic in mobile-radio applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1989.40162","publicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 39th Vehicular Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/832/1551/00040162.pdf","startPage":"780","endPage":"787 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1989.40162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spread spectrum based system technique for synchronization of digital mobile communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40162/","displayDocTitle":"A spread spectrum based system technique for synchronization of digital mobile communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463263","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spread spectrum based system technique for synchronization of digital mobile communication systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055512S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","articleId":"40162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":40163,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

The subscriber's address is chosen by a 4-bit binary code which in turn selects the address signal to be generated.

Log-normal spatial distributions and uniform distributions of users over the coverage area are compared.

Under the assumption that multipath signal amplitudes are jointly log-normally distributed over local areas and excess delay, the application of second-order statistics (correlation) is presented. In addition, the distributions of received power within a particular excess delay interval are found for both global and local areas. It is shown that the log-normal distribution describes the fading of multipath components over local areas for particular excess delays. Moreover, individual multipath signal strengths are log-normal about a mean power law of the form d/sup n/. The log-normal distribution is attractive for modeling the impulse response amplitudes because correlation data are easily incorporated. Conditional probabilities of path occupancy are presented which show the effect power control will have on indoor radio systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40179/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3463279","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of second-order statistics for an indoor radio channel model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of second-order statistics for an indoor radio channel model","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00040179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036618S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"832","citationCount":"12","articleId":"40179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":40197,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

An aircraft-missile computer simulation program is used to gather the data used in the neural network learning phase as well as in construction of the look-up table. The inputs to the neural model are variables such as aircraft velocity and initial range. Outputs are several maneuvers and associated maneuver times which provide the best chance for survival. Results show that a polynomial network can be generated that performs calculations approximating a simulator approximately a million times faster for the case of determining whether a aircraft needs to respond to a missile attack. Computer experiments suggest that for simple decision cases any of the three approaches are likely to be adequate: run a simulator in realtime, use a look-up table of precomputed runs, or use a polynomial network to approximate the simulator computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1989.40284","startPage":"682","endPage":"687 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/837/1552/00040284.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.1989.40284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial neural networks for airborne applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Neural networks","Missiles","Table lookup","Aircraft manufacture","Aerospace electronics","Application software","Computer science","Supervised learning","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aerospace simulation","aircraft instrumentation","learning systems","military computing","missiles","neural nets","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive unsupervised learning model","aerospace computing","airborne applications","polynomial neural network","optimal maneuvers","missile evasion","dynamical systems","aircraft-missile computer simulation program","aircraft velocity","initial range"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial neural networks for airborne applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-26 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3505984","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial neural networks for airborne applications","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00040284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029239S","chronDate":"22-26 May 1989","isNumber":"1552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"837","citationCount":"1","articleId":"40284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":40286,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

When operating as engine starter, the motor produces torque to spin the engine up to its light-off speed. Following light-off, the motor continues to produce torque to assist the engine in accelerating to idle speed. When the engine is running, the machine generates electrical power to supply engine and vehicle loads up to a peak operating speed of 50000 r/min.

It is a problem to obtain a customized object representation in three-dimensional space. The proposed system can synthesize various images dynamically from the geometric model description by handling the solid modeler. The depth information is extracted from a single view with geometric knowledge. the configuration of the target object is treated as a hypothesis.

Without spectral filtering, periodic pulse evolutions reminiscent of higher-order solitons are observed. The pulses differ from the classic solitons because of additional shaping mechanisms. With spectral filtering, pulses are generated that can be described analytically as true asymmetric N=2 solitons. The introduction of the filter appears to simplify the intracavity shaping mechanisms in such a way that the nonlinear Schrodinger equation becomes a good approximation for pulse generation in the laser.

This method has the advantages of being single-shot, of discriminating between a shift and an absorption strength change, and of separating the contribution of a single narrow line from the other spectral components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/1556/00040635.pdf","startPage":"2505","endPage":"2515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.40635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.40635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics and Fourier transform studies of the excitonic optical Stark effect","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Stark effect","Optical pumping","Semiconductor lasers","Laser theory","Optical pulses","Pump lasers","Laser beams","Laser excitation","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["excitons","Fourier transform spectra","gallium arsenide","high-speed optical techniques","III-V semiconductors","infrared spectra of inorganic solids","Stark effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminating measurement method","III-V semiconductor","single-shot measurement methods","Fourier transform studies","excitonic optical Stark effect","optical Stark effect","bulk gallium arsenide","high-repetition-rate","femtosecond laser pulses","quasi-permanent","nonadiabatic","dynamics measurement","absorption spectra","single-shot","absorption strength change","single narrow line","spectral components","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics and Fourier transform studies of the excitonic optical Stark effect","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594283","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics and Fourier transform studies of the excitonic optical Stark effect","sourcePdf":"00040635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076562S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"24","articleId":"40635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":40636,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Spectral hole burning is observed, which is accompanied by an induced absorption feature on the high-energy side. The spectral position of the burned hole depends on the excitation wavelength. For excitation on the low-energy side of the lowest quantum-confined transition, a slight shift of the hole towards the line center is observed. The hole width increases with pump intensity and the magnitude of the induced transparency saturates at the highest excitation level. The results are consistently explained by bleaching of one-pair states and induced absorption caused by the photoexcited two electron-hole pair states. It is concluded that the presence of one electron in the excited state prevents further absorption of photons at the pair-transition energy and accounts for the major portion of the bleaching of the transition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.40636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/1556/00040636.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.40636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1556","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond optical nonlinearities of CdSe quantum dots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond optical nonlinearities of CdSe quantum dots","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594284","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond optical nonlinearities of CdSe quantum dots","sourcePdf":"00040636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.290748S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"146","articleId":"40636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":40646,"authors":[{"name":"W.H.

Gain compression (measured in decibels) is shown to depend linearly on output pulse energy, with a slope that is characterized by a saturation energy. The authors present measurements of gain compression in the three regimes of repetition rates. A very low repetition rate (200 kHz) is the single-pulse injection regime, 500 MHz to 2 GHz is the regime where the pulse period is comparable to the gain recovery time in the amplifier under test, and 3-6 GHz is the regime where the pulse period is smaller than the gain recovery time. In all cases, the measurements confirm the gain compression characteristics predicted by the model. They show that a short gain recovery time results in an increased output power for a given acceptable level of gain compression, as well as an increased gain level for a given output power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606509","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Repetition-rate dependence of gain compression in InGaAsP optical amplifiers using picosecond optical pulses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetition-rate dependence of gain compression in InGaAsP optical amplifiers using picosecond optical pulses","sourcePdf":"00040649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039979S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"25","articleId":"40649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":40651,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

Important classes of Markov-type models, their properties, and their relationship are described. Although some new results are given, the authors mainly present a systematic study and grouping of processes according to two fundamental Markov-type properties: strict-sense Markov, defined in terms of conditional probabilities, and wide-sense Markov, defined in terms of linear minimum-mean-square error estimates. Classes of models having special cases of the fundamental properties, including many models which are widely used to represent images are obtained by specifying the index set, the conditioning set used to define the Markov property, and the process distribution. The relationships between unilateral and bilateral models in each class are carefully investigated. Particular attention is given to simultaneous autoregressive models which are shown to be both strict-sense and wide-sense Markov. Classification of processes according to their Markov-type properties helps to clarify the consequences of and relationships between different model assumptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1557/00040665.pdf","startPage":"1485","endPage":"1510","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.40665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.40665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-index Markov-type random processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random processes","Signal processing","Statistics","State estimation","Markov random fields","Information theory","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-index Markov-type random processes","unilateral models","two-dimensional processes","strict-sense Markov","wide-sense Markov","linear minimum-mean-square error estimates","images","index set","conditioning set","process distribution","bilateral models","simultaneous autoregressive models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-index Markov-type random processes","volume":"77","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3575296","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-index Markov-type random processes","sourcePdf":"00040665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043439S","chronDate":"Oct.  1989","isNumber":"1557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"111","articleId":"40665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":40669,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

The size of the image of the target is assumed to be small, i.e. around 10 pixels. The statistical characterization of the centroid of the target is obtained. Similarly, the statistical properties of the image correlation of two frames, which measures the target offset, are derived. Explicit expressions that map the video noise statistics into measurement noise statistics are obtained. The offset measurement noise is shown to be autocorrelated. State variable models for tracking the target centroid with these measurements are then presented. Simulation results and quantitative conclusions about achievable subpixel tracking accuracy are given.

The following techniques for improving this accuracy are discussed: the handling of the auto solid angle element Omega /sup ii/, the overall refinement of the level of discreteness, the use of a locally refined discrete grid, the isolated problem approach, and an adaptive refined computation of the discrete surface integrals involved in the BE method. The effects of these techniques on the numerical accuracy of the computed electrical potentials are illustrated by taking a volume conductor consisting of four concentric spheres representing the head since for this model an analytical (exact) solution is available. The techniques are of importance for numerically computed electroencephalograms (EEGs) since the numerically computed surface EEGs are severely affected by the relatively low conductivity of the compartment representing the skull.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1989","volume":"36","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"3561633","pubMedId":"2793196","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the numerical accuracy of the boundary element method (EEG application)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the numerical accuracy of the boundary element method (EEG application)","sourcePdf":"00040805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041686S","chronDate":"Oct.  1989","isNumber":"1563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"216","articleId":"40805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":40812,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

After a discussion of the functional device concept, resonant-tunneling bipolar transistors (RTBTs) with a double barrier in the base region are described.

RTBTs using thermionic injection and exhibiting a high peak-to-valley ratio at room temperature in the transfer characteristics are also described. Multiple-state RTBTs and their DC and microwave performance are then discussed. Circuit applications of RTBTs also are discussed. It is shown that RTBTs allow the implementation of many analog and digital circuit functions with a greatly reduced number of transistors and show considerable promise for multiple-valued logic. Experimental results on frequency multipliers and parity bit generators are presented. Analog-to-digital converters are memory circuits are also discussed. Two novel superlattice-base transistors are reported. Negative transconductance is achieved by suppression of injection into minibands.

This value of f/sub t/ corresponds to a total delay of approximately 1.0 ps and is attributed to the optimization of layer structure, device layout, and fabrication process. It is shown that the electron transit time in these very short gate-length devices still accounts for approximately 60% of the total delay, and, as a result, significant improvements in switching speed are possible with further reductions of gate length. The results reported clearly demonstrate the potential of the pseudomorphic AlGaAs/InGaAs MODFET as an ultrahigh-speed device.

The two-port under test is driven with a sinusoidal microwave signal strong enough to force it into nonlinear operation. Its output harmonics are measured in the frequency domain with a setup that includes a vector network analyzer. For phase calibration at the harmonic frequencies, a millimeter-wave Schottky diode is used as a reference device. The system allows the measurement of harmonics with a phase accuracy of about +or-10 degrees at 20 GHz (referred to f/sub 1/=5 GHz). It can be built for any frequency (<40 GHz) at which a vector network analyzer and a suitable signal generator with multiplier are available. For low-amplitude harmonics, higher sensitivity compared to time-domain measurements with a sampling scope results in better measurement accuracy. The accuracy should improve further if the nonideality of the diode reference circuit is characterized more precisely.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.40993","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1571/00040993.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.40993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"1506","endPage":"1511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of magnitude and phase of harmonics generated in nonlinear microwave two-ports","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of magnitude and phase of harmonics generated in nonlinear microwave two-ports","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40993/","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3582046","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of magnitude and phase of harmonics generated in nonlinear microwave two-ports","sourcePdf":"00040993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026592S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"74","articleId":"40993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":40998,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

In this method, the radial variations of the field components in the resonator are expressed in terms of first-degree finite-element polynomials, whereas the axial variations of the field components are approximated by trigonometric functions. To calculate the resonant frequencies, an H-vector variational formulation is employed and minimized with respect to the coefficients of the expanded field components. Spurious solutions which are inherent in the finite-element technique are effectively eliminated by means of a penalty term included in the variational expression, imposing a divergence-free magnetic field constraint. To show the capability of the method, resonant frequencies of several cylindrical cavities, including those loaded with dielectric rods and dielectric rings, were calculated. A mode chart is presented which can be used for designing certain multimode dielectric-loaded cavity filters. In contrast to other rigorous techniques reported in the literature, the present method is highly efficient when dielectrics are fully extended along the cavity length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.40998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1571/00040998.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.40998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1571","startPage":"1536","endPage":"1541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate determination of modes in dielectric-loaded cylindrical cavities using a one-dimensional finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=40998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate determination of modes in dielectric-loaded cylindrical cavities using a one-dimensional finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/40998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3582051","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate determination of modes in dielectric-loaded cylindrical cavities using a one-dimensional finite element method","sourcePdf":"00040998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03954S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"24","articleId":"40998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":41011,"authors":[{"name":"J.T.

Their optimum solution is compared with two other solutions, namely a closed-form solution which optimizes the power in one linear polarization of the radiated field, and a solution based on the popular conjugate-field scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1571/00041011.pdf","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.41011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.41011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=41011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain optimization of a near-field focusing array for hyperthermia applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperthermia","Microwave antenna arrays","Polarization","Symmetric matrices","Electromagnetic heating","Biological tissues","Electromagnetic scattering","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Closed-form solution","Near-field radiation pattern"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","antenna theory","biothermics","electromagnetic wave polarisation","focusing","microwave antenna arrays","optimisation","radiation therapy","radiofrequency heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF heating","E-plane patterns","biothermics","patient treatment","near-field focusing array","hyperthermia applications","gain optimization","microwave arrays","biological tissue","power deposition","optimum excitation","eigenvalue problem","closed-form solution","one linear polarization","radiated field","conjugate-field scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Gain optimization of a near-field focusing array for hyperthermia applications","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3582064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain optimization of a near-field focusing array for hyperthermia applications","sourcePdf":"00041011.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040818S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"40","articleId":"41011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":41015,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method is straightforwardly derived from the first-order Maxwell curl equations and comprises both the transversal and longitudinal components of the electric and magnetic fields. Hence, all necessary boundary conditions on the tangential field components are a priori satisfied by the trial functions. With this formulation, an absence of spurious modes has been found. Furthermore, by imposing the additional boundary conditions on the normal components of the magnetic induction and electric displacement fields, the dimension of the resulting matrix equation can be significantly reduced. For the fundamental modes, both the convergence order and the accuracy of the presented method are found to be significantly higher than those of comparable methods when applied to some numerical examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41035/","volume":"37","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3582071","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"A numerically efficient finite-element formulation for the general waveguide problem without spurious modes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A numerically efficient finite-element formulation for the general waveguide problem without spurious modes","sourcePdf":"00041035.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027019S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"51","articleId":"41035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":41154,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

On the assumption of the availability of a set of independent samples from Class A envelope distribution, the asymptotic performances of several estimation procedures are explored. From this analysis, estimates based on the method of moments are seen to be consistent and computationally desirable but highly inefficient, whereas more efficient likelihood-based estimators are seen to be computationally unwieldy. However, an estimator that initiates likelihood iteration with the method-of-moments estimates is seen to overcome these difficulties in its asymptotic performance. Unfortunately, simulation of this third estimator for practical sample sizes reveals poor performance under these conditions. To overcome this lack of small-sample efficiency, a similar estimator that initiates likelihood iteration with physically motivated (but nonoptimal) estimates is also proposed. Simulation of this latter estimator for practical sample sizes indicates that near-optimal performance is attained by this technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.41159","startPage":"1042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1574/00041159.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.41159","endPage":"1051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation for Middleton Class A interference processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41159/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation for Middleton Class A interference processes","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3561829","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation for Middleton Class A interference processes","sourcePdf":"00041159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040005S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"60","articleId":"41159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":41160,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

An improved Gaussian approximation to the probability of data bit error is performed. Packet performance is analyzed by using the theory of moment spaces to gain insight into the effect of bit-to-bit error dependence caused by interfering signal relative delays and phases which are assumed constant over the duration of a desired packet. Numerical results show that if no error control exists in the desired packet or if block error control is used when multiple-access interference is high, the error dependence increases the average probability of packet success beyond that predicted by models which use independent bit errors. However, when block error control is used and the multiple-access interference is low, the bit error dependencies cause a reduction in packet error performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.41160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.41160","endPage":"1061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1574/00041160.pdf","startPage":"1052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-to-bit error dependence in slotted DS/SSMA packet systems with random signature sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41160/","displayDocTitle":"Bit-to-bit error dependence in slotted DS/SSMA packet systems with random signature sequences","volume":"37","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"3561830","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-to-bit error dependence in slotted DS/SSMA packet systems with random signature sequences","sourcePdf":"00041160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033774S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"309","articleId":"41160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":41161,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

The usual optimization criterion of the loop parameters using linearized analysis is insufficient, due to coexisting periodic orbits. A new optimization procedure is presented which is based on numerical bifurcation studies. The authors obtain an analytical estimate of average lock time based on the rate of contraction of the phase space in a neighborhood of the fixed point and the size of the phase space that is regular for the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics. The analytical estimate is verified by numerical calculations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.41161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1574/00041161.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.41161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1574","startPage":"1062","endPage":"1070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear dynamics of a digital phase locked loop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=41161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear dynamics of a digital phase locked loop","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3561831","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear dynamics of a digital phase locked loop","sourcePdf":"00041161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039339S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","articleId":"41161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":41190,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The class of systems considered retains the basic structure of the Hopfield model but is easier to analyze, synthesize, and implement. An efficient analysis method is developed which can be used to determine completely the set of asymptotically stable equilibrium points and the set of unstable equilibrium points. The latter set can be used to estimate the domains of attraction for the elements of the former set. The class of systems considered can easily be implemented in analog integrated circuits.

A relative frequency range of only 6.12% was sufficient to regulate the DC output voltage at 20 V for load resistances ranging from 55 Omega to infinity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DC-DC power converters","Inverters","Frequency","Resonance","Zero current switching","Rectifiers","Electrical resistance measurement","Power measurement","Power generation","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","power convertors","rectifying circuits","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class E zero-voltage-switching inverter","class E zero-current-switching rectifier","DC/DC power converter","efficiency","full load","output power","load resistances","82.64 percent","7.3 W","20 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/31.41309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1579/00041309.pdf","startPage":"1485","endPage":"1488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.41309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC/DC converter with class E zero-voltage-switching inverter and class E zero-current-switching rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=41309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DC/DC converter with class E zero-voltage-switching inverter and class E zero-current-switching rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41309/","volume":"36","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3582670","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC/DC converter with class E zero-voltage-switching inverter and class E zero-current-switching rectifier","sourcePdf":"00041309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059667S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"25","articleId":"41309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":41326,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Its principle is based on the interpretation of a triplet of any image lines as the perspective projection of a triplet of linear ridges of the object model, and on the search for the model attitude consistent with these projections. The geometrical transformations to be applied to the model to bring it into the corresponding location are obtained by the resolution of an eight-degree equation in the general case. Using simple logical rules, it is shown on examples related to polyhedra that this approach leads to results useful for both location and recognition of 3D objects because few admissible hypotheses are retained from the interpolation of the three line segments. Line matching by the prediction-verification procedure is thus less complex.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.41365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.41365","endPage":"1278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1583/00041365.pdf","startPage":"1265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of the attitude of 3D objects from a single perspective view","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41365/","displayDocTitle":"Determination of the attitude of 3D objects from a single perspective view","volume":"11","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"3572675","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of the attitude of 3D objects from a single perspective view","sourcePdf":"00041365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035468S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"314","articleId":"41365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":41380,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An algorithm that exploits the constraint imposed by active motion of the camera is described. Within this framework, in order to facilitate measurement of the navigation parameters, a constrained egomotion strategy was adopted in which the position of the fixation point is stabilized during the navigation (in an anthropomorphic fashion). This constraint reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space without increasing the complexity of the equations. A further distinctive point is the use of two sampling rates: the faster (related to the computation of the instantaneous optical flow) is fast enough to allow the local operator to sense the passing edge (or, in other words, to allow the tracking of moving contour points), while the slower (used to perform the triangulation procedure necessary to derive depth) is slow enough to provide a sufficiently large baseline for triangulation.

By encoding images into multiple narrow spatial frequency and orientation channels, the slowly varying channel envelopes (amplitude and phase) are used to segregate textural regions of different spatial frequency, orientation, or phase characteristics. Thus, an interpretation of image texture as a region code, or carrier of region information, is emphasized. The channel filters used, known as the two-dimensional Gabor functions, are useful for these purposes in several senses: they have tunable orientation and radial frequency bandwidths and tunable center frequencies, and they optimally achieve joint resolution in space and in spatial frequency. By comparing the channel amplitude responses, one can detect boundaries between textures. Locating large variations in the channel phase responses allows discontinuities in the texture phase to be detected. Examples are given of both types of texture processing using a variety of real and synthetic textures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00041384.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1584/00041384.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.41384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.41384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=41384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel texture analysis using localized spatial filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial filters","Surface texture","Image texture analysis","Frequency","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Image texture","Demodulation","Layout","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","filtering and prediction theory","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","multichannel texture analysis","localized spatial filters","visible textures","irradiance patterns","encoding","region code","region information","two-dimensional Gabor functions","tunable orientation","radial frequency bandwidths","tunable center frequencies","joint resolution","channel amplitude responses","discontinuities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel texture analysis using localized spatial filters","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3606841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel texture analysis using localized spatial filters","sourcePdf":"00041384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048422S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"964","articleId":"41384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":41386,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To facilitate design of processors that use fully asynchronous components, the first step is to design hazard-free asynchronous interconnection circuits. To this end, a deterministic algorithm was developed to synthesize asynchronous interconnection circuits from high-level specifications. This approach systematically designs correct asynchronous interconnection circuits with the weakest possible constraints and minimal overhead. The authors are primarily concerned with the synthesis of nonmetastable circuits, even though the procedure is also valid of metastable circuit synthesis. The synthesized logic is hazard-free and guaranteed to have the fastest operation according to a behavioral specification. A high-level description is used to specify circuit behavior, not only for a simpler input format, but also as a basis for determining the final optimum designs. Automatic synthesis and the ability to localize the timing considerations reduce design effort when systems become complex.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.41504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.41504","endPage":"1205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1591/00041504.pdf","startPage":"1185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic synthesis of asynchronous circuits from high-level specifications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41504/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic synthesis of asynchronous circuits from high-level specifications","volume":"8","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"3580173","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic synthesis of asynchronous circuits from high-level specifications","sourcePdf":"00041504.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063563S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"131","articleId":"41504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":41613,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Measurements of gain in a fiber Raman amplifier show a saturation at low gain levels. Experimental data and a theoretical model are presented, demonstrating that this saturation is due to pump depletion by SBS. This effect also leads to Raman gain fluctuations arising from mode partitioning in a multimode pump laser. Two ways to avoid the deleterious effects of SBS on the performance of Raman amplifiers are suggested. One is to use a multimode semiconductor laser with a modal linewidth of the order of a few hundred megahertz, which leads to a strongly reduced Brillouin gain coefficient.

Consequently, a given low error rate may be maintained at significantly smaller signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio values than Gaussian statistics would predict. This effect is particularly prominent at the large S/N values at which digital communication systems usually operate. The theory of PIIN is briefly described, including a quantitative treatment of the photocurrent S/N bit-error-rate (BER) relationship in systems where both PIIN and thermal noise exist. A technique that enables the measurement of the S/N-BER relationship well into the tails of the noise-photocurrent distribution, where ordinary histogramming techniques fail due to insufficient resolving power, is also described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.41629","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1596/00041629.pdf","startPage":"2055","endPage":"2058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.41629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependence of error rate on signal-to-noise ratio in fiber-optic communication systems with phase-induced intensity noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=41629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41629/","displayDocTitle":"Dependence of error rate on signal-to-noise ratio in fiber-optic communication systems with phase-induced intensity noise","volume":"7","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605070","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependence of error rate on signal-to-noise ratio in fiber-optic communication systems with phase-induced intensity noise","sourcePdf":"00041629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029011S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"29","articleId":"41629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":41635,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This experiment demonstrates the potential of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers for application in wavelength-division-multiplexed communication systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.41635","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1596/00041635.pdf","startPage":"2095","endPage":"2104","doi":"10.1109/50.41635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain saturation effects in high-speed, multichannel erbium-doped fiber amplifiers at lambda =1.53 mu m","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Gain saturation effects in high-speed, multichannel erbium-doped fiber amplifiers at lambda =1.53 mu m","volume":"7","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605076","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain saturation effects in high-speed, multichannel erbium-doped fiber amplifiers at lambda =1.53 mu m","sourcePdf":"00041635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067038S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"129","articleId":"41635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":41661,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

When data do not help refine these membership sets, the effort of updating the parameter estimates at those points can be avoided. An intuitive development is given, first in one dimension and then in the general case, of an SM algorithm based on least-squares estimation. Two useful versions of the method are described, one of which can be implemented on a systolic array processor. The relationship of the featured SM method to both historical and current developments is discussed.

The proposed technique uses analytical information from simple models (such as a generation reliability model) as regression variables to reduce the variance of LOLP (loss-of-load probability) and EPNS (expected power not supplied) estimates with the complete (composite) model. Sample size reductions of up to two orders of magnitude were obtained in case studies with a 24 bus modified reliability test system and a 124 bus reduced Brazilian system. Speed-ups of 6.1 to more than 40 were obtained for the estimate of the EPNS and of 2.1 to 3.8 for the LOLP estimate. In all cases, the EPNS index required more samplings to converge to the required tolerance (5% relative uncertainty) than the respective LOLP index (for the same tolerance). As a consequence, the higher speedups prevail in the overall convergence if a uniform criterion is adopted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41680/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3563290","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","displayDocTitle":"A technique for reducing computational effort in Monte-Carlo based composite reliability evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for reducing computational effort in Monte-Carlo based composite reliability evaluation","sourcePdf":"00041680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026593S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"56","articleId":"41680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":41682,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This capacity value provides an equitable means of allocating the cost of transmission facilities among users of the firm transmission service. Through examples, it is shown that this methodology, called the MW-mile methodology, is more reflective of the actual usage of the transmission network in allocating the transmission network capacity cost than the now widely used postage stamp rate procedure.

The inclusion of a constraint for a unit or for a system-wide margin (e.g. spinning reserve) is shown. The procedure is fast, in part because the simplex tableau is not explicitly stored. The method is shown in pseudo-code. This method is very suitable for real-time economic dispatch on any energy management system.

This approach has the capability of taking into account the following effects: coupling of cascaded multichannel reservoirs, water time delays, reservoir head variations, load flow, and other constraints due to security and environmental considerations. The problem is decomposed into hydro and thermal subproblems which are then solved iteratively. An effective adjustment has been proposed to take into account the nonlinear relation between the two subproblems to speed up the convergence of the iterative process. In this adjustment, as well as in solving the thermal subproblem, equations of coordination and OPF are combined for better computational efficiency. On the basis of the proposed approach, four different methods, which differ in the degree of details in modeling the thermal system, have been tested and investigated. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the advantages of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.41697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.41697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1600","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/1600/00041697.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow","Reservoirs","Mathematical model","Water resources","Delay effects","Security","Convergence","Nonlinear equations","Computational efficiency","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydroelectric power stations","load dispatching","load flow","power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term hydro-thermal dispatch","optimal power flow","mathematical model","cascaded multichannel reservoirs","water time delays","reservoir head variations","iterative process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Short-term hydro-thermal dispatch detailed model and solutions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41697/","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3563307","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term hydro-thermal dispatch detailed model and solutions","sourcePdf":"00041697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034819S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"20","articleId":"41697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":41700,"authors":[{"name":"I.

It is pointed out that the system static and dynamic performance can be improved by selecting the control mode in an adaptive manner according to the operating conditions. In steady state, the predictive mode is selected to reduce current ripple and to obtain stable switching frequency. During large transients, such as during starting or load variations, the hysteresis mode is selected to provide fast response. The performance of the proposed controls scheme has been studied by simulation, and the results agree well with the prediction. This adaptive control scheme can be implemented using a high-performance 16-bit microcontroller supported by a mathematical coprocessor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/41777/","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3596086","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1989","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive current control scheme for PWM synchronous motor drives: analysis and simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive current control scheme for PWM synchronous motor drives: analysis and simulation","sourcePdf":"00041777.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04143S","chronDate":"Oct.  1989","isNumber":"1604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"82","articleId":"41777","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":41879,"authors":[{"name":"L.E.

The physical mechanism behind SPM is gain saturation, which leads to intensity-dependent changes in the refractive index in response to variations in the carrier density. The effect of the shape and the initial frequency chirp of input pulses on the shape and the spectrum of amplified pulses is discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to the case in which the input pulsewidth is comparable to the carrier lifetime so that the saturated gain has time to recover partially before the trailing edge of the pulse arrives. The experimental results, performed by using picosecond input pulses from a 1.52- mu m mode-locked semiconductor laser, are in agreement with the theory. When the amplified pulse is passed through a fiber, it is initially compressed because of the frequency chirp imposed on it by the amplifier. This feature can be used to compensate for fiber dispersion in optical communication systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.42059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/1613/00042059.pdf","startPage":"2297","endPage":"2306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.42059","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042059.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-phase modulation and spectral broadening of optical pulses in semiconductor laser amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=42059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Self-phase modulation and spectral broadening of optical pulses in semiconductor laser amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42059/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3582481","volume":"25","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-phase modulation and spectral broadening of optical pulses in semiconductor laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00042059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065966S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"807","articleId":"42059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":42076,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

Asymptotic estimates and decoding algorithms are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3582121","volume":"38","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On t-error correcting/all unidirectional error detecting codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On t-error correcting/all unidirectional error detecting codes","sourcePdf":"00042121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04309S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"53","articleId":"42121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":42122,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

It is shown that the primitives improve the asymptotic running time of many algorithms by an O(log n) factor, greatly simplifying the description of many algorithms, and are significantly easier to implement than memory references. It is argued that the algorithm designer should feel free to use these operations as if they were as cheap as a memory reference. The author describes five algorithms that clearly illustrate how the scan primitives can be used in algorithm design: a radix-sort algorithm, a quicksort algorithm, a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm, a line-drawing algorithm, and a merging algorithm. These all run on an EREW (exclusive read, exclusive write) PRAM with the addition of two scan primitives and are either simpler or more efficient than their pure PRAM counterparts. The scan primitives have been implemented in microcode on the Connection Machine system, are available in PARIS (the parallel instruction set of the machine).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3572190","volume":"38","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scans as primitive parallel operations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scans as primitive parallel operations","sourcePdf":"00042122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047719S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"260","articleId":"42122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":42124,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the systems under consideration, it is assumed that nonnegligible delays are encountered in transferring tasks from one node to another and in gathering remote state information. Because of these delays, the state information gathered by the load-sharing algorithms is out of date by the time the load-sharing decisions are taken. The authors analyze the effects of these delays on the performance of three algorithms, called forward, reverse, and symmetric. They formulate queueing-theoretic models for each of the algorithms operating in a homogeneous system under the assumption that the task arrival process at each node is Poisson and the service times and task transfer times are exponentially distributed. Each of the models is solved using the matrix-geometric solution technique, and the important performance metrics are derived and studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.42124","doi":"10.1109/12.42124","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1525","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1616/00042124.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042124.png","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=42124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42124/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the effects of delays on load sharing","volume":"38","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"3572189","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the effects of delays on load sharing","sourcePdf":"00042124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036935S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"94","articleId":"42124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":42131,"authors":[{"name":"A.-H.

In the present work, the author generalizes these measures by restricting the potentially faulty sets to some subsets of the system components. Using this model, he presents a fault-tolerance analysis for the n-cube networks that shows that such networks can tolerate up to 2n-3 processor failures and remain connected provided that for each processor p in the network, all the processors which are directly connected to p do not fail at the same time. He also shows that in this situation the diameter of the network may increase only by a constant value. The author presents an O((kn)/sup 2/) time algorithm for determining if the network is disconnected when a set of k faulty processors, k<or=2n-2, is given. The previously known algorithms for the same purpose require O(n*2/sup n-1/) computation steps.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/12.42131","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042131.png","startPage":"1586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1616/00042131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.42131","endPage":"1591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized measures of fault tolerance with application to N-cube networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Generalized measures of fault tolerance with application to N-cube networks","volume":"38","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3572193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized measures of fault tolerance with application to N-cube networks","sourcePdf":"00042131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050033S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"247","articleId":"42131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":42135,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

C/sub F/) for deterministic (resp. randomized) encoding strategies is determined. Several important phenomena are encountered. (1) Although feedback does not increase the transmission capacity of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC), it does increase the (second-order) identification capacity; (2) noise increases C/sub f/; (3) the structure of the new capacity formulas is simpler than C.E. Shannon's (1948) familiar formula.

Optimum multiuser detection achieves important performance gains over conventional single-user detection at the expense of computational complexity that grows exponentially with the number of users. It is shown that in the synchronous case the performance achieved by linear multiuser detectors is similar to that of optimum multiuser detection.

Packets are assigned consecutive integers, and the transmitter continuously transmits them in order until a negative acknowledgement or a time-out is observed. The receiver, upon receipt of a packet, checks for errors and returns positive/negative acknowledgement (ACK/NACK) accordingly. Only packets for which either NACK or time-out have been observed are retransmitted. Under SR ARQ, the receiver accepts packets that are out of order and must store them temporarily if it has to deliver them in sequence. The resequencing buffer requirements and the resulting packet delay constitute major factors in overall system considerations. The authors derive the distributions of the buffer occupancy and the resequencing delay at the receiver under a heavy traffic situation. This enables the network designer to determine how much buffer capacity at the receiver guarantees certain specified performance measures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.42186","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042186.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1619/00042186.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.42186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"166","endPage":"173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resequencing delay and buffer occupancy under the selective-repeat ARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=42186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1989","displayDocTitle":"Resequencing delay and buffer occupancy under the selective-repeat ARQ","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42186/","volume":"35","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","accessionNumber":"3432782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resequencing delay and buffer occupancy under the selective-repeat ARQ","sourcePdf":"00042186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053367S","chronDate":"Jan 1989","isNumber":"1619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"56","articleId":"42186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":42188,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The approach is developed for sources characterized by a given set of partial covariance matrices and for hidden Markov models (HMMs) with Gaussian autoregressive output probability distributions (PDs). The approach aims at estimating the HMM which yields the MDI with respect to all sources that could have produced the given set of partial covariance matrices. Each iteration of the MDI algorithm generates a new HMM as follows. First, a PD for the source is estimated by minimizing the discrimination information measure with respect to the old model over all PDs which satisfy the given set of partial covariance matrices. Then a new model that decreases the discrimination information measure between the estimated PD of the source and the PD of the old model is developed. The problem of estimating the PD of the source is formulated as a standard constrained minimization problem in the Euclidean space. The estimation of a new model given the PD of the source is done by a procedure that generalizes the Baum algorithm. The MDI approach is shown to be a descent algorithm for the discrimination information measure, and its local convergence is proved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.42209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1620/00042209.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042209.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.42209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A minimum discrimination information approach for hidden Markov modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Signal processing algorithms","Covariance matrix","Speech recognition","Speech enhancement","Speech processing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Mutual information","Probability distribution","Acoustic noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","information theory","iterative methods","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum discrimination information approach","hidden Markov modeling","iterative approach","partial covariance matrices","Gaussian autoregressive output probability distributions","HMM","standard constrained minimization problem","Euclidean space","Baum algorithm","descent algorithm","local convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"A minimum discrimination information approach for hidden Markov modeling","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3572165","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42209/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A minimum discrimination information approach for hidden Markov modeling","sourcePdf":"00042209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057846S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"47","articleId":"42209","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":42210,"authors":[{"name":"N.

By using coset precoding and running digital sum feedback, any desired tradeoff can be achieved between the power and spectra of the relevant sequences, up to the optimum tradeoff possible. A fundamental theorem specifying this optimum tradeoff is given. A maximum-likelihood-sequence-estimation (MLSE) decoder for the original code may be used for the adapted code, and such a decoder then attains the minimum squared distance of the original code. These methods sometimes generate codes with greater minimum squared distance than that of the original code; this distance can be attained by augmented decoders, although such decoders inherently require long decoding delays and may be subjected to quasi-catastrophic error propagation. The authors conclude that, at least for sequences supporting large numbers of bits per symbol, coset codes can be adapted to achieve effectively the same performance and complexity on partial response channels, or for sequences with spectral nulls, as they do in the ordinary memoryless case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.42211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1620/00042211.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.42211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1620","startPage":"925","endPage":"943","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042211.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coset codes for partial response channels; or, coset codes with spectral nulls","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=42211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coset codes for partial response channels; or, coset codes with spectral nulls","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3561601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coset codes for partial response channels; or, coset codes with spectral nulls","sourcePdf":"00042211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03945S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"70","articleId":"42211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":42212,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

Simmons (PhD. diss., Queens Univ., Kingston, Ont., Canada) are optimal, or nearly so; they are all far more efficient than the Viterbi algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.42212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.42212","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042212.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1620/00042212.pdf","startPage":"944","endPage":"955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited search trellis decoding of convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Limited search trellis decoding of convolutional codes","volume":"35","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3561602","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42212/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited search trellis decoding of convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"00042212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049205S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"99","articleId":"42212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":42214,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Besides efficient soft decoding of small codes, the generalized rule enables utilization of subspaces of a wide variety, thereby yielding maximum-likelihood decoders with substantially reduced computational complexity for some larger binary codes. More sophisticated choice and exploitation of the structure of both a subspace and the coset representatives are demonstrated for the (24, 12) Golay code, yielding a computational gain factor of about 2 with respect to previous methods.

The connection between maximization of polynomials over the n-cube and error-correcting codes is also investigated; the results suggest that decoding techniques can be a useful tool for solving such maximization problems.

Wyner and J. Ziv (ibid., vol.IT-19, p.769-762, Nov.1973) for a binary symmetric channel is extended to arbitrary memoryless symmetric channels with binary inputs and discrete or continuous outputs. This yields lower bounds on the achievable information rates of these channels under constrained binary inputs. Using the interpretation of entropy as a measure of order and randomness, the authors deduce that output sequences of memoryless symmetric channels induced by binary inputs are of a higher degree of randomness if the redundancy of the input binary sequence is spread in memory rather than in one-dimensional asymmetry.

For comparison, samples with epoxy resin coating, Al ion plating, and without coating were also exposed to the corrosion test. After specified periods of corrosion testing, the permanent flux loss of the remagnetized sample was measured. Changes in appearance were also observed.

The nickel plating and Al ion plating withstood the humidity and autoclave tests reasonably well, but they suffered slight corrosion in the salt spray test. It is concluded that the use of nickel plating can provide high corrosion resistance and low cost of production.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.42430","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042430.png","startPage":"3776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/1621/00042430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.42430","endPage":"3778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of the corrosion resistance on Nd-Fe-B magnet with nickel plating","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42430/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of the corrosion resistance on Nd-Fe-B magnet with nickel plating","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3582304","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of the corrosion resistance on Nd-Fe-B magnet with nickel plating","sourcePdf":"00042430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057067S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"61","articleId":"42430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-13"},{"_id":42466,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

The authors made measurements on Co-P thin films that give a simple and practical way of investigating the role of interactions in the magnetic processes that occur in these films. All magnetic measurements were made on a PAR 155 vibrating sample magnetometer with a resolution of 10/sup -5/ EMU. The field measurements were made with a Bell-Gauss Hall probe calibrated with a proton magnetometer to give an accuracy of <0.1 Oe. The magnetic measurements made were the hysteresis loop. DC demagnetization, and isothermal remanent magnetization. It is noted that if a connection can be found between the results obtained and quantitative measures of noise in thin-film media, this work provides an important experimental link between models of the recording process and magnetic reversals in recording media.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042466.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.42466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/1621/00042466.pdf","endPage":"3883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching mechanisms in cobalt-phosphorus thin films","doi":"10.1109/20.42466","startPage":"3881","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=42466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Switching mechanisms in cobalt-phosphorus thin films","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42466/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3582332","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching mechanisms in cobalt-phosphorus thin films","sourcePdf":"00042466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036923S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"678","articleId":"42466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":42473,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The developed assemblies have the following features: (1) by using shimmed pole pieces in addition to the new material, a compact assembly is realized compared with currently used magnets. (2) The signal/noise ratio can be improved about 40% because the field is oriented vertically with respect to the patient. (3) Since the assembly has a four-column configuration, patients feel comfortable during examination. (4) Small leakage flux makes possible installation in a small room. (5) Operating cost is drastically reduced by using a permanent magnet. A typical assembly and its characteristics are shown. It is confirmed that the quality is almost at the same level as that of a mid-field superconducting magnet.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042473.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/1621/00042473.pdf","startPage":"3907","endPage":"3909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.42473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.42473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=42473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A development of a permanent magnet assembly for MRI devices using Nd-Fe-B material","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Permanent magnets","Assembly","Magnetic resonance imaging","Magnetic materials","Superconducting magnets","Magnetic flux","Noise reduction","Magnetic noise","Signal to noise ratio","Superconducting device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR","boron alloys","iron alloys","magnetic fields","neodymium alloys","permanent magnets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR improvement","high energy magnetic material","vertical field orientation","magnetic field stability","permanent magnet assembly","MRI devices","whole-body magnetic resonance imaging","shimmed pole pieces","compact assembly","signal/noise ratio","four-column configuration","leakage flux","Nd-Fe-B magnet material"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"A development of a permanent magnet assembly for MRI devices using Nd-Fe-B material","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3582341","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A development of a permanent magnet assembly for MRI devices using Nd-Fe-B material","sourcePdf":"00042473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033777S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"36","articleId":"42473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":42499,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The MLSD of RLL-coded and NRZ recording systems provides bounds on the performance that can be achieved, respectively, by peak detection systems and by partial-response schemes more complex than PR-IV and EPR-IV. Performance of PR-IV and EPR-IV signaling with MLSD is compared with the obtained bounds: the gain in recording density over peak detection provided by these partial-response schemes is established, and the merit of using more complex partial-response systems is determined.

The technique is applicable wherever the channel is equalized to a low-pass characteristic as in instrumentation and video tape recording with Miller-squared code or optical recording with a 1,7 code and pulse-width modulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42527/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","volume":"25","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3582395","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New detector for 1,k codes equalized to class II partial response","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New detector for 1,k codes equalized to class II partial response","sourcePdf":"00042527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056286S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"15","articleId":"42527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":42528,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.M.

The switching speed predicted by this one-dimensional model is in the nanosecond range and increases linearly with the external fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.42591","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00042591.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/1621/00042591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.42591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"4269","endPage":"4271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic switching process of sandwich-structured MR elements","volume":"25","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3582460","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic switching process of sandwich-structured MR elements","sourcePdf":"00042591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094823S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"22","articleId":"42591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":42678,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"42678","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":133,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio","Antennas and propagation","Predictive models","Radio propagation","Communication systems","Frequency","Interference","Propagation losses","Transmitting antennas","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio systems","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHF","coverage prediction","propagation modes","antenna characteristics","mobile radio systems","communication systems","800/900 MHz frequency bands","buildings","trees","interference","losses","radio propagation","land mobile systems","models","median transmission loss predictions","smooth terrain","knife-edge obstacle","800 to 900 MHz"]}],"abstract":"After an extensive list of definitions, a listing and brief description is given of a number of communication systems in the 800/900 MHz frequency bands.

A variety of experimentally or theoretically based propagation models, developed to predict radio propagation in land mobile systems, are then examined. After listing and summarizing the major features of the models, the models are compared in terms of the environmental and propagation factors they account for, and in terms of the output information they provide. The median transmission loss predictions of various models are compared for a given base antenna site. A detailed evaluation is provided to evaluate predictions obtained in the following basic situations: smooth terrain between base station and mobile; smooth terrain with a knife-edge obstacle located close to the mobile; and smooth terrain with a knife-edge obstacle at the midpoint of the path. Recommendations on measurement procedures are offered by the Committee on Radio Propagation.

An algorithm that can estimate the image flow velocity field when there are discontinuities due to occlusions is described. The constraint line clustering algorithm uses a statistical test to estimate the image flow velocity field in the presence of step discontinuities in the image irradiance or velocity field. Particular emphasis is placed on motion estimation and segmentation in situations such as random dot patterns where motion is the only cue to segmentation. Experimental results on a demanding synthetic test case and a real image are presented. A smoothing algorithm for improving the velocity field estimate is also described. The smoothing algorithm constructs a smooth estimate of the velocity field by approximating a surface between step discontinuities. It is noted that the velocity field estimate can be improved using surface reconstruction between velocity field boundaries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","volume":"11","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3562015","displayDocTitle":"Image flow segmentation and estimation by constraint line clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image flow segmentation and estimation by constraint line clustering","sourcePdf":"00042834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034854S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"114","articleId":"42834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":42836,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

A general theory of deriving 3-D moments invariants is proposed. The notion of complex moments is introduced. Complex moments are defined as linear combinations of moments with complex coefficients and are collected into multiplets such that each multiplet transforms irreducibly under 3-D rotations. The application of the 3-D moment method to motion estimation is also discussed. Using group-theoretic techniques, various invariant scalars are extracted from compounds of complex moments via Clebsch-Gordon expansion. Twelve moment invariants consisting of the second-order and third-order moments are explicitly derived. Based on a perturbation formula, it is shown that the second-order moment invariants can be used to predict whether the estimation using noisy data is reliable or not. The new derivation of vector forms also facilities the calculation of motion estimation in a tensor approach. Vectors consisting of the third-order moments can be derived in a similar manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.42836","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1633/00042836.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1064","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.42836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D moment forms: their construction and application to object identification and positioning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"3-D moment forms: their construction and application to object identification and positioning","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3562017","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D moment forms: their construction and application to object identification and positioning","sourcePdf":"00042836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046771S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"194","articleId":"42836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":42839,"authors":[{"name":"K.

After the error expression is introduced, it is applied to three cases: (1) a given classifier and a finite test set; (2) given test distributions a finite design set; and (3) finite and independent design and test sets. For all cases, the expected values and variances of the classifier errors are presented. Although the study of Case 1 does not produce any new results, it is important to confirm that the proposed approach produces the known results, and also to show how these results are modified when the design set becomes finite, as in Cases 2 and 3. The error expression is used to compute the bias between the leave-one-out and resubstitution errors for quadratic classifiers. The effect of outliers in design samples on the classification error is discussed. Finally, the theoretical analysis of the bootstrap method is presented for quadratic classifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.42839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.42839","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1633/00042839.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of classifier performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of classifier performance","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3562020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/42839/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of classifier performance","sourcePdf":"00042839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047887S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"57","articleId":"42839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":42858,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is shown that, at switching frequencies lower than the resonant frequency, the gain of the LCC-type converter is lower than the grain of the conventional PRC. This facilitates the converter design with a lower turn-ratio transformer and therefore allows for a higher operating frequency.

A simplified method of calculating motor torque ripple is introduced. This method enables calculation of velocity fluctuation due to torque ripple in the vicinity of the resonant frequency. Calculation results show that operation around the resonant frequency constitutes a problem. The current amplitude control method is effective for suppressing the torque ripple at the resonant frequency. This method detects the velocity fluctuation component and controls the current amplitude to eliminate that component. The velocity fluctuation component is detectable by using a filter that has a differential element. In addition, it is shown that the characteristic of the control system can be calculated with the aid of a Bode diagram, and its effectiveness is confirmed through simulation. From simulation results, this suppression method is found to be effective in reducing the velocity fluctuation to a practical level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.43009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1645/00043009.pdf","startPage":"504","endPage":"510","doi":"10.1109/41.43009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for suppressing torque ripple of an AC motor by current amplitude control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"A method for suppressing torque ripple of an AC motor by current amplitude control","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3559927","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for suppressing torque ripple of an AC motor by current amplitude control","sourcePdf":"00043009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029459S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"5","articleId":"43009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":43017,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

It is called a class-E converter because it consists of a class-E inverter and a class-E rectifier. The class-E rectifier acts as an impedance inverter and is compatible with the class-E inverter. Consequently, the converter can operate with load resistances from a full load to infinity while maintaining zero-voltage switching of the transistor in the inverter and the diode in the rectifier. It operates safely with a short circuit at the output. Because of a high value of the load quality factor Q/sub 1/, a narrow frequency range suffices to regulate the DC output voltage over the whole load range. The measured relative bandwidth was delta f/f/sub min/=42.2% as the load resistance was varied from 70 Omega to open circuit. The measured efficiency at the full load was 89% with a 9 W output power at 1 MHz. A family of class-E/sup 2/ resonant DC/DC power converters is given. The possibility of reduction of class-E/sup 2/ converters to lower-order resonant and pulse-width-modulation converters is shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.43017","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1645/00043017.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.43017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"468","endPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant DC/DC converter with class-E inverter and class-E rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Resonant DC/DC converter with class-E inverter and class-E rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43017/","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3559935","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant DC/DC converter with class-E inverter and class-E rectifier","sourcePdf":"00043017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117113S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"121","articleId":"43017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":43032,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

He discusses three maintenance models: the quick-fix, the iterative-enhancement, and the full-reuse model. He establishes a framework for classifying reusable objects and selecting a model. He offers a scheme that categorizes three aspects of reuse: the reusable object, the reusable object's context, and the process of transforming that object. The author then discusses what he terms reuse enablers: an improvement paradigm that helps organizations evaluate, learn, and enhance their software processes and products; a reuse-oriented evolution environment that encourages and supports reuse; and automated support for the paradigm and environment as well as for measurement and evaluation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3593695","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Viewing maintenance as reuse-oriented software development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viewing maintenance as reuse-oriented software development","sourcePdf":"00043045.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032558S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"122","articleId":"43045","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":43098,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

Using this figure of merit, it is predicted that the power losses incurred in the power device will increase as the square root of the operating frequency and approximately in proportion to the output power. By relating the device power dissipation to the intrinsic material parameters, it is shown that the power loss can be reduced by using semiconductors with larger mobility and critical electric field for breakdown.

By varying the gate-to-source voltage V/sub GS/, the resistance can be continuously tuned between 3 and 40 k Omega with a drain-to-source capacitance of <10 fF. The temperature coefficient of resistance is between -5 and -20 Omega / degrees C (for V/sub GS/ less than the pinch-off voltage). The combination of large resistance and low capacitance can result in high receiver sensitivity without sacrificing amplifier dynamic range. The feedback FET was fabricated adjacent to 1.8- mu m-gate-length JFETs with transconductances of 110 mS/mm, gate-to-source capacitances of 1.3 pF/mm, and DC amplifier voltage gains of 100.

The current and voltage data of each phase are simultaneously processed in two Kalman filter models. One model assumes that the phase is unfaulted, while the other model assumes the features of a faulted phase. The condition of the phase is then decided from the computed a posteriori probabilities. Upon the secure identification of the condition of the phase, the corresponding Kalman filtering model continues to obtain the best estimates of the current or voltage state variables. Upon convergence to highly accurate values, the appropriate current and voltage pairs are selected to decide the zone of the fault and the fault location. The scheme was tested on digitally simulated data. The fault classification was doubly secure using both voltage and current data.

By the proposed technique, the rotor position and/or the speed of the DC motor is forced to follow preselected tracks, even when the load condition varies. An algorithm based on minimum variance self-tuning control is developed for this purpose. The adaptive controller is effective even in the presence of external disturbances, provided that the system exhibits minimum phase characteristics. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated by using general-purpose nonlinear simulation software. The simplicity of the algorithm and the promising simulation results prove that this proposed controller is very effective in high-performance tracking applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.43255","startPage":"502","endPage":"508","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/1654/00043255.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.43255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive tracking control for high performance DC drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","DC motors","Robots","Control systems","Application software","Microprocessors","Process control","Student members","Senior members"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","DC motors","electric drives","position control","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking control","DC drives","adaptive controller","DC motor","robotics","actuation","manipulation","rotor","minimum variance self-tuning control","minimum phase characteristics","nonlinear simulation software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive tracking control for high performance DC drives","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3490776","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive tracking control for high performance DC drives","sourcePdf":"00043255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028108S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"30","articleId":"43255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":43257,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

These generators include multiple damping circuits. Continuous electronic switching in such systems results in a continuous change in the machine system network topologies. Hence, network modeling of such systems is done on an instantaneous basis. The natural abc frame of reference is used throughout. This is an advantage in that effects of magnetic nonlinearities, space harmonics in the MMFs, and space in the flux density waveforms as well as winding flux linkages on all machine parameters are readily taken into account. This method is applied to a two-pole, 74 kVA, 208 V, 24000 r/min permanent magnet generator, to study the generator-load system performance. Furthermore, the use of the model in studying rotor damping design options and effects of electronic component failure in the associated rectifier bridge on the generator-rectifier load system performance is given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.43257","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"518","endPage":"525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.43257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1654","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/1654/00043257.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic flux","Damping","System performance","Predictive models","Magnetic analysis","Performance analysis","Circuits","Network topology","Machine windings","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","DC generators","electric machine CAD","machine windings","rectifying circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous electronic switching","two-pole generator","rectified DC load-permanent magnet generator system","multiple damper windings","natural abc frame of reference","computer-aided modeling","dynamic performance","machine system network topologies","magnetic nonlinearities","space harmonics","flux density waveforms","winding flux linkages","rotor damping","electronic component failure","rectifier bridge","75 kVA","208 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided modeling of a rectified DC load-permanent magnet generator system with multiple damper windings in the natural abc frame of reference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43257/","volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3490777","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided modeling of a rectified DC load-permanent magnet generator system with multiple damper windings in the natural abc frame of reference","sourcePdf":"00043257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032054S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"15","articleId":"43257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":43259,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

In such environments, fuzzy logic is effective when the solutions need not be precise and/or it is acceptable for a conclusion to have a dispositional rather than categorical validity. The importance of fuzzy logic derives from the fact that there are many real-world applications which fit these conditions, especially in the realm of knowledge-based systems for decision-making and control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43406/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3492583","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"1","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge representation in fuzzy logic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge representation in fuzzy logic","sourcePdf":"00043406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061866S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"1663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"309","articleId":"43406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":43408,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

It used the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to compute both the derivatives and the convolution integrals. As a consequence, this method is easy to program, uses less computer memory than comparable methods, yields accurate predictions, and in general, offers a better rate of convergence. This technique, which is particularly suited for solving problems where the scatterer is made of a dielectric material and has a shape which can be approximated accurately by a rectangular grid, is applied to thin dielectric slabs with both electric and magnetic properties. It is shown that by choosing the conductivity sufficiently large, a thin dielectric slab behaves like a metallic plate. On the other hand, with a suitable choice of conductivity, a particular thin dielectric slab will act like a resistive plate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.43536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1668/00043536.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1283","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00043536.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.43536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the discrete Fourier transform method to thin dielectric structures (EM scattering)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43536/","displayDocTitle":"Application of the discrete Fourier transform method to thin dielectric structures (EM scattering)","volume":"37","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605937","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the discrete Fourier transform method to thin dielectric structures (EM scattering)","sourcePdf":"00043536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051305S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","articleId":"43536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":43543,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.

This approach consists of constructing a weight vector which minimizes the array output power subject to null constraint in the directions of the coherent interferers. In this way, the coherent interference is suppressed by the null constraint and the incoherent interference is suppressed by minimizing the array output. The approach requires the estimation of the angles of arrival of the coherent interferers. A simple bearing estimation method is described which can be applied to the scenario of one coherent interferer. The effect of error in bearing estimation on the array performance is discussed. The use of a high-order null constraint to counteract that error is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.43543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1668","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1322","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1668/00043543.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent interference suppression by an antenna array of arbitrary geometry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coherent interference suppression by an antenna array of arbitrary geometry","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605944","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent interference suppression by an antenna array of arbitrary geometry","sourcePdf":"00043543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033424S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","articleId":"43543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":43546,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.

The presence of mutual coupling distorts phase vectors of radiation sources and the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix. Two approaches are proposed to counteract that distortion so that eigenstructure methods can perform well. The method described first eliminates the distortion of the signal component of the the covariance matrix and then applies spatial smoothing to decorrelate the coherence between sources.

It is observed that, except for single-feed circularly polarized elements, their bandwidth is limited only by the resonant behavior of the input impedance and not by radiation pattern or gain variations, which usually are negligible over a moderate 10 to 20% bandwidth. Therefore, broadband impedance matching is proposed as a natural to increase the bandwidth. The maximum obtainable bandwidth is calculated using Fano's broadband matching theory. It is found that by using an optimally designed impedance-matching network, the bandwidth can be increased by a factor of at least 3.9, the exact value depending on the degree of matching required. A transmission-line prototype for a proper matching network is developed. The translation of this prototype network into a practical structure (e.g. a microstrip or stripline circuit) is considered. Practical design examples and experimental results which clearly show the validity of the technique are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.43553","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00043553.png","startPage":"1345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1669/00043553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.43553","endPage":"1354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An impedance-matching technique for increasing the bandwidth of microstrip antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"An impedance-matching technique for increasing the bandwidth of microstrip antennas","volume":"37","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3605974","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An impedance-matching technique for increasing the bandwidth of microstrip antennas","sourcePdf":"00043553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027258S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"268","articleId":"43553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":43555,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The approach is based on the idea of minimizing the weighted mean-square-deviation between the desired response and the response of the processor over variations in parameters. Three specific examples of robust design are considered: robustness against directional mismatch, robustness against array geometry errors, and robustness against channel phase errors. Initially, a general quadratic constraint on the weights is developed. However, it is then shown that the quadratic constraint can be replaced by linear constraints or at most linear constraints plus norm constraint. These latter constraints are no more complex than those required for designs which do not incorporate robustness features explicitly. Numerical results show that the proposed approach appears to offer a unified treatment for directly designing narrowband processors which are robust against various types of errors and mismatches between signal model and actual scenario.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.43585","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00043585.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1670/00043585.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.43585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"17","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to the design of robust narrow-band antenna array processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to the design of robust narrow-band antenna array processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43585/","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3605995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to the design of robust narrow-band antenna array processors","sourcePdf":"00043585.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033308S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"35","articleId":"43585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":43592,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that, for a perfect conductor, such a formulation leads to a stable, well-posed algorithm and that, in regions where the curvature of the coordinate lines is not great, the dispersion and anisotropy effects are negligible. Such effects become more pronounced in regions of high curvature, leading to unphysical phase shifts. The magnitude of such shifts and the amount of wavefront distortion is studied via numerical experiments using a cylindrical mesh. Near-field results are given for two canonical shapes for each polarization: the circular cylinder and cylinders of square and rectangular cross sections. These results are compared with those obtained by exact eigenfunction expansion techniques, with method-of-moments (MM) solutions, and with solutions obtained from an alternate FDTD approach. In each case, agreement is excellent. The propagation of a plane wave through a polar space in the absence of a scatterer is also examined, and it is shown that the FDTD algorithm is capable of tracking the incident wave closely.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.43592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1670/00043592.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"89","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00043592.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.43592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD algorithm in curvilinear coordinates (EM scattering)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43592/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD algorithm in curvilinear coordinates (EM scattering)","volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3606002","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD algorithm in curvilinear coordinates (EM scattering)","sourcePdf":"00043592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060394S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"148","articleId":"43592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":43598,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The measured R-R interval is modeled as the sum of the true R-R interval and the error measurement. The first- and second-order statistics of the error are computed in order to investigate its influence on the heart-rate-variability (HRV) power spectrum. The statistics are found to be functions only of the ECG sampling frequency, and it is shown that the power spectrum of the error contributes an additive high-pass-filter-like term (colored noise) to the power spectrum of the HRV. The accuracy of the model is tested by a simulation procedure. The model indicates that the relative balance between the HRV and error power spectra is important and should be checked before any variability analysis of heart rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.43621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"99","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.43621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1671","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/1671/00043621.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Spectral analysis","Heart rate variability","Error analysis","Frequency measurement","Electrocardiography","Additive noise","Colored noise","Testing","Heart rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","measurement errors","noise","patient monitoring","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement errors","sampling frequency","first-order statistics","error statistics","model accuracy testing","HRV power spectrum","electrocardiogram","spectral analysis","heart rate variability","R-R interval measurement","finite sampling frequency","true R-R interval","second-order statistics","power spectrum","ECG sampling frequency","additive high-pass-filter-like term","colored noise","simulation procedure","error power spectra","heart rate"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Electrocardiography","Heart Rate","Models, Cardiovascular","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sampling frequency of the electrocardiogram for spectral analysis of the heart rate variability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43621/","volume":"37","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3629268","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"2303276","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling frequency of the electrocardiogram for spectral analysis of the heart rate variability","sourcePdf":"00043621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039022S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"172","articleId":"43621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":43622,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Three such infrared laser simulations are described: (1) short-pulse polysilicon targets, (2) short-pulse TaSi/sub 2/-polysilicon targets, and (3) long-pulse TaSi/sub 2/-polysilicon targets. Reliability issues involved with each of these three laser target systems are discussed. Good correlation has been noted between the model results and two experiments involving ambient wafer temperature and long-pulse laser processing. The poly-silicide target is shown to present short-pulse infrared laser processing difficulties not encountered in a solid polysilicon link. These are caused by the strong optical absorption of the TaSi/sub 2/, the subsequent screening of deeper target material, and the high melting and vaporization temperatures of this silicide. The transparent top dielectric and the optical properties of solid and liquid silicon play important roles in the suggested reliability of the solid polysilicon link. Although the use of a long-pulse laser on poly-silicide targets appears to overcome some of the above-mentioned difficulties, subsequent reliability and performance degradation casts doubt on this technique for high-volume manufacturing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.43663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.43663","startPage":"2433","endPage":"2439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/1673/00043663.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-simulated explosion of poly-silicide links in laser-programmable redundancy for VLSI memory repair","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Computer-simulated explosion of poly-silicide links in laser-programmable redundancy for VLSI memory repair","volume":"36","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","accessionNumber":"3581923","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-simulated explosion of poly-silicide links in laser-programmable redundancy for VLSI memory repair","sourcePdf":"00043663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065942S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"10","articleId":"43663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":43669,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The device has the capability of capturing both TV fields at the same time and storing the data in two independently addressable field memories. The novel architecture permits operation in various modes ranging from the movie to a high-resolution mode with 968 lines. Additional features include operation in both an interlaced or sequential line-scanning mode and in an electronic-shutter mode if a small amount of image smear is tolerated or electronically subtracted from the signal. The image sensing area has an 11-mm diagonal, 486 lines, and 1134 active pixels in each line. The sensor fabrication is based on the virtual-phase technology with electron-hole recombination antiblooming. This allowed an easy implementation of a relatively complex charge domain multiplexing into three signal channels. The device can be used for color-sensing applications if a striped-color filter is attached to the chip or directly fabricated on the chip. The characterization results confirm the expected high device performance and demonstrate that the new concept is a viable alternative to existing architectures developed for similar applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new high-resolution 11-mm diagonal image sensor for still-picture photography","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.43669","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/1673/00043669.pdf","startPage":"2466","endPage":"2474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.43669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43669/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","displayDocTitle":"A new high-resolution 11-mm diagonal image sensor for still-picture photography","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3581929","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new high-resolution 11-mm diagonal image sensor for still-picture photography","sourcePdf":"00043669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05385S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"43669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":43676,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This is because of the drain-induced channel enlargement (DICE) effect, which switches on and becomes the dominant pt mechanism for very short channels. The DICE effect is independent of t/sub c/, and therefore the DICE-related pt component flows even with t/sub c/ to 0, so that strategies other than channel thinning are needed for the pt to be suppressed. A new implant step, called the retrograde implant, together with the LDD (lightly doped drain) structure, is shown to be able to suppress the DICE effect and thereby shift the limit of pt-immune BC-P-MOSFETs from 0.6 mu m down to 0.3 mu m. The pt encountered below a channel length of 0.3 mu m has been found to result from a pure DIBL effect rather than an incomplete DICE effect suppression. As a result, a further gain in channel shortening (without pt) would require the channel to be even thinner than 0.04 mu m.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.43679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/1673/00043679.pdf","startPage":"2548","endPage":"2556","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00043679.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.43679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous punchthrough in ULSI buried-channel MOSFETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43679/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous punchthrough in ULSI buried-channel MOSFETs","volume":"36","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3581939","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous punchthrough in ULSI buried-channel MOSFETs","sourcePdf":"00043679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033299S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"10","articleId":"43679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":43681,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The scope of the present work includes a description of: the scalability of the funneling length (size effects and proximity effects), the effects of reduced supply voltages, the potential barrier effect of an n/sup +/-p/sup +/-p (substrate) structure, compulsory exposure experiments, and a new effect that causes the soft error ( alpha -particle source-drain penetration effect, or ALPEN). A new funneling length behavior that cannot be explained by Hu's model (1982) is discussed. According to this behavior, it was found that a critical charge for a given soft-error rate, which determines the limitation of planar and trench memory cells, can be scaled down. Furthermore, it is shown that the ALPEN effect, which occurs when an effective channel length of a MOSFET is comparable to the effective funneling length, puts a new constraint on deep submicrometer VLSI design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.43681","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/1673/00043681.pdf","startPage":"2567","endPage":"2575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.43681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross section of alpha -particle-induced soft-error phenomena in VLSIs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43681/","displayDocTitle":"A cross section of alpha -particle-induced soft-error phenomena in VLSIs","volume":"36","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3581941","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross section of alpha -particle-induced soft-error phenomena in VLSIs","sourcePdf":"00043681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041549S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"25","articleId":"43681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":43693,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

Analytical evaluation of important parameters of the FETRODE and the distributed amplifier's circuit is carried out. A formula for the RF efficiency of the FETRODE is applied to an approximate relation between the output current and the input RF voltage that gives the dependence of efficiency on the ratio of the RF output impedance and the DC beam impedance. Potential advantages of future FETRODEs over solid-state FETs are discussed, assuming already established DC current emission levels as well as improved levels resulting from low-work-function materials other than Mo cones.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.43780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.43780","startPage":"2728","endPage":"2737","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/9500240/00043780.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9500240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wide-bandwidth high-gain small-size distributed amplifier with field-emission triodes (FETRODEs) for the 10 to 300 GHz frequency range","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","displayDocTitle":"A wide-bandwidth high-gain small-size distributed amplifier with field-emission triodes (FETRODEs) for the 10 to 300 GHz frequency range","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","volume":"36","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3582041","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43780/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wide-bandwidth high-gain small-size distributed amplifier with field-emission triodes (FETRODEs) for the 10 to 300 GHz frequency range","sourcePdf":"00043780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04159S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"9500240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"44","articleId":"43780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":43799,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.-F.

In one method, the scalar potential gradient, the so-called source term of the partial differential equation, is treated as an extra unknown; in the other this term is replaced by the total current of the conductor. It is shown that in handling real-life transient problems the first approach is superior, since, in general, neither the potential gradient nor the total current of conductors are given explicitly, but only active electrical networks that terminate both ends of the multiconductor system. The geometry of that problem is assumed to be two-dimensional, neglecting effects due to the finite length of the conductors.

The changes in the flux densities and energy contributions of finite elements from iteration to iteration are monitored, and elements in which the changes are more than a preassigned percentage are selected for refinement. Working with first-order triangular elements, whenever a triangle has to be refined, each of the three edges of the triangle is cut into two by placing a node in the middle. This scheme presents a natural extension of the nodal perturbation scheme. It is shown that combining the three criteria results in more accuracy, and studiedly moving the location of a new node on an edge away from the middle reduces the computational cost.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.43922","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/1675/00043922.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.43922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"322","endPage":"325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flux density and energy perturbations in adaptive finite element mesh generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1988","displayDocTitle":"Flux density and energy perturbations in adaptive finite element mesh generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43922/","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1988","accessionNumber":"3190905","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux density and energy perturbations in adaptive finite element mesh generation","sourcePdf":"43922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037018S","chronDate":"Jan 1988","isNumber":"1675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"10","articleId":"43922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":43932,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Using a novel theoretical framework, the microscopic origin of the observed dynamic losses is discussed, and a physical interpretation is given of the general fact that the loss per cycle is always a nonlinear function of f/sub m/. A theoretical procedure is discussed by which it is possible, for a generic material, given a single loss curve at a certain value of I/sub max/, to predict the dependence of dynamic losses on both I/sub max/ and f/sub m/, with an approximation within +or-10% in all the investigated cases. The behaviour of grain-oriented SiFe, which presents some specific complexities, is discussed in particular detail.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/20.43994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/1675/00043994.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.43994","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00043994.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General properties of power losses in soft ferromagnetic materials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=43994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1988","displayDocTitle":"General properties of power losses in soft ferromagnetic materials","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/43994/","publicationDate":"Jan. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3190977","volume":"24","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General properties of power losses in soft ferromagnetic materials","sourcePdf":"43994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058083S","chronDate":"Jan.  1988","isNumber":"1675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1067","articleId":"43994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":43999,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In this method, a sinusoidal magnetic bias field is efficiently generated by incorporating the bias coil in a parallel resonant LC circuit. Magnetooptic domains of either sign can be written by timing laser pulses to coincide with either positive or negative peaks of the field. Continuous domains of variable length are written by overlapping the domains generated by successive laser pulses. Using a bias field with a fixed frequency of 4.5 MHz, carriers at various lower frequencies were written on a TbFe disk with 47-dB carrier-to-noise ratio. Direct overwrite resulted in erasure of old carriers by at least 34 dB.

It is found that the classifier based on the least mean squares (LMS) criterion often performs considerably worse than the Bayes rate. The perceptron criterion (with suitable safety margin) and the linearized sigmoid generally lead to lower error rates than the LMS criterion, with the sigmoid usually the better of the two. Also investigated are the exceptions to the general trends: only if one class is known to have much larger a priori probability or variance than the other should one expect the LMS or perceptron criteria to be slightly preferable as far as error rate is concerned. The analysis is related to the performance of the back-propagation (BP) classifier, giving some understanding of the success of BP. A neural-net classifier, the adaptive-clustering classifier, suggested by this analysis is compared with BP (modified by using a conjugate-gradient optimization technique) for two problems. It is found that BP usually takes significantly longer to train than the adaptive-clustering technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.44018","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1676/00044018.pdf","startPage":"1030","endPage":"1041","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.44018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between criterion functions for linear classifiers, with an application to neural nets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between criterion functions for linear classifiers, with an application to neural nets","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3594428","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between criterion functions for linear classifiers, with an application to neural nets","sourcePdf":"00044018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154992S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","isNumber":"1676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"48","articleId":"44018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":44023,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

A particular example is the classic NP-complete problem of the traveling salesman (TSP) in which a minimum distance tour of n cities is to be found. J.J. Hopfield and D.W. Tank (1985) presented a simulation of a neural network that was able to produce good, if not optimal, tours. However, little information was given concerning the validity and quality of the network solutions in general. In the present study, a more detailed analysis of the TSP network is given. In particular, a sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to the bias-input and intercity-distance contributions to the network energy function. The results indicate that a statistical approach is needed to specify the performance of the network. Additionally, the behavior of the network is studied across a range in numbers of cities (10 through 30). An analysis of TSPs for 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cities indicated that the practical maximum number of cities that can be analyzed with the permutation-matrix network configuration is about 50 cities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","volume":"19","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3594429","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis in neural net solutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis in neural net solutions","sourcePdf":"00044023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022388S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","isNumber":"1676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"58","articleId":"44023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":44029,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The networks are fractal when the subnetworks corresponding to different layers have the same geometric forms but different sizes and may be related to different spatial frequencies in the pattern field. Information is stored naturally in the form of subpatterns and retrieved in the form of their permutations. Storage of two subpatterns or of mutually orthogonal subpatterns in each of the subnetworks, which is shown to guarantee local stability at the stored subpatterns, can be readily accomplished by simple saturation and threshold mechanisms. The error-correction capability of the subnetworks in a fractal network is shown to be higher than that of disconnected subnetworks of the same sizes due to the interlayer connections.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.44029","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1676/00044029.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.44029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Associative memory in fractal neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Intelligent networks","Fractals","Neural networks","Neurons","Stability","Aircraft navigation","Biological system modeling","Performance analysis","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","fractals","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnected subnetworks","fractal neural networks","layered hierarchy","spatial frequencies","mutually orthogonal subpatterns","saturation","threshold mechanisms","error-correction capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Associative memory in fractal neural networks","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3594434","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative memory in fractal neural networks","sourcePdf":"00044029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051418S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","isNumber":"1676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"10","articleId":"44029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44031,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

Since the Jacobian can be expressed in the form of a first-order linear recurrence, the time lower bound for computing the Jacobian can be proved to be of order O(N) on uniprocessor computers and of order O(log/sub 2/ N) on both single-instruction-stream-multiple-data-stream (SIMD) and VLSI pipelined parallel processors, where N is the number of links of the manipulator. To achieve the lower bound, the authors developed a generalized-k method for uniprocessor computers, a parallel forward and backward recursive doubling algorithm (PFABRD) for SIMD computers, and a parallel systolic architecture for VLSI pipelines. All the methods are capable of computing the Jacobian at any desired reference coordinate frame k from the base coordinate frame to the end-effector coordinate frame. The computational effort in terms of floating-point operations is minimal when k is in the range (4,N-3) for the generalized-k method, and k=(N+1)/2 for both the PFABRD algorithm and the parallel pipeline.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient parallel algorithms and VLSI architectures for manipulator Jacobian computation","doi":"10.1109/21.44031","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.44031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1676/00044031.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Efficient parallel algorithms and VLSI architectures for manipulator Jacobian computation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594436","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient parallel algorithms and VLSI architectures for manipulator Jacobian computation","sourcePdf":"00044031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033067S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1989","isNumber":"1676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"8","articleId":"44031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":44033,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It permits the detection of unknown obstacles simultaneously with the steering of the mobile robot to avoid collisions and advance toward the target. The novelty of this approach, entitled the virtual force field method, lies in the integration of two known concepts: certainty grids for obstacle representation and potential fields for navigation. This combination is especially suitable for the accommodation of inaccurate sensor data as well as for sensor fusion and makes possible continuous motion of the robot with stopping in front of obstacles. This navigation algorithm also takes into account the dynamic behavior of a fast mobile robot and solves the local minimum trap problem. Experimental results from a mobile robot running at a maximum speed of 0.78 m/s demonstrate the power of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Navigation","Sensor fusion","Robot sensing systems","Resumes","Path planning","Force sensors","Collision avoidance","Intelligent control","Cleaning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised control","mobile robots","navigation","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["navigation","position control","collision avoidance","fact mobile robots","real-time obstacle avoidance","virtual force field method","certainty grids","obstacle representation","potential fields","inaccurate sensor data","sensor fusion","dynamic behavior","running"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44033","doi":"10.1109/21.44033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1676/00044033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.44033","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for fast mobile robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for fast mobile robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  1989","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594438","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time obstacle avoidance for fast mobile robots","sourcePdf":"00044033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051617S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1989","isNumber":"1676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"749","articleId":"44033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44039,"authors":[{"name":"J.Y.

The extent to which the measures approximate visual perception was investigated in the form of texture similarity measurements. These results were also encouraging, although not as good as in the rank ordering of the textures. The differences may be due to the complex mechanism of human usage of multiple cues.

Character recognition is further divided into three phases: the digitization process, segmentation of words into characters, and identification of characters. The word recognition component is based on the Viterbi algorithm and can handle some identification errors. Character recognition was achieved despite several impeding properties of the Arabic script, especially the connectivity of characters. The processing speed is close to three characters per second with a 90% recognition rate.

By viewing the global cost function as a Gibbs energy function, it is possible to compute the gradients, inner products, and optimal-step size efficiently using the pyramid. Implementation of this algorithm for shape-from-shading results in a multiresolution conjugate gradient algorithm. The robustness and efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated for edge detection using the graduated nonconvexity (GNC) algorithm. This formulation is also applied to image estimation based on Markov models. A compound model for the original image is defined that consists of a 2D noncausal Gauss-Markov random field to represent the homogeneous regions and a line process to represent the discontinuities. A deterministic algorithm based on the GNC formulation is derived to obtain a near-optimal maximum a posteriori probability estimate of images corrupted by additive Gaussian noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.44062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"1408","endPage":"1425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.44062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1677","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1677/00044062.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Stochastic processes","Computer vision","Markov random fields","Shape","Differential equations","Integral equations","Energy resolution","Signal resolution","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised pattern recognition","computerised picture processing","Markov processes","minimisation","parallel processing","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","pattern recognition","cost function minimization","shape recovery","graduated nonconvexity algorithm","optimal-step conjugate-search algorithms","low-level vision","parallel pyramid implementation","line search conjugate gradient algorithm","global cost function","Gibbs energy function","inner products","shape-from-shading","multiresolution conjugate gradient algorithm","robustness","edge detection","Markov models","noncausal Gauss-Markov random field","near-optimal maximum a posteriori probability estimate","additive Gaussian noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pyramid implementation of optimal-step conjugate-search algorithms for some low-level vision problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44062/","volume":"19","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3594399","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pyramid implementation of optimal-step conjugate-search algorithms for some low-level vision problems","sourcePdf":"00044062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050651S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1989","isNumber":"1677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"16","articleId":"44062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":44063,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Closed-form least-squares solutions are given to the overconstrained 2D-2D and 3D-3D pose estimation problems. A globally convergent iterative technique is given for the 2D-perspective-projection-3D pose estimation problem. A simplified linear solution and a robust solution to the 2D-perspective-projection-2D-perspective-projection pose-estimation problem are also given. Simulation experiments consisting of millions of trials with varying numbers of pairs of corresponding points and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with either Gaussian or uniform noise provide data suggesting that accurate inference of rotation and translation with noisy data may require corresponding point data sets with hundreds of corresponding point pairs when the SNR is less than 40 dB. The experimental results also show that the robust technique can suppress the blunder data which come from outliers or mismatched points.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.44063","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1677/00044063.pdf","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.44063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pose estimation from corresponding point data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44063/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Pose estimation from corresponding point data","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594400","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pose estimation from corresponding point data","sourcePdf":"00044063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037355S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1989","isNumber":"1677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"407","articleId":"44063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44067,"authors":[{"name":"U.R.

Efficient constant-time algorithms for assigning a feature to its proper place on a feature sphere and for extracting the neighbors of a given feature from the feature sphere representation are presented.

The microstrip ohmic losses are evaluated by using an equivalent frequency-dependent impedance surface which is derived by solving for the fields inside the conductors. This impedance surface replaces the conducting strips and takes into account the thickness and skin effect of the strips at high frequencies.

An experimental method is developed which allows the evaluation of the transmission line spectrum in a very wide frequency band (15:1) with a single transmission measurement.

The MESFET model is derived from S-parameter characterization of the MESFET, using a wide range of bias voltages. The model is shown to be accurate at various frequencies, bias voltages, and input power levels. The nonlinear simulation utilizes a hybrid circuit analysis algorithm, which uses both time- and frequency-domain analysis. Unlike the harmonic balance method, the solution is optimized in the time domain, where the closed-form error gradient matrix (Jacobian matrix) is calculated. This algorithm is shown to have good convergence speed. To verify the MESFET model, two MMIC single-stage power amplifiers and test patterns of their matching circuits are designed. The load and source impedances presented to the MESFETs in the amplifier circuits are accurately determined by on-wafer S-parameter measurements of the amplifier's matching circuits. These S-parameter data are directly used in the simulation of the MMIC amplifiers. The simulation results agree well with the measurement data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.44131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1678/00044131.pdf","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2133","doi":"10.1109/22.44131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear modeling and verification of MMIC amplifiers using the waveform-balance method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear modeling and verification of MMIC amplifiers using the waveform-balance method","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606185","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear modeling and verification of MMIC amplifiers using the waveform-balance method","sourcePdf":"00044131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032566S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"44131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":44132,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

For the second unit, designed for low noise and gain, noise figures of NF=4.15+or-0.85 dB and gains of G=17.1+or-1.25 dB are achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606190","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic 2-18 GHz matrix amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic 2-18 GHz matrix amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00044136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029501S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"7","articleId":"44136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":44140,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For the 2.99- or 3.6-mm (OD) probes considered, a simple lumped parameter model shows errors above 1 GHz that increase greatly with frequency. An approximate model based on measured probe impedances from 1 to 18 GHz with samples consisting of water, methanol, and dioxane-water mixtures is evaluated. This model is more accurate than the lumped-parameter model and is better suited for calibration of the automatic network analyzer (ANA). The errors introduced in dielectric measurements by the use of approximate models for the probe are discussed.

The study is carried out using the 64 QAM and 256 QAM signal formats and two values of the roll-off factor in the Nyquist pulse shaping. The simulated compensation techniques include three types of predistortion, two ISI cancellers, and several nonlinear equalizers with or without decision feedback. A basic result is that decision-feedback equalizers do not offer any significant advantage over nonrecursive equalizers. It is also shown that ISI cancelers with a memoryless equalizer as first-stage decision device do not perform any better than nonlinear equalizers of similar complexity. Another contribution an improved fifth-order analog signal predistortion technique is analyzed.

A mean pyramid representation of an image is first built up by forming a sequence of reduced-size images by averaging over blocks of 2*2 pixels. A difference pyramid is then built up by taking the differences between successive levels in the mean pyramid. Progressive transmission is achieved by sending all the nodes in the difference pyramid starting from the top level and ending at the bottom level. The kth approximate image can be formed by adding the information of level k to the previously reproduced (k-1)st approximation. To gain efficiency, vector quantization is applied to the difference pyramid of the image on a level-by-level basis. If the errors due to quantization at level k are properly delivered and included in the next level, k+1, then it is demonstrated that the original image can be reconstructed. An entropy coder is used to encode the final residual error image losslessly, thus ensuring perfect reproduction of the original image. The experiments demonstrate that it is possible to achieve simultaneously lossless and progressive transmission with compression. At the intermediate level, the use of vector quantization results in a coding gain over that obtained using only a Huffman coder. Excellent reproduction is achieved at a bit rate of only 0.06 bits/pixel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.44205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.44205","endPage":"1349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/1681/00044205.pdf","startPage":"1339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive image transmission using vector quantization on images in pyramid form","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44205/","displayDocTitle":"Progressive image transmission using vector quantization on images in pyramid form","volume":"37","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"3606607","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive image transmission using vector quantization on images in pyramid form","sourcePdf":"00044205.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072247S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","articleId":"44205","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44207,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This receiver detects direct-sequence binary-phase-shift-keyed (DS-BPSK) spread-spectrum signals in the presence of narrowband interference by employing adaptive narrowband interference rejection techniques. The improvement in the system performance over that of conventional detection techniques is shown by presenting the results of experimental measurements of probability of detection versus false alarm for an enhanced total power detector. Also presented are certain results corresponding to detection of the spectral lines generated at twice the carrier frequency, wherein the goal is often not just signal detection, but also carrier frequency estimation. The receiver uses one of two transform-domain-processing techniques for adaptive narrowband interference rejection. In the first technique, the narrowband interference is detected and excised in the transform domain by using an adaptive notch filter. In the second technique, the interference is suppressed using soft-limiting in the transform domain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.44207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/1681/00044207.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.44207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1681","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive narrow-band interference rejection in a DS spread-spectrum intercept receiver using transform domain signal processing techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive narrow-band interference rejection in a DS spread-spectrum intercept receiver using transform domain signal processing techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606609","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive narrow-band interference rejection in a DS spread-spectrum intercept receiver using transform domain signal processing techniques","sourcePdf":"00044207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050392S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","articleId":"44207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":44209,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Two important requirements are that it should be fast enough for use within an iterative network design procedure and have an accuracy sufficient for that purpose. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the stationary behavior of residual capacity adaptive routing can be adequately modeled by a nonadaptive routing with suitably chosen parameters. An algorithm is proposed for the stationary version that is stable and fast but overestimates the blocking. A number of modifications of the model to improve its accuracy are examined.

System studies that involve transient simulation of machines require additional parameters that are not readily available, but nonetheless are essential for an accurate modeling of the machines. A mathematical method for estimating the equivalent circuit parameters of induction machines from the most readily available performance characteristics is presented. In this method, machine equations are used to estimate the parameters and sensitivity analyses are then performed with respect to the circuit parameters to match the given performance characteristics. An example is included to illustrate how well the performance of the estimated model matches that of the actual machine. The example is a three-phase, 1000 HP, 4.16 kV, 60 Hz induction motor. The example indicates that, with a restricted set of input data, it is possible to find the elements of a machine model that duplicates the given performance to a high degree of accuracy. Without sensitivity analysis, accuracies on the order of 10% are obtained, but after sensitivity analysis an accuracy of 0.1% or better can be achieved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3629594","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation for induction machines based on sensitivity analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation for induction machines based on sensitivity analysis","sourcePdf":"00044239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02796S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1989","isNumber":"1682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"61","articleId":"44239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":44251,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

By adjusting the weights among the incoming fields the algorithms can be used with noninteger conversion factors. The motion detector guarantees that the performance with still pictures is optimal. The weighted median filter smoothly follows horizontal, vertical, and diagonal movement. A video sequencer was used to compare different interpolation algorithms. The proposed algorithms left few visible artifacts in the picture, and the improvement over algorithms without motion detection was particularly pronounced.

The device provides larger dynamic range, higher sensitivity, and no image lag together with great packing density. A charge transfer channel formed around a trench eliminates the problem of insufficient dynamic range, which restricts the resolution. Because the Trench CCD occupies a small percentage of the total pixel area, the aperture area is increased, leading to improved sensitivity. Trench fabrication technology is used in dynamic RAM production; hence, further refinements can be expected to enable improvement of CCD image sensor performance parameters other than dynamic range. These features allow the development of a Trench CCD with 2 million pixels for 2/3-in and smaller optical systems, bringing a practical consumer HDTV (high-definition TV) camera closer to reality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.44291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/1683/00044291.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.44291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trench CCD image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44291/","displayDocTitle":"Trench CCD image sensor","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3561940","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trench CCD image sensor","sourcePdf":"00044291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030913S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","articleId":"44291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":44292,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Symmetrically permuted template data (SPTD) are employed in this algorithm to obtain a processing structure with a high degree of parallelism and pipelining, reduce the number of memory accesses to a minimum, and eliminate the use of delay elements that render the dimension of search area to be processed unchangeable. The inherent temporal parallelism and spatial parallelism of the algorithm are fully exploited in developing the hardware architecture. The latter, which is mainly constructed from two types of basic cells, exhibits a high degree of modularity and regularity. The architecture is especially suitable for applications in which adjustments of the dimension of the search area are constantly required. A hardware prototype has been constructed using standard integrated circuits for moving-object detection and interframe motion estimation. It is capable of operating on a search area of size up to 256*256 pixels in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.44340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1684/00044340.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.44340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for real-time and flexible image template matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44340/","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for real-time and flexible image template matching","volume":"36","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3572604","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for real-time and flexible image template matching","sourcePdf":"00044340.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033441S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"20","articleId":"44340","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":44341,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The system employs three multiprocessor clusters, each of which has 12 video signal processor modules (VSPMs). A VSPM in a cluster processes its assigned subimage by using an overlap-save technique. Each cluster uses the same multiprocessor structure, in which homogeneous processor modules are connected to input, output, and feedback buses in parallel and two bus switch units. By controlling these units, the clusters can be combined in pipeline and/or parallel forms. Each cluster also uses a variable delay unit which achieves up to one frame delay on the feedback bus. By using this unit, interframe processing can be carried out without using internal data memories in VSPMs for the frame delay. The employment of the bus switches and the variable delay unit increases flexibility for a variety of signal processing algorithms. The system performs 500 million operations per second and is currently used as a real-time evaluation system for low-bit-rate picture encoders.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1684/00044341.pdf","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00044341.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.44341","doi":"10.1109/31.44341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Motion pictures","Delay","Switches","Real time systems","Output feedback","Pipelines","Employment","Signal processing algorithms","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised picture processing","encoding","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","real-time systems","signal processing equipment","telecommunications computing","video equipment","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel connection","image processing","video signal processor","motion picture coding","multiprocessor clusters","overlap-save technique","homogeneous processor modules","pipeline","variable delay unit","interframe processing","bus switches","real-time evaluation system","low-bit-rate picture encoders"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"A real-time video signal processor suitable for motion picture coding applications","accessionNumber":"3572595","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","volume":"36","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time video signal processor suitable for motion picture coding applications","sourcePdf":"00044341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041654S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"19","articleId":"44341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":44344,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

This set of application-specific integrated circuits is motivated by the intensive computations required to perform motion compensation in real time. The architectures are based on data-flow designs, which allow sequential inputs but perform parallel processing with 100% efficiency. On the basis of these architectures, a programmable chip can be designed for motion vector estimation with different block sizes. The chips can be cascaded for a larger tracking range or for a video source with a higher pixel sampling rate. A chip-pair design is also derived for calculating fractional motion vectors with quarter-pel precision. The chip-pair design has been laid out, and the chip characteristics are given. Test circuitry is also included to increase the testability of the chips.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/31.44348","startPage":"1317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1684/00044348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.44348","endPage":"1325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of VLSI designs for the motion compensation block-matching algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44348/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"A family of VLSI designs for the motion compensation block-matching algorithm","volume":"36","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3572602","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of VLSI designs for the motion compensation block-matching algorithm","sourcePdf":"00044348.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036437S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"278","articleId":"44348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":44350,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

The architecture is based on the cooperating-data-path model, which allow both the throughput and the area to be optimized for this recursive algorithm. Careful scheduling of the operations on the partly parallel, partly shared hardware has allowed the load to be balanced on each of the four data paths. In this way, the inherently high degree of concurrency in the algorithm has been effectively exploited in the parallel pipelined hardware. The layout of the data paths has been generated by means of powerful CAD tools and the use of a parameterizable functional-building-block library. The corresponding global controller has been partitioned in order to optimize the critical path. This has increased the achievable clock rate even further, up to 10 MHz. The stringent I/O requirements have been taken into account. The resulting ASIC has been verified by register-transfer simulation. It is more than twice as fast as existing designs. The effectiveness of the cooperating-data-path model is thus clearly substantiated by this large, practical test vehicle.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1684/00044350.pdf","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient ASIC architecture for real-time edge detection","doi":"10.1109/31.44350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.44350","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"An efficient ASIC architecture for real-time edge detection","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3572606","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient ASIC architecture for real-time edge detection","sourcePdf":"00044350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044109S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"24","articleId":"44350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":44351,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The organization consists of n processors having row and column access to an n*n array of memory modules which stores an n*n image. It can be looked upon as a reduced mesh-of-trees organization in which the n/sup 2/ leaf processors are replaced by n/sup 2/ memory locations and each row (column) tree is replaced by a single processor with a row (column) bus. The class of image problems considered here requires dense data movement as well as global operations on image pixels. Examples include histogramming, image labeling, computing convexity and nearest neighbors. It is shown that while such problems can be solved in O(n) time on a two-dimensional mesh-connected computer with n/sup 2/ processors, they can also be solved on the proposed organization in O(n) time using n processors only. In addition, all of the parallel solutions presented are processor-time optimal solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1684/00044352.pdf","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal image computations on reduced VLSI architectures","doi":"10.1109/31.44352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.44352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Optimal image computations on reduced VLSI architectures","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3572608","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal image computations on reduced VLSI architectures","sourcePdf":"00044352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04467S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"13","articleId":"44352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":44360,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Jie Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Academia Sinica, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Jie Li","id":"37087575940"},{"name":"B.W.

This performance depends on the complexity of the problem to be solved, the error allowance function, the dominance relation, and the search strategies. The exact performance may be difficult to predict due to the nondeterminism and anomalies of parallelism. The authors derive the performance bounds of parallel OR-tree searches with respect to the best-first, depth-first, and breadth-first strategies, and verify these bounds by simulation. They show that a near-linear speedup can be achieved with respect to a large number of processors for parallel OR-tree searches. Using the bounds developed, the authors derive sufficient conditions for assuring that parallelism will not degrade performance and necessary conditions for allowing parallelism to have a speedup greater than the ratio of the numbers of processors. These bounds and conditions provide the theoretical foundation for determining the number of processors required to assure a near-linear speedup.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/1685/00044360.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"31","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.44360","doi":"10.1109/32.44360","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44360","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational efficiency","Parallel processing","Search problems","Polynomials","Testing","Tree graphs","Performance analysis","Degradation","Operations research","Expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","database management systems","decision theory","parallel processing","performance evaluation","theorem proving","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near linear speedup","parallel combinatorial OR-tree searches","performance","error allowance function","dominance relation","search strategies","simulation","sufficient conditions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"Computational efficiency of parallel combinatorial OR-tree searches","accessionNumber":"3618949","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational efficiency of parallel combinatorial OR-tree searches","sourcePdf":"00044360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057517S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"8","articleId":"44360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":44380,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The models are superquadrics with parametric deformations (bending, tapering, and cavity deformation). The input for the model recovery is three-dimensional range points. Model recovery is formulated as a least-squares minimization of a cost function for all range points belonging to a single part. During an iterative gradient descent minimization process, all model parameters are adjusted simultaneously, recovery position, orientation, size, and shape of the model, such that most of the given range points lie close to the model's surface. A specific solution among several acceptable solutions, where are all minima in the parameter space, can be reached by constraining the search to a part of the parameter space. The many shallow local minima in the parameter space are avoided as a solution by using a stochastic technique during minimization. Results using real range data show that the recovered models are stable and that the recovery procedure is fast.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.44401","startPage":"131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1687/00044401.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.44401","endPage":"147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery of parametric models from range images: the case for superquadrics with global deformations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44401/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of parametric models from range images: the case for superquadrics with global deformations","volume":"12","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3629826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of parametric models from range images: the case for superquadrics with global deformations","sourcePdf":"00044401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063413S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"401","articleId":"44401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44404,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Transistor minimization adopts a heuristic solution to the NP-complete graph partitioning problem with a powerful technique applicable to various ROM design styles and technologies. If diffusion mask personalization is permitted, the design can be further improved by solving the traveling salesman problem to minimize transistor source/drain regions. In table look-up ROMs compiled for 3- and 1.2- mu m CMOS with diffusion mask programming, the compiler eliminated over 45% of the transistors and drains. Test results show that 3- mu m CMOS ROMs have access times between 50 and 70 ns. ROMs with 1.2- mu m features achieve simulated access times below 20 ns.

A strategy is presented for overcoming these problems. A principal feature is the use of a domain contraction technique, which accounts for the fringing electric field throughout the infinite domain above and below the levels where the wires appear and provides a major reduction in the number of nodal points for a finite-difference computation. Moreover, an iterative method (successive over-relaxation) is used to alleviate memory requirements, a nonuniformly distributed nodal array is used to reduce the number of nodal points still further, and parallel processing is used to reduce execution time. It is argued that rounded edges and corners for the simulation of the wires are the only appropriate configurations at current levels of miniaturization. This avoids the problem of electric-field singularities at sharp edges and corners and results in significantly reduced capacitance coefficients.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional capacitance computations for VLSI/ULSI interconnections","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.44512","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1689/00044512.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.44512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional capacitance computations for VLSI/ULSI interconnections","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3580184","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional capacitance computations for VLSI/ULSI interconnections","sourcePdf":"00044512.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053217S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","articleId":"44512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44515,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

In an initial phase, the connectivity of each net is established in a fast way without taking the other nets into account. In general, this gives rise to conflicts (short circuits). In the second stage the conflicts are removed iteratively using connectivity-preserving local transformations. They reshape a net by displacing one of its segments without disconnecting it from the net. The transformations are applied in a systematic way using a scan-line technique. During this process, a subset of the segments at the position of the scan line is densely packed in the (two) layers available for routing. The remaining segments are pushed to the next scan-line position. Scanning in the four available directions (left to right, right to left, top to bottom, and bottom to top) is performed until all conflicts have disappeared or no solution is found within a maximum number of iterations. It turns out that the new approach to routing, as implemented in PACKER, also has practical merits: most of the well-known benchmark examples are solved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.44515","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1689/00044515.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00044515.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.44515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switchbox routing by stepwise reshaping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Integrated circuit interconnections","Iterative algorithms","Switching circuits","Wire","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC layout design","CAD","net connectivity","stepwise reshaping","switchbox routing","PACKER","connectivity-preserving local transformations","scan-line technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Switchbox routing by stepwise reshaping","volume":"8","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3580187","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44515/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switchbox routing by stepwise reshaping","sourcePdf":"00044515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047366S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"28","articleId":"44515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44550,"authors":[{"name":"A.G.

This method is a double-trellis-coded modification of the well-known C8PSK and is referred to as MC8PSK. Five coded bits are generated from four user bits in a single coding step and then mapped to an 8PSK symbol followed by a QPSK symbol. Given comparable decoder or receiver complexity, the coding gains of C8PSK and MC8PSK are comparable. Advantages of MC8PSK concern carrier synchronization. With C8PSK, problems with carrier phase tracking are encountered. With MC8PSK, these can be avoided, since carrier phase control can be based on the embedded QPSK. For some codes, error-free decoding is achievable in any locking condition of a QPSK-dependent PLL (phase locked loop), making synchronization and decoding especially simple. The partitioning of the channel symbol set, the associated bit mapping, and the code design are treated in order to describe MC8PSK. Aspects of receiver synchronization are discussed for C8PSK and for MC8PSK, focusing on QPSK phase-detection principles.

Analytical and experimental results are presented for two structures that implement a predictive carrier recovery system. These systems, which adapt their structure to match the spectral properties of the impairments, avoid the conflict between a wide bandwidth (to track fast jitter) and a narrow bandwidth (to minimize output noise) inherent in most carrier recovery loops. Such a system increases the likelihood that very bandwidth-efficient modems (e.g., 7 b/s/Hz for 19.2 kb/s voiceband modem applications) can provide reliable transmission in the presence of severe phase jitter and frequency offset. In particular, the predictive carrier recovery systems can track sinusoidal jitter present at more than one frequency as well as generalized time-varying phase jitter processes. Both finite-impulse-response (FIR) and infinite-impulse-response (IIR) adaptive phase tracking systems are considered. Prior limitations on adaptive IIR filters are overcome by designing a structure that is guaranteed to be stable and to possess only a global minimum as the filter coefficients converge to their desired values.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.44576","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1693/00044576.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.44576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1693","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive carrier recovery systems for digital data communications receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive carrier recovery systems for digital data communications receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3580900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive carrier recovery systems for digital data communications receivers","sourcePdf":"00044576.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060814S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"49","articleId":"44576","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":44578,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

The use of balanced incomplete block (BIB) designs is proposed to form the signaling frames. On each symbol interval the modulator selects a group of elements from a BIB design and divides its energy into the orthogonal waveforms corresponding to these elements. The multiple-tone FSK scheme based on these block designs is shown to increase greatly the bandwidth efficiency of a conventional M-ary FSK system. An implicit diversity is incorporated in the modulation scheme. Thus, a performance improvement comparable to that obtained by using time or frequency diversity is shown on a Rayleigh fading channel and also on an interference channel with partial-band Gaussian noise. The multiple-tone scheme based on this design is compared to a multiple-tone scheme based on Hadamard matrices suggested by J.F. Pieper et al. (1978). It is shown that similar performance is achieved on a fading channel, while an advantage close to 4 dB is obtained for the proposed scheme on an AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3580906","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An efficient modulation/coding scheme for MFSK systems on bandwidth constrained channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient modulation/coding scheme for MFSK systems on bandwidth constrained channels","sourcePdf":"00044578.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033583S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"37","articleId":"44578","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":44579,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A suitable receiver is presented whose signal processing is based on Nyquist signaling, requiring only one complex sample per modulation interval. Symbol synchronization and automatic frequency control are performed in a decision-directed way. Bit-error-rate (BER) performance over Gaussian, Rayleigh, and Rician channels is determined by means of computer simulations. The performance of coded 8-DPSK on the Gaussian channel is shown for a four-state convolutional trellis code. The unquantized outputs of up to three symbol detectors with delays of 1, 2, and 3 symbol periods are used for metric computation. The coding gain which includes losses due to timing and frequency synchronization errors is found to be 2.5 dB at BER=10/sup -5/ with respect to uncoded 4-DPSK. Much larger gains are achieved for fading channels if interleaving is applied. Using an eight-state trellis code the performance is determined on Rayleigh and Rician channels for various Doppler spreads and interleaver sizes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.44579","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00044579.png","startPage":"1340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1693/00044579.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.44579","endPage":"1346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of interleaved trellis-coded differential 8-PSK modulation over fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Performance of interleaved trellis-coded differential 8-PSK modulation over fading channels","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3580901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of interleaved trellis-coded differential 8-PSK modulation over fading channels","sourcePdf":"00044579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03336S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"56","articleId":"44579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":44580,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Haccoun and M.J. Ferguson (1975), the Viterbi algorithm, the M-algorithm, and the Fano algorithm for rate-1/2 and rate-2/3 trellis modulation codes on rectangular signal sets. The effects of signal-to-noise ratio and decoding-delay constraints on the choice of decoding algorithms for framed data are examined by computer simulation. Additionally, the genie-aided algorithm is used as a tool in estimating the asymptotic behavior of the M-algorithm. In general, the results conform closely to experience with convolutional codes due to the similar distance structure of the codes. The Fano algorithm produces good error performance with a low average number of computations when long decoding delay is permissible. The M-algorithm provides a savings in computation compared to the Viterbi algorithm if a small decoding delay is required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1693/00044582.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00044582.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.44582","doi":"10.1109/49.44582","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44582","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Convolutional codes","Viterbi algorithm","Modulation coding","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Costs","Delay effects","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced complexity decoding algorithms","trellis codes","genie-aided sequential algorithm","Viterbi algorithm","M-algorithm","Fano algorithm","rectangular signal sets","signal-to-noise ratio","decoding-delay constraints","framed data","computer simulation","convolutional codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of reduced complexity decoding algorithms for trellis codes","accessionNumber":"3592869","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of reduced complexity decoding algorithms for trellis codes","sourcePdf":"00044582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048452S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","articleId":"44582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":44586,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

The performance of all of these is analyzed, using the Gaussian minimum-shift-keying signal (GMSK) for illustration. It is shown that a GMSK receiver consisting of two matched filters and a four-state Viterbi algorithm performs with less than 0.24-dB degradation compared with the optimal receiver. The linear receiver is optimum for all values of E/sub b//N/sub 0/ (bit-energy-to-noise one-sided spectral density ratio). A design method for its filter is given.

A concise analysis of the inherent trellis encoder associated with CPM is given. It is then demonstrated that for almost all schemes of interest in practice, it is quite sufficient for the receiver to implement only four or six linear filters which represent proper reference signals. For a reduction in the number of memory states, decision-feedback sequence estimation together with minimization of the unprocessed intersymbol interference is proposed. Modifications of this procedure allow a state reduction without losses or with only negligible losses because only error events with large distances are affected. Combinations of these methods make possible an almost continuous tradeoff between receiver complexity and SNR (signal/noise ratio) losses. Several examples are considered for which evaluations of minimum Euclidean distances and simulation results are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1693/00044587.pdf","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.44587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.44587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An alternative approach to reduced-complexity CPM-receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Nonlinear filters","Bandwidth","Continuous phase modulation","Transmitters","Feedback","Interference","Digital communication","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase modulation","receivers","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent receivers","receiver complexity reduction","CPM","continuous phase modulation","linear filters","memory states","inherent trellis encoder","decision-feedback sequence estimation","intersymbol interference","state reduction","SNR","minimum Euclidean distances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"An alternative approach to reduced-complexity CPM-receivers","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3580910","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative approach to reduced-complexity CPM-receivers","sourcePdf":"00044587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070646S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"78","articleId":"44587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44589,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

This method utilizes a conventional QPSK modulator and a phase trajectory converter to approximate M=4, h=1/4 continuous phase signal and allows low cost, low complexity, and high rate (>1 Gbit/s) CPM modem implementation for bandwidth efficient transmission through nonlinear satellite channels. Using a communications analysis computer program it has been found that CPQPSK has 99 percent out-of-band power of 0.8R (MSK has 99 percent out-of-band power of 1.2 R where R is defined as bit rate), continuous phase trajectories, and nearly constant envelope amplitude. Simulation of realistic hardware designs indicate that the CPQPSK will require an Eb/No of 14 dB to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of 10/sup -6/. Forward error correcting techniques using block codes with an overhead of 10 percent indicate that the Eb/No requirements can be reduced to 11.2 dB for 10/sup -6/ BER.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00044589.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1693/00044589.pdf","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.44589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.44589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous phase quadrature phase shift keyed signaling technique with coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Continuous phase modulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Costs","Modems","Bandwidth","Satellites","Bit rate","Computational modeling","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error correction codes","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","continuous phase modulation","signaling technique","coding","continuous phase quadrature phase shift keyed","modulation","conventional QPSK modulator","phase trajectory converter","CPM modem implementation","bandwidth efficient transmission","nonlinear satellite channels","CPQPSK","out-of-band power","constant envelope amplitude","bit error rate","BER","block codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Continuous phase quadrature phase shift keyed signaling technique with coding","volume":"7","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3580912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous phase quadrature phase shift keyed signaling technique with coding","sourcePdf":"00044589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047459S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1","articleId":"44589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44605,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Rapid thermal oxidation was chosen as the process vehicle for these studies. The process uniformity and slip dislocation line patterns are strongly affected by both the transient and steady-state segments of the thermal cycles. The strong dependencies of the process uniformity and slip dislocation lines on the thermal cycle parameters suggest that the overall performance of a RTP reactor must be specified not only under steady-state thermal conditions, but also for controlled transient thermal cycles. Transient ramped-temperature RTP cycles with medium-to-high peak process temperatures (i.e. T/sub max/=1100 degrees -1150 degrees C) were found to be the optimal process conditions for growing thin gate oxides in the range of 60-120 AA with superior process uniformity and minimum slip dislocation line generation.

The heart of an iWarp system is the iWarp component: a single-chip processor that requires only the addition of memory chips to form a complete system building block, called the iWarp cell. Each iWarp component contains both a powerful computation engine that runs at 20 MFLOPS (million floating-point operations per second) and a high-throughput (320 Mb/s), low-latency (100-150-ns) communication engine for interfacing with other iWarp cells. Because of their strong computation and communication capabilities, the iWarp components provide a versatile building block for high-performance parallel systems ranging from special-purpose systolic arrays to general-purpose distributed memory computers. They can support both fine-grain parallel and coarse-grain distributed computation models simultaneously in the same system. The initial iWarp demonstration system consists of an 8*8 torus of iWarp cells, delivering more than 1.2 GFLOP (billions of FLOPS). It can be expanded to include up to 1024 cells.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iWarp: an integrated solution to high-speed parallel computing","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '88:Proceedings of the 1988 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, Vol. I","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1988.44670","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '88:Proceedings of the 1988 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, Vol. I","pdfPath":"/iel2/222/1696/00044670.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1988.44670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1988","displayDocTitle":"iWarp: an integrated solution to high-speed parallel computing","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3350313","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iWarp: an integrated solution to high-speed parallel computing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00044670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079441S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1988","isNumber":"1696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"222","citationCount":"158","articleId":"44670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44680,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

The techniques are based on an algorithm suggested by V. Strassen (1969). Variations of this scheme use matrix Newton iterations and other methods to improve the numerical stability while at the same time preserving a very high level of parallelism. One-processor Cray-2 implementations of these schemes range from one that is up to 55% faster than a conventional library routine to one that is slower than a library routine but achieves excellent numerical stability. The problem of computing the solution to a single set of linear equations is discussed, and it is shown that this problem can also be solved efficiently using these techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Concurrent computing","Arithmetic","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Strassen-Newton algorithm","high-speed parallelizable matrix inversion","massively parallel computation","matrix Newton iterations","numerical stability","Cray-2","linear equations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1988.44680","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '88:Proceedings of the 1988 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, Vol. I","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '88:Proceedings of the 1988 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, Vol. I","pdfPath":"/iel2/222/1696/00044680.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1988.44680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Strassen-Newton algorithm for high-speed parallelizable matrix inversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Strassen-Newton algorithm for high-speed parallelizable matrix inversion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44680/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3350323","conferenceDate":"14-18 Nov. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Nov 1988","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Strassen-Newton algorithm for high-speed parallelizable matrix inversion","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00044680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062818S","chronDate":"14-18 Nov 1988","isNumber":"1696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"222","citationCount":"11","articleId":"44680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":44914,"authors":[{"name":"G.-H.

A zero in the transfer function of the transadmittance stage results in a larger overall bandwidth than is possible in a conventional voltage-feedback configuration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Bandwidth","Cathode ray tubes","TV","HDTV","Isolation technology","Frequency","Computer displays","Driver circuits","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BIMOS integrated circuits","colour television receivers","feedback","high definition television","power integrated circuits","video amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HDTV set","HV DMOS technology","BIMOS IC","video output amplifier","colour TV sets","class-AB","CRT-driving amplifier","integrated output amplifier","output-voltage swing","large-signal bandwidth","small-signal bandwidth","cathode ray tube","projection television","high-definition television","transadmittance stage","feedback transimpedance amplifier","feedback transfer function","open-loop voltage gain","150 V","30 MHz","60 MHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.44972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1702/00044972.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.44972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated 150-V/sub pp/, 12-V/ns, class-AB CRT-driving amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An integrated 150-V/sub pp/, 12-V/ns, class-AB CRT-driving amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44972/","volume":"24","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3605879","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated 150-V/sub pp/, 12-V/ns, class-AB CRT-driving amplifier","sourcePdf":"00044972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040056S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"44972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":44986,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Unlike existing electrically erasable floating-gate memory circuits, this circuit does not require special fabrication techniques like ultrathin tunneling oxides or textured polysilicon. Instead, mask geometry is used to cause field-enhanced Fowler-Nordheim tunneling of electrons from a floating gate. Retention measurements at elevated temperatures indicate that the loss of floating-gate charge should be less than 0.1% over a ten-year period at temperatures below 100 degrees C. One limitation of this structure is that the rate of change of the floating-gate voltage can be quite small (e.g. 10 mV/s). A general trimming circuits, whose novel feature is that any number of trimming circuits can be independently and simultaneously adjusted across an entire IC, has been incorporated into a prototype CMOS op amp to decrease its input offset voltage from 10 mV to less than 0.5 mV.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.44992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1702/00044992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.44992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1702","startPage":"1569","endPage":"1575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trimming analog circuits using floating-gate analog MOS memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Trimming analog circuits using floating-gate analog MOS memory","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605882","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trimming analog circuits using floating-gate analog MOS memory","sourcePdf":"00044992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057643S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"88","articleId":"44992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44993,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The program derives all AC characteristics for any analog integrated circuit (time-continuous and switched-capacitor, CMOS, JFET, and bipolar) as symbolic expressions in the circuit parameters. This yields analytic formulas for transfer functions, CMRR (common-mode rejection ratio), PSRR (power-supply rejection ratio), impedances, noise, etc. Two novel features are included in the program. First, the expressions can be simplified with a heuristic criterion based on the magnitudes of the elements. This yields interpretable formulas showing only the dominant terms. Second, the explicit representation of mismatch terms allows the accurate calculation of second-order effects, such as the PSRR. ISAAC provides analog designers with more insight into the circuit behavior than do numerical simulators and is a useful tool for instruction or designer assistance. Moreover, it generates complete analytic AC circuit models, which are used for automatic sizing in a nonfixed topology analog module generator. The program's capabilities are illustrated with several examples. The efficiency is established by a dedicated sparse-matrix algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Analog integrated circuits","Circuit simulation","Circuit analysis","AC generators","Analytical models","Analog circuits","Switching circuits","CMOS analog integrated circuits","JFET integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","bipolar integrated circuits","circuit analysis computing","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect integrated circuits","linear integrated circuits","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active circuits","monolithic IC","ISAAC","symbolic simulator","analog integrated circuits","interactive symbolic analysis","AC characteristics","time-continuous","switched-capacitor","CMOS","JFET","bipolar","circuit parameters","transfer functions","CMRR","common-mode rejection ratio","PSRR","power-supply rejection ratio","impedances","noise","heuristic criterion","second-order effects","analytic AC circuit models","automatic sizing","nonfixed topology analog module generator","dedicated sparse-matrix algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=44994","doi":"10.1109/4.44994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1702/00044994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.44994","startPage":"1587","endPage":"1597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAAC: a symbolic simulator for analog integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ISAAC: a symbolic simulator for analog integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/44994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605884","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAAC: a symbolic simulator for analog integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00044994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045777S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"209","articleId":"44994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":44996,"authors":[{"name":"O.E.

Complementary differential pairs are used to achieve an almost rail-to-rail input common-mode voltage range. High linearity is obtained by summing currents so that the small-signal differential-mode voltage gain is constant over the entire input common-mode range. With a 5.0-V power supply, the total harmonic distortion is typically only 1% in a unity-gain configuration with a 4.5-V/sub p-p/ signal. The measured DC offset voltages versus input common-mode range track between the conventional and high-swing versions. These measurements suggest that the commonly feared crossover distortion may not be a problem when the current summation high-swing topology is used. The measured step response characteristics were excellent and exhibited no signs of phase mismatch crossover distortion for high-frequency signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3605896","volume":"24","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A family of high-swing CMOS operational amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of high-swing CMOS operational amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00045006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039459S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","articleId":"45006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":45007,"authors":[{"name":"D.D.

Experiments conducted using a four-element linear array operating in the MW RF range have confirmed that the predicted results are achievable under the nonideal conditions of quantized array weights and finite word length arithmetic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45121/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","volume":"38","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3629120","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust perturbation algorithms for adaptive antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust perturbation algorithms for adaptive antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00045121.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066985S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"15","articleId":"45121","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":45123,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

The problem of an oblique plane wave incident on an array with one-dimensional periodicity is examined. The unit cell of the array is composed of a number of thin resistive strips. The obliqueness of the incident plane wave combined with the lossy nature of the structure causes the transverse electric (TE) to z and the transverse magnetic (TM) to z fields to couple. To analyze the described problem, two coupled electric field integral equations that have as unknowns the equivalent surface currents on the strips in the unit cell are derived. The integral equations are discretized and solved approximately using the method of moments with subdomain basis and testing functions. The periodic Green's function is efficiently calculated using the Poisson summation formula. The interaction of the structure with the surrounding environment is described in terms of a generalized scattering matrix. Results are presented showing the TE/TM coupling behavior as strip resistance is increased for representative structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1707/00045123.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.45123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.45123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oblique scattering from lossy strip structures with one-dimensional periodicity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Strips","Tellurium","Couplings","Integral equations","Periodic structures","Magnetic analysis","Moment methods","Testing","Green's function methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","Green's function methods","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array unit cell","TE waves","TM waves","EM wave scattering","lossy strip structures","one-dimensional periodicity","oblique plane wave incident","thin resistive strips","transverse electric","transverse magnetic","coupled electric field integral equations","equivalent surface currents","method of moments","subdomain basis","testing functions","periodic Green's function","Poisson summation formula","generalized scattering matrix","TE/TM coupling behavior","strip resistance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Oblique scattering from lossy strip structures with one-dimensional periodicity","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oblique scattering from lossy strip structures with one-dimensional periodicity","sourcePdf":"00045123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038134S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"13","articleId":"45123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":45129,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

A receiving system in a vehicle measured signal fades caused by shadowing and multipath from roadside trees and utility poles. The propagation degradations were characterized for a system of three roads previously examined using a helicopter as the transmitter platform. The objectives of the MARECS-B2 MSS tests were to: (1) establish cumulative fade distributions for the particular satellite geometry for both rural and suburban roads; (2) validate the consistency of previous roadside tree measurements which employed a helicopter as the transmitter platform for the same system of roads; (3) obtain an additional set of fade levels at a lower angle hitherto not measured in central Maryland; and (4) combine the satellite-acquired data set with previous helicopter results and establish an analytic, empirically derived function describing the cumulative fade distributions for a family of path angles. An analysis of the satellite data has demonstrated the successful achievement of these objectives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.45129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1707/00045129.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.45129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile satellite system propagation measurements at L-band using MARECS-B2","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45129/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile satellite system propagation measurements at L-band using MARECS-B2","volume":"38","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629128","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile satellite system propagation measurements at L-band using MARECS-B2","sourcePdf":"00045129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028218S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"36","articleId":"45129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45134,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Tilston","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Tilston","id":"37831488000"},{"name":"K.G.

Richmond (1974) has been modified to suppress the computation of nonphysical asymmetric fields. Richmond's implementation uses piecewise sinusoidal expansion and testing functions, along with filamentary current approximations. The modified version, termed the bridge-current version, is described. The original program and the modified version are compared with each other and with simplified theory, where applicable, on the following symmetrical structures: a rectangular wire loop, a two-wire transmission line, and a log-periodic dipole antenna. The bridge-current version is shown to eliminate the computation of nonphysical asymmetric fields, to be essentially invariant with respect to variations in segmentation for the above-mentioned structures, and to produce results that compare well with simplified theories where applicable. It is noted that the bridge-current version is particularly advantageous for structures that include close-spaced parallel wires connected by short wire segments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3629133","displayDocTitle":"On the suppression of asymmetric artifacts arising in an implementation of the thin-wire method of moments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the suppression of asymmetric artifacts arising in an implementation of the thin-wire method of moments","sourcePdf":"00045134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056176S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"26","articleId":"45134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":45135,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The adaptive scheme is based on approximating the FIR system by noncausal autoregressive (AR) models and using higher order cumulants of the system output. As such, it is a blind equalization (deconvolution) scheme. The set of updated AR parameters is obtained by using a gradient-type algorithm and by using higher order cumulants instead of time samples of the output signal. It is demonstrated by means of extensive simulations that the adaptive scheme works well for both stationary and nonstationary cases. As expected, it outperforms the autocorrelation-based gradient method for nonminimum-phase system identification and deconvolution. Performance comparisons to existing methods are given, using as figures of merit the probability of errors in the restored input sequence, computational complexity, and convergence rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","volume":"35","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3618445","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive deconvolution and identification of nonminimum phase FIR systems based on cumulants","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive deconvolution and identification of nonminimum phase FIR systems based on cumulants","sourcePdf":"00045141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050134S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"57","articleId":"45141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":45143,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The authors propose a new PLA structure using an EXOR array. They derive upper bounds on the number of products of this type of PLA that are useful for estimating the size of a PLA as well as for assessing the minimality of the solutions obtained by heuristic ESOP minimization algorithms. Computer simulation using randomly generated functions shows that PLAs with the EXOR array require, on the average, fewer products than conventional PLAs. For symmetric functions, the authors conjecture that the PLAs with an EXOR array require, at most, as many products as the conventional PLAs. The proposed PLAs can be made easily testable by adding a small amount of hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complexity of mod-2l sum PLA's","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.45212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1710/00045212.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.45212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1710","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of mod-2l sum PLA's","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629294","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of mod-2l sum PLA's","sourcePdf":"00045212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037526S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1710","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"122","articleId":"45212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":45235,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The local transfer function is introduced, and the joint probability measure of the general Gibbs random field is derived in terms of this function. The resulting probability structure is required to satisfy the property of mutual compatibility. A necessary and sufficient condition for a Gibbs random field to be mutually compatible is developed and used to prove that a mutually compatible Gibbs random field is a unilateral Markov random field. The existence of some special nontrivial cases of Gibbs random fields that are mutually compatible is demonstrated. Conditions on the translation invariance and isotropy of the general Gibbs random field with a free boundary are studied. The class of Gibbs random fields with a homogeneous local transfer function and the class of horizontally and vertically translation-invariant Gibbs random fields are introduced and treated. The concept of a translation-invariant Gibbs random field is also explored. The problem of the statistical inference of mutually compatible Gibbs random fields is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.45280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1714/00045280.pdf","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1249","doi":"10.1109/18.45280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutually compatible Gibbs random fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Mutually compatible Gibbs random fields","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606130","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutually compatible Gibbs random fields","sourcePdf":"00045280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087333S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","articleId":"45280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":45281,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

CPC codes are first explained geometrically; their construction is described in terms of constraining data written onto a tape in such a way that when lines of varying slope are drawn across the tape, the bits falling on those lines sum to zero modulo two. This geometric interpretation is then formalized by the construction of canonical parity check matrices and systematic generator matrices for CPC codes and by computing their constraint lengths. The distance properties of CPC codes are analyzed, and it is shown that these codes are maximum distance separable convolutional codes. In addition, examples are given of both error and erasure decoding algorithms that take advantage of the geometric regularity of CPC codes. The technique of parity check matrix reduction, which is useful for reducing the inherent decoding delay of CPC codes, is described. The technique consists of dividing each term of the parity check matrix by some polynomial and retaining only the remainder. A class of polynomials that are particularly attractive for this purpose if identified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.45283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.45283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1714/00045283.pdf","startPage":"1264","endPage":"1276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross parity check convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Cross parity check convolutional codes","volume":"35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606133","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross parity check convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"00045283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046515S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"45283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":45284,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In general, such a channel has a memory that depends on the transition probabilities between the states. A method of calculating the capacity of this channel is introduced and applied to several examples, and the question of coding is addressed. In the conventional usage of varying channels, a code suitable for memoryless channels is used in conjunction with an interleaver, with the decoder considering the deinterleaved symbol stream as the output of a derived memoryless channel. The transmission rate is limited by the capacity of this memoryless channel, which is often considerably less than the capacity of the original channel. A decision-feedback decoding algorithm that completely recovers this capacity loss is introduced. It is shown that the performance of a system incorporating such an algorithm is determined by an equivalent genie-aided channel, the capacity of which equals that of the original channel. The calculated random coding exponent of the genie-aided channel indicates a considerable increase in the cutoff rate over that of the conventionally derived memoryless channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and coding for the gilbert-elliott channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.45284","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1714/00045284.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.45284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and coding for the gilbert-elliott channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606134","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and coding for the gilbert-elliott channels","sourcePdf":"00045284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021179S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"1714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"266","articleId":"45284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45288,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

Besides avoiding collision between new and retransmitted packets, the improved protocol eliminates reservation conflicts between different slots. Explicit acknowledgement is used, so that traffic to other zones served by the same satellite can also be accommodated. Assuming that 3% of the channel capacity is used for retransmission reservation, fixed frame and dynamic-frame SRMAs achieve effective maximum throughputs of 0.65 and 0.89, respectively. Both protocols give average delays considerably lower than slotted ALOHA, even when the throughput is as low as 0.2.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.45292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1714/00045292.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.45292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The scheduled-retransmission multiaccess (SRMA) protocol for packet satellite communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45292/","displayDocTitle":"The scheduled-retransmission multiaccess (SRMA) protocol for packet satellite communication","volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606142","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The scheduled-retransmission multiaccess (SRMA) protocol for packet satellite communication","sourcePdf":"00045292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068539S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","articleId":"45292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45293,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.M. van Pul","affiliation":["Building U.

They can be prepared by evaporation or sputtering on glass or polymer substrates. The alloys are ferrimagnets and exhibit a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The magnetic and magnetooptic properties can be well tailored by the composition as well as the deposition conditions. The information is stored by memory magnetic domains which can be written by a thermomagnetic switching process. The reading process utilizes the magnetooptic Kerr effect. In both cases the temperature profile of the saturation magnetization, the uniaxial anisotropy, and in particular the coercivity are of primary importance. At present, the most prominent candidates for device applications are GdTb-FeCo and Tb-FeCo alloys.

Radiation and guided modes are studied in each class, and their effects on loss and dispersion are described. For coplanar waveguides, dispersion due to interaction with surface wave parallel-plate modes in the substrate strongly depends on the ground-to-ground spacing (W+2G). If this spacing is small compared to dielectric wavelength and substrate thickness, both dispersion and radiation losses are minimized. In finite ground plane cases, small ground-to-ground spacing compared to substrate thickness is necessary to avoid the excitation of the microstrip mode and to minimize the deviation of the CPW mode from the odd mode of the ideal line. Limitations on the reduction of (W+2G) come from conductor loss, which imposes a minimum width requirement on the center conductor. If substrate thickness is to be kept large compared with this dimension, it is inevitable that, at high frequencies, the operation of the CPW will not be below the cutoff frequency of surface wave modes. However, the interaction of the CPW mode with surface wave modes is negligible for integrated circuit applications when ground-to-ground spacing is small compared with dielectric wavelength.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1716/00045333.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.45333","doi":"10.1109/22.45333","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45333","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coplanar waveguides","Dielectric substrates","Surface waves","Dielectric losses","Conductors","Cutoff frequency","Planar waveguides","Metallization","Dispersion","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","guided electromagnetic wave propagation","losses","waveguide theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC","dispersion characteristics","coplanar waveguides","substrate thickness","backside metallization","ground plane width","guided modes","surface wave parallel-plate modes","ground-to-ground spacing","radiation losses","finite ground plane","CPW mode","conductor loss","minimum width requirement","center conductor","cutoff frequency","surface wave modes","integrated circuit applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Propagation modes and dispersion characteristics of coplanar waveguides","accessionNumber":"3629228","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation modes and dispersion characteristics of coplanar waveguides","sourcePdf":"00045333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028852S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"149","articleId":"45333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":45341,"authors":[{"name":"Z.B.

Thirty-six transistors were mounted on parallel brass bars, which provide a stable bias and have a low thermal resistance. The output power degraded gradually when the devices failed. The grid gave an effective radiated power of 3 W at 3 GHz. The directivity was 11.3 dB, and the DC-to-RF efficiency was 22%. Modulation capabilities of the grid were demonstrated.

It includes the effects of both trapped hole ( Delta N/sub OT/) removal (annealing) and the time-dependent buildup of interface traps ( Delta N/sub IT/). Several sets of time-resolved transconductance data beginning at 10/sup -4/ s are examined for n-channel devices in light of the model. It is shown that, even though Delta N/sub IT/ generally dominates the change in mobility at late time, at early times (<or approximately=10/sup -2/ s) following pulsed irradiation the effect of trapped holes can be significant and in fact is usually dominant over Delta N/sub IT/. With increasing time, the mobility undergoes a limited recovery as the Delta N/sub OT/ effect diminishes due to the annealing of the trapped holes and the increase in tunneling distance to the nearest trapped holes. However, at t approximately 0.1 s, there is a turnaround in the mobility recovery followed by further degradation in time as the time-dependent Delta N/sub IT/ effect becomes significant. The experimentally determined mobility degradation coefficients are found to be consistent for several samples of varying oxide thickness and to scale with temperature according to the prediction of the model.<<ETX>>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606211","volume":"36","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-dependent degradation of MOSFET channel mobility following pulsed irradiation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-dependent degradation of MOSFET channel mobility following pulsed irradiation","sourcePdf":"00045369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041516S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"50","articleId":"45369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45371,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

A variety of analysis techniques are used to evaluate the postirradiation response of these structures, including low- and high-frequency capacitance-voltage techniques, subthreshold current-voltage techniques, and charge pumping. Although there are changes in the postirradiation energy spectrum of Delta D/sub it/, no clear evidence of defect transformation is observed on transistors or capacitors under any conditions examined. Postirradiation response at 80 degrees C is found to be similar in the two structures for low levels of damage (100 krad). For both structures, interface-trap densities continue to grow following irradiation under these conditions. In contrast, the postirradiation response of capacitors and transistors can differ qualitatively at higher levels of damage (1 Mrad), with the number of interface traps increasing postirradiation at 80 degrees C for transistors and postannealing for capacitors. These results indicate that capacitor structures may not be suitable for hardness assurance studies that involve elevated temperature irradiations or postirradiation anneals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606213","volume":"36","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of MOS capacitor and transistor postirradiation response","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of MOS capacitor and transistor postirradiation response","sourcePdf":"00045371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046035S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"34","articleId":"45371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45372,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Jupina","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Jupina","id":"37062329400"},{"name":"P.M.

Below 125 degrees C, only a slight increase in the positive annealing response was observed, consistent with a tunneling process to a trap level below the Si valence band edge. A much large increase in the trapped-hole annealing rate observed above this temperature is discussed in terms of two possible mechanisms: (1) tunneling to an excited state above the Si conduction band and (2) thermal detrapping of holes to the oxide valence band. The annealing of positive oxide-trapped charge appears to proceed at least partly by a compensation process called negative-bias reverse annealing. This effect is only slightly increased at elevated temperatures in hardened oxides, where it is significant even at room temperature. However, in a soft oxide, which did not exhibit significant negative bias reverse annealing at room temperature, the effect was observed at elevated temperatures. Two unexpected results related to the interface trap density are discussed: the late-time saturation value of the radiation-induced interface trap density increases with annealing temperature if positive bias is maintained, and the interface trap density oscillates with alternating bias at elevated temperatures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45373/","volume":"36","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3606215","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The nature of the trapped hole annealing process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The nature of the trapped hole annealing process","sourcePdf":"00045373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05486S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"229","articleId":"45373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":45374,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

This method requires that n- and p-channel transistors with identically processed oxides be irradiated under identical conditions at the same oxide electric fields. Threshold voltage shifts due to oxide-trapped and interface-trapped charge are determined from standard threshold voltage and mobility measurements by combining features of single-transistor midgap and mobility methods. These measurements can be made at currents two-five orders of magnitude higher than those required for midgap, subthreshold slope, and charge-pumping methods. The dual-transistor method contains no adjustable parameters, and includes an internal self-consistency check. The accuracy of the method is verified by comparison to midgap, subthreshold slope, and charge-pumping methods for several MOS processes and technologies. Dual-transistor measurements and analysis not only provide a useful check of single-transistor analysis methods, but also may be the charge-separation method of choice for many applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.45374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045374.pdf","startPage":"1816","endPage":"1824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and application of dual-transistor charge separation analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45374/","displayDocTitle":"Theory and application of dual-transistor charge separation analysis","volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606216","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and application of dual-transistor charge separation analysis","sourcePdf":"00045374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04109S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"64","articleId":"45374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-17"},{"_id":45375,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The thermal activation energies associated with single-particle-induced dark current events are observed to vary over the range 0.3-0.7 eV, with anomalously large events exhibiting relatively small values (<or approximately=0.4 eV). The data are described in terms of three mechanisms: conventional thermal generation in moderate-field regions, thermal generation over a reduced barrier in high-field regions, and phonon-assisted tunneling in the latter regions. Data and analyses indicate that the effectiveness of single-particle-induced displacement damage in producing dark current depends on the local electric field strength in the region in which the damage is introduced in a given device. These findings suggest that enhanced displacement damage effects will become more important as integrated circuit geometries are reduced.<<ETX>>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00045375.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045375.pdf","startPage":"1825","endPage":"1830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.45375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced displacement damage effectiveness in irradiated silicon devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Dark current","Current measurement","Displacement measurement","Performance analysis","Performance evaluation","Neutrons","Protons","Tunneling","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge-coupled device circuits","electron-phonon interactions","integrated circuit testing","neutron effects","proton effects","tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor","enhanced displacement damage effectiveness","charge-coupled devices","thermal activation energies","single-particle-induced dark current","thermal generation","phonon-assisted tunneling","single-particle-induced displacement damage","14 MeV","100 MeV","irradiated Si devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced displacement damage effectiveness in irradiated silicon devices","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606217","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced displacement damage effectiveness in irradiated silicon devices","sourcePdf":"00045375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057985S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"61","articleId":"45375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45378,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

Measurement of the variance is made for the first time using 61504 pixels of a charge-injection device. The variance is an intrinsic characteristic of damage due in part to differences in numbers and magnitudes of atomic recoils produced in each pixel. Calculations of the variance due to the recoil spectrum show that the magnitude of the relative variance is determined by Coulombic recoils. In fact, the experimental relative variance is almost two orders of magnitude less for fission-neutron-induced dark current increases than for the proton case. The relative variance was found to decrease as the proton energy was increased. The calculation shows that this trend is caused by the inelastic contribution to the relative variance of the recoil spectrum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.45381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045381.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","startPage":"1872","endPage":"1881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The generation lifetime damage factor and its variance in silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The generation lifetime damage factor and its variance in silicon","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606223","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The generation lifetime damage factor and its variance in silicon","sourcePdf":"00045381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048818S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"48","articleId":"45381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45391,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Transistors and ICs were irradiated at dose rates from 0.2 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s to 10/sup 6/ rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s. Over a wide range of process conditions and hardness levels, laboratory measurements of threshold voltage shift due to oxide trapped charge correlate well with IC leakage current at high dose rates for ICs with gate-oxide-dominated response. For ICs whose response is dominated by parasitic field-oxide structures, laboratory measurements of both transistor and IC leakage currents correlate well with IC hardness at high dose rates. For dose levels up to approximately=500 krad(SiO/sub 2/), it is shown that a simple factor-of-three overtest can be used as a conservative estimate of radiation hardness for strategic applications, provided that both functional and parametric testing is performed following X-ray irradiation at a dose rate of approximately=2000 rad(SiO/sub 2/)/s. For space environments, a laboratory irradiation to 1.5 times the required system level followed by a one-week 100 degrees C biased anneal gave conservative estimates of IC hardness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategies for lot acceptance testing using CMOS transistors and ICs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.45394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045394.pdf","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1980","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00045394.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45394/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Strategies for lot acceptance testing using CMOS transistors and ICs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606236","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategies for lot acceptance testing using CMOS transistors and ICs","sourcePdf":"00045394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088076S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"31","articleId":"45394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":45395,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

For this CMOS process the measured results indicate that the rising delay increases by about 2.2 ns/Mrad(Si) and the falling delay increase is very small, i.e., less than 300 ps/Mrad(Si). The amount of radiation-induced delay depends on the size of the load capacitance. The maximum value observed for this effect was 5.65 ns/pF-Mrad(Si). Using a sensitivity analysis, the sensitivity of the rising delay to radiation can be explained by a simple timing model and the radiation sensitivity of DC MOSFET parameters. This same approach could not explain the insensitivity of the falling delay to radiation.

In all cases studied radiation-induced failure is caused by effects in the field oxide, and the radiation-induced Delta V/sub T/ in the channel region is usually small at the failure dose. Time-dependent leakage current data for the field oxides are presented and discussed. It is found that the newer 1.25- mu m technologies generally survive the higher doses than the older 3- mu m processes, probably because they have thinner field oxides. It is also found that a wide variety of annealing responses can be expected for the various field oxides. This fact implies that great care must be taken in predicting leakage current response at doses and dose rates other than those used in testing. Finally, it is found that, qualitatively, the same annealing processes are observed in field and gate oxides, but there are quantitative differences in the important parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45426/","volume":"36","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3606268","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time dependent annealing of radiation-induced leakage currents in MOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time dependent annealing of radiation-induced leakage currents in MOS devices","sourcePdf":"00045426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055192S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"28","articleId":"45426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45431,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

The transients characterized in this work can be used to simulate single-event upsets in SRAM (static RAM) circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.45437","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2291","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS VLSI single event transient characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Diodes","Bonding","Single event upset","Circuit testing","Random access memory","CMOS process","Atherosclerosis","Laboratories","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alpha-particle effects","CMOS integrated circuits","environmental testing","integrated circuit testing","integrated memory circuits","ion beam effects","radiation hardening (electronics)","random-access storage","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alpha particles","SEU","CMOS VLSI single event transient characterization","MOSIS VLSI IC process","picosecond single-event transients","large-area diode test structures","MOS diodes","SEU transient measurements","Bulk CMOS","electrical interactions","multijunction effects","single-event upsets","SRAM","5 MeV","3 micron","B ions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"CMOS VLSI single event transient characterization","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606279","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45437/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS VLSI single event transient characterization","sourcePdf":"00045437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049582S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"21","articleId":"45437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45441,"authors":[{"name":"F.W.

Feedback resistor values for these parts ranged from 200 k Omega to 1 M Omega . All were fabricated using the 1- mu m, 2-level-poly, 2-level-metal process. Ions used for the tests were Ar, Cu, Kr, and Xe, providing a range of effective LET (linear energy transfer) values from 20 to 129 MeV-cm/sup 2//mg. With the 64K SRAM operating at 4.5 V and 90 degrees C, an upset threshold LET of 30 MeV-cm/sup 2//mg and saturation cross section of 1.5*10/sup -2/ cm/sup 2/ were measured with a nominal room-temperature feedback resistance of 450 k Omega . In Adam's 10% worst-case environment using the Petersen approximation (see E.L. Petersen et al., ibid., vol.NS-30, p.4533-9, Dec. 1983) this implies an error rate of 1.3*10/sup -7/ errors per bit-day. With a nominal 650-k Omega feedback resistance, a 256K SRAM had a calculated error rate of about 3*10/sup -8/ errors power bit-day at 4.5 V and 90 degrees C. These data agree well with earlier data for a 1 kb test chip. The minimal feedback resistance required to prevent upset versus LET is calculated, using an activation energy of 0.10 eV to estimate the decrease in feedback resistor value as a function of temperature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45441/","volume":"36","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"3606283","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SEU characterization of a hardened CMOS 64K and 256K SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEU characterization of a hardened CMOS 64K and 256K SRAM","sourcePdf":"00045441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052525S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"38","articleId":"45441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":45442,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

It is noted that the effect of the variance in the normal distribution of feedback delay has become pronounced because of the large number of resistors in state-of-the-art memory chips. Consequently, statistical analysis of the distribution of feedback delay is useful for proper interpretation of SEU test data to quantify device response for confident hardness assurance. Statistical analysis of the feedback delay distribution in cell arrays using write-time analysis shows that a feedback delay of 6 ns at the temperature of interest is sufficient to harden the AT&T SRAM cell against all LETs (linear energy transfers). To assure the hardness in all cells, however, the mean value must be set higher than the minimum required resistor value. Statistical information about the feedback delay population can be used to calculate the acceptable resistance limits. Alternately, a novel part acceptance plan based on direct electrical measurement of the feedback delay distribution is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045442.pdf","startPage":"2318","endPage":"2323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEU characterization of hardened CMOS SRAMs using statistical analysis of feedback delay in memory cells","doi":"10.1109/23.45442","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00045442.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"SEU characterization of hardened CMOS SRAMs using statistical analysis of feedback delay in memory cells","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606284","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEU characterization of hardened CMOS SRAMs using statistical analysis of feedback delay in memory cells","sourcePdf":"00045442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039427S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"23","articleId":"45442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":45443,"authors":[{"name":"P.T.

A good agreement was found between the two sets of upset-rate data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.45446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","startPage":"2344","endPage":"2348","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00045446.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The measurement and prediction of proton upset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The measurement and prediction of proton upset","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606288","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The measurement and prediction of proton upset","sourcePdf":"00045446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04033S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","articleId":"45446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45447,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The improved method uses the differential cross section in both energy and angle from the most recent Evaluated Neutron Data File (ENDF-V), an extrapolation of the ENDF data to neutron energies in the 20-50-MeV range, and the detailed energy and angular dependence of the energy deposited as ionization in the sensitive volume of the device. The revised conclusions principally are: (a) elastic scattering contribution is reduced from that predicted by previous methods by an energy-dependent factor approaching an order of magnitude at 19 MeV; (b) the contribution due to inelastic scattering processes is dominant, particularly for neutron energies above 10 MeV, as opposed to dominance by the elastic scattering predicted previously; and (c) the previously neglected alpha particle contribution in (n,alpha) reactions is significant for critical charges <0.03 pC.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporation of ENDF-V neutron cross section data for calculating neutron-induced single event upsets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.45447","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045447.pdf","startPage":"2349","endPage":"2355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of ENDF-V neutron cross section data for calculating neutron-induced single event upsets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606289","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of ENDF-V neutron cross section data for calculating neutron-induced single event upsets","sourcePdf":"00045447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035298S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","articleId":"45447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45449,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

Like latchup, snapback was observed macroscopically by detecting the abnormally high bias current condition. However, the snapback susceptibility characteristics differed from those of latchup, and consequently it was possible to measure the snapback responses unambiguously. The responses are expressed in terms of the cross section for varying bias and stopping power of ions. Test data indicate that CMOS devices with rather long channel lengths (on the order of 3 mu m) are free from SES when operated at about 5 V.

The primary failure mode encountered on FETs in this environment was susceptibility to single-event burnout. Burnout of the power DMOS FET was catastrophic. Another failure mode was single-event gate rupture. Although gate rupture is not as severe as burnout, its long-term effects are not known. Single-event gate rupture causes performance degradation due to increased gate leakage current. An increase in current can pose serious problems for applications that cannot compensate for the added performance degradation. Long-term reliability of the gate oxide may be affected, resulting in premature device failure. Numerous processing lots were fabricated to verify experimentally that each failure mode could be successfully minimized. Test results have shown that an n-channel, 150-V DMOS FET survived exposures to ions with linear energy transfers up to 80 MeV-cm/sup 2//mg. Hardening approaches are discussed, including their advantages and disadvantages in relation to the FET's performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of cosmic ray hardened power MOSFET's","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.45451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045451.pdf","startPage":"2375","endPage":"2382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Development of cosmic ray hardened power MOSFET's","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606293","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of cosmic ray hardened power MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00045451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035636S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"34","articleId":"45451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45455,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

Analysis of sensitive volume geometry is used to establish a relationship between it and SEU cross section. This relationship is used as a basis for geometric models wherein measured cross sections determine model shape parameters. Fits of one of these models to a range of experimental cross sections are exhibited. These fits and physical argument suggest that the actual sensitive volume shape differs from that assumed in most current calculations, i.e. a rounded shape with no lower corners is more appropriate than the box shape currently used. A correction that justifies a current heuristic practice of relating critical charge to an LET (linear energy transfer) on the shoulder of the cross section rather than to onset LET is devised. A further correction is obtained by a calculation using the omnidirectional chord distribution for a hemisphere. Together the two corrections show that nearly an order of magnitude error results from assuming that the sensitive volume is box shaped when calculating upset rate due to isotropic fluences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/1717/00045460.pdf","startPage":"2427","endPage":"2434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.45460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.45460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1717","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depletion region geometry analysis applied to single event sensitivity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Single event upset","Solid modeling","Shape measurement","Circuit testing","Uncertainty","Energy exchange","Error correction","Flip-flops","Microwave integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle detectors","radiation detection and measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depletion region geometry analysis","linear energy transfer","single event sensitivity","device geometry","single-event-upset","ground test measurements","sensitive volume geometry","cross section","model shape parameters","actual sensitive volume shape","critical charge","omnidirectional chord distribution","isotropic fluences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Depletion region geometry analysis applied to single event sensitivity","volume":"36","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3594219","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depletion region geometry analysis applied to single event sensitivity","sourcePdf":"00045460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044884S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1717","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"20","articleId":"45460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45466,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

The synthesis units have been defined after a careful study of the phonetic properties of modern standard Arabic, and they consist of central steady-state portions of vowels, central steady-state portions of consonants, vowel-consonant and consonant-vowel transitions, and some allophones. A text-to-speech system which uses this method has also been developed. The input of the system is ordinary Arabic spelling with diacritics and/or simple numeric expressions. Synthesis is controlled by several text-to-speech rules which are formulated and developed as algorithms more suited for computer handling of the synthesis process. The rules are required for converting the input text into phonemes, converting the phonemes into phonetic units, generating the synthesis units from the phonetic units, and concatenating the synthesis units to form spoken messages. The suitability of the method for synthesizing Arabic has been shown by realizing all its functions on a personal computer and by conducting understandability test on synthesized speech.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.45531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1721/00045531.pdf","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.45531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unrestricted vocabulary Arabic speech synthesis system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45531/","displayDocTitle":"An unrestricted vocabulary Arabic speech synthesis system","volume":"37","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606711","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unrestricted vocabulary Arabic speech synthesis system","sourcePdf":"00045531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032884S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"39","articleId":"45531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45532,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The approach is based on statistical modeling of the clean speech signal and the noise process using long training sequences from the two processes. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) with mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive (AR) output probability distributions (PDs) are used to model the clean speech signal. The model for the noise process depends on its nature. The parameter set of the HMM model is estimated using the Baum or the EM (estimation-maximization) algorithm. The noisy speech is enhanced by reestimating the clean speech waveform using the EM algorithm. Efficient approximations of the training and enhancement procedures are examined. This results in the segmental k-means approach for hidden Markov modeling, in which the state sequence and the parameter set of the model are alternately estimated. Similarly, the enhancement is done by alternate estimation of the state and observation sequences. An approximate improvement of 4.0-6.0 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved at 10-dB input SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.45532","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"1846","endPage":"1856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1721/00045532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.45532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of hidden Markov models for enhancing noisy speech","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech enhancement","Speech processing","Signal processing","Additive noise","Distortion measurement","Degradation","State estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Speech analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","speech analysis and processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","maximum-a-posteriori approach","speech signals","additive noise","statistical modeling","training sequences","Gaussian autoregressive","probability distributions","estimation-maximization","segmental k-means approach"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"On the application of hidden Markov models for enhancing noisy speech","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606712","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45532/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of hidden Markov models for enhancing noisy speech","sourcePdf":"00045532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097271S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"116","articleId":"45532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":45533,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A phoneme X is observed as a variable-length sequence of frames, where each frame is represented by a parameter vector and the length of the sequence is random. The stochastic segment model consists of (1) a time warping of the variable-length segment X into a fixed-length segment Y called a resampled segment and (2) a joint density function of the parameters of X which in this study is a Gaussian density. The segment model represents spectra/temporal structure over the entire phoneme. The model also allows the incorporation in Y of acoustic-phonetic features derived from X, in addition to the usual spectral features that have been used in hidden Markov modeling and dynamic time warping approaches to speech recognition. The authors describe the stochastic segment model, the recognition algorithm, and an iterative training algorithm for estimating segment models from continuous speech. They present several results using segment models in two speaker-dependent recognition tasks and compare the performance of the stochastic segment model to the performance of the hidden Markov models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606713","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"37","issue":"12","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic segment model for phoneme-based continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic segment model for phoneme-based continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00045533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073688S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"114","articleId":"45533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45536,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It results in a basic structure for these connectionist networks that operates like a universal simulation tool, accomplishing the information storage/retrieval process by altering the pattern of connections among a large number of primitive units and/or by modifying certain weights associated with each connection.

Particular attention is paid to common estimation structures and to practical problems not properly solved yet. The problem of image reconstruction and restoration is first formulated. Some of the current regularization approaches used to solve the problem are then described. The concepts of a priori information and compound criterion are introduced. A Bayesian interpretation of the regularization techniques is given which clarifies the role of the tuning parameters and indicates how they could be estimated. The practical aspects of computing the solution, first when the hyperparameters are known and second when they must be estimated, are then considered.

The first approach requires structural descriptions of the image and the process which has altered it, whereas the second requires statistical descriptions of the image and the process which has altered it. The many different classes of rank-order-based filters that have been developed over the last few decades are reviewed in the context of these two approaches. One of the filter classes, stack filters, is then emphasized. These filters, which are defined by a weak superposition property and an ordering property, cover all 2-D rank-order operations. The theory of minimum-mean-absolute-error (MMAE) stack filtering is reviewed and extended to two dimensions. A theory of optimal stack filtering under structural constraints and goals is then developed. These two optimal stack filtering theories are combined into a single design theory for rank-order based filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","volume":"37","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"3606732","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal stack filtering and the estimation and structural approaches to image processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal stack filtering and the estimation and structural approaches to image processing","sourcePdf":"00045552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128288S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1721","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"149","articleId":"45552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45553,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Preliminary performance studies of a simple frequency-domain smoothing method show that proper spatial filtering can be achieved by frequency-domain smoothing, whether the desired signal and interference are correlated or not.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.45574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1722/00045574.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.45574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"193","endPage":"195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for correlated signal and interference: a frequency domain smoothing approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for correlated signal and interference: a frequency domain smoothing approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45574/","volume":"38","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629769","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming for correlated signal and interference: a frequency domain smoothing approach","sourcePdf":"45574.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038564S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"8","articleId":"45574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45613,"authors":[{"name":"L.C.

Using the beamformer power outputs, the beam response functions, and optionally a background-noise spatial power spectral density (PSD) as input, the method gives a point-mass estimate of the signal PSD as function of bearing. The estimate is defined from the solution of a semiinfinite linear optimization problem and can be computed efficiently by solving a sequence of linear programs obtained by discretization using adaptive mesh refinement. In theory the estimate can achieve arbitrary resolution of the bearings of distinct plane-wave signals in stationary noise. For actual hydroacoustic data, it has been shown to yield a significant improvement of the resolution obtained by traditional beamforming.

Just as in the block-coding formulation, the optimum source coder consists of an optimum estimator followed by optimum source coding of the resulting estimates. However, unlike the block approach, the alphabet-constrained viewpoint admits estimators based on the past history of source observations outside the current block of interest. If delayed encoding is allowed, the estimator is an optimum smoother. For Gauss-Markov sources, the encoding performance is characterized in terms of the estimation error covariance, and it is demonstrated that for moderate block sizes, significant reduction in mean-squared error can be achieved compared to the block coder performance. Extensive experiments are reported for vector quantization of noisy speech using the Y.L. Linde, A. Buzo, and R.M. Gray (IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.COM-28, p.84-95, 1980) training mode vector quantizer. The results indicate that the alphabet-constrained estimator, which is a Kalman filter, is superior to the block estimator, and, in particular, that adaptivity is critical for good performance over a variety of speech sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.45615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.45615","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1722/00045615.pdf","startPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation and noisy source coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45615/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation and noisy source coding","volume":"38","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3606739","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation and noisy source coding","sourcePdf":"00045615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043565S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"13","articleId":"45615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45616,"authors":[{"name":"K.-F.

SPHINX is based on discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) with LPC- (linear-predictive-coding) derived parameters. To provide speaker independence, knowledge was added to these HMMs in several ways: multiple codebooks of fixed-width parameters, and an enhanced recognizer with carefully designed models and word-duration modeling. To deal with coarticulation in continuous speech, yet still adequately represent a large vocabulary, two new subword speech units are introduced: function-word-dependent phone models and generalized triphone models.

The model has been implemented in a general-purpose circuit simulator, iSMILE, which is compatible with SPICE.

A systematic design procedure for the cascade of prefilters and the equalizer is given, leading to computationally efficient FIR filters. The procedure is based on combining the prefilter-equalizer concepts of J.W. Adams and A.N. Wilson, Jr. (1983) with the IFIR (interpolated FIR) concepts of Y. Neuvo et al. (1987).

The resulting oscillation frequencies are proportional to the transconductance of the OTA, and this makes the structures well-suited for building voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs). Amplitude stabilization circuits using both automatic gain control (AGC) mechanisms and limitation schemes are presented.

Comparison of the values measured (using this calibration technique) for a tilted cylinder in the X-band with theoretical values shows agreement within +or-0.3 dB in magnitude and +or-5 degrees in phase. The radar overall cross-polarization isolation was 25 dB.

One of the applications of such a program is in electrical well logging, where all exploration tools operate in a borehole drilled into the ground for geophysical subsurface sensing. The borehole surrounded by an invasion zone can be modeled as a multicylindrically layered geometry. The authors also present an algorithm to study the effect of eccentricity (source and mandrel not in the center of the borehole) in the presence of concentric invasion zones around the borehole. The authors' algorithm is used to study the eccentricity and invasion effects on an induction measurement and a dielectric logging measurement. In the case of dielectric logging, they find that the invasion zone can cause resonance effects, and that these effects remain when the tool is eccentered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of tool eccentricity on some electrical well-logging tools","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.45750","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/1726/00045750.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.45750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45750/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"Effect of tool eccentricity on some electrical well-logging tools","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3606884","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of tool eccentricity on some electrical well-logging tools","sourcePdf":"00045750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085021S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"33","articleId":"45750","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45790,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

These algorithms are used to control manipulator links antagonistically driven by two actuators via tendons. They have been simulated and experimentally shown to produce better active and passive performance for an electric test system than control algorithms developed earlier. There are two fundamental differences between the control algorithms and earlier ones. First, the new algorithms allow both positive and negative (push and pull) commands to be given to the actuators. Previous systems generated only pull commands, ensuring that tendons would not go slack and give rise to backlash and other problems. The new controllers allow push commands to the actuators, but still do not allow tendons to go slack. Second, each actuator, in addition to being fed back its respective tendon force, is fed back both positive nd negative manipulator joint torques. This feature allows both actuators to respond simultaneously to torque errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/37/1728/00045790.pdf","doi":"10.1109/37.45790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.45790","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control strategies for tendon-driven manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45790/","displayDocTitle":"Control strategies for tendon-driven manipulators","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3616187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control strategies for tendon-driven manipulators","sourcePdf":"00045790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036902S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"44","articleId":"45790","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45791,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The objective is to control the tip position of the flexible manipulator in the presence of joint friction and changes in payload. Both linear and nonlinear frictions are overcome by using a very robust control scheme for flexible manipulators. The control scheme is based on two nested feedback loops: an inner loop, to control the position of the motor, and an outer loop, to control the tip position. Compensation for changes in load is achieved by decoupling the dynamics of the system and then applying a very simple adaptive control for the tip position. This results in a simple control law that needs minimal computing effort and, thus, can be used for real-time control of the flexible arms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45791/","volume":"10","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3616188","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of a single-link flexible manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of a single-link flexible manipulator","sourcePdf":"00045791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038784S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"37","citationCount":"69","articleId":"45791","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45792,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

This approach requires a new style of programming technique, especially if a universal solution procedure for all types of architectures is needed. Knowledge of the design process involves unification of the heterogeneous (i.e. behavior and structure) information between a system and its parts, as well as representation of functional modules in order to ensure their reusability in an efficient manner. Following these strategies, a logic synthesis expert system, ProLogic, is developed, and the system is evaluated using MPU-type VLSIs. It is found that the universal connecting procedure for any compound functional module that unifies the behavioral and structural specifications between a total module and its parts improves logic design efficiency by a factor of 2 and that logic programming, object-oriented frames, and rule bases implemented in ProLogic improve software productivity by a factor of 5.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Logic design","Logic programming","Process design","Logic circuits","Humans","Joining processes","Circuit synthesis","Expert systems","Productivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert systems","integrated logic circuits","logic CAD","logic programming","software packages","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI logic design","logic programming","knowledge-base technology","structural specifications","behavioral specifications","logic synthesis expert system","ProLogic","object-oriented frames","rule bases"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45836","doi":"10.1109/41.45836","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1731/00045836.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.45836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45836/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI logic design with logic programming and knowledge-base technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3626997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI logic design with logic programming and knowledge-base technology","sourcePdf":"00045836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037525S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"2","articleId":"45836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45837,"authors":[{"name":"S.

First, a real-time narrowband Kalman filter is implemented with a floating-point digital processor DSP32. The real-time capability of this narrowband filter is investigated by varying parameters Q and R. The covariance matrices Q and R of the dynamic and measurement noise sequences are found to exhibit duality in the real-time tuning process and have a direct effect on system stability. If the value of Q used is smaller (with fixed R), the tracking time and the narrower tracking bandwidth of the filter will be longer. In addition, if the value of R used (with fixed Q) is smaller, the tracking time will be smaller, and the tracking bandwidth of the filter will be larger. The results are tabulated. Second, two optimal codes (in the sense of the execution speed), straight-line code and general matrix-based code, have been developed for implementing the narrowband Kalman filter. These two codes are compared in terms of program memory size, data memory size, and speed of execution. With the matrix-based code, the DSP32 performance is evaluated in terms of speed and memory size by varying the number of states of a Kalman filter. The results are also tabulated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.45838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1731/00045838.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.45838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time implementation of a narrow-band Kalman filter with a floating-point processor DSP32","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45838/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time implementation of a narrow-band Kalman filter with a floating-point processor DSP32","volume":"37","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3626998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time implementation of a narrow-band Kalman filter with a floating-point processor DSP32","sourcePdf":"00045838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03023S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"25","articleId":"45838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45842,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

It is shown how a reconfigurable set of processors, called processing elements (PEs), can be arranged in a pipelined configuration to implement these algorithms. The algorithms operate within the partitioned-memory, message-passing architecture of MARS. Three logic simulators-two multiple delay and one unit delay-have been implemented using slightly different configuration of the available PEs. In these simulators, VLSI chips are modeled at the gate level with accurate rise/fall delays assigned to each logic primitive. On-chip memory blocks are modeled functionally and are integrated into the simulation framework. The MARS hardware simulator has been tested on many VLSI chip designs and has demonstrated a speed improvement of about 50 times that of an Amdahl 5870 system running a production-quality software simulator while retaining the accuracy of simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1732/00045853.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware logic simulation system","doi":"10.1109/43.45853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.45853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"A hardware logic simulation system","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3616615","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware logic simulation system","sourcePdf":"00045853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026524S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","articleId":"45853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45854,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The domain of the device model function is partitioned using a 2/sup N/ tree, with smaller partitions where the function is more nonlinear. The function value associated with each corner of each partition is precomputed, and the function is evaluated by a given point by interpolation over the smallest partition that includes that point. This technique has the advantage that highly nonlinear functions can be modeled with modest space and time requirements. Exponential functions, such as the subthreshold behavior of FETs, can be accurately modeled. Accuracy levels of 1% are possible down to currents of 10/sup -11/ A. Table generation time is small; it is only a few minutes for a MOSFET model including subthreshold effects.

For this configuration, a random-access protocol called RATO (random-access time-out) is presented. RATO provides random access, fairness, and bounded delay access to all stations, and is particularly suited for ultra-high-speed transmission when the performance of the popular Ethernet becomes unattractive. Simplicity and ease of hardware implementation of RATO under ultra-high-speed environment is emphasized because the only control requirements are the sensing of activity in the bus and a fixed time delay between consecutive transmissions from the same station. Results of simulation and performance comparisons of RATO with other schemes are given. In ultra-high-speed wide-area networks, RATO outperforms all these other schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1735/00045933.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"89","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.45933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.45933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RATO-net: a random-access protocol for unidirectional ultra-high-speed optical fiber network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Bandwidth","Access protocols","Optical fibers","Optical fiber cables","Videoconference","Wide area networks","Air traffic control","Manufacturing automation","Spaceborne radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed optical techniques","optical fibres","optical logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bus activity sensing","RATO-net","random-access protocol","unidirectional ultra-high-speed optical fiber network","network medium","unidirectional fiber optic buses","passive taps","random-access time-out","bounded delay access","ultra-high-speed transmission","Ethernet","control requirements","fixed time delay","consecutive transmissions","wide-area networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"RATO-net: a random-access protocol for unidirectional ultra-high-speed optical fiber network","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3628272","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RATO-net: a random-access protocol for unidirectional ultra-high-speed optical fiber network","sourcePdf":"00045933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056615S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","articleId":"45933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":45936,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The validity of normalization by saturation input power is confirmed by experimental data. This normalized input power must be set below -20 and -10 dB for multiwavelength numbers of 20 and 4, respectively, to attain an average interchannel crosstalk of under -10 dB. The optical loss, including interchannel crosstalk, that can be compensated by a traveling-wave-type semiconductor laser amplifier (TWA) is analyzed. The experimental results indicate that the compensable optical loss could be evaluated by using the average interchannel crosstalk in multiwavelength transmission system design. Applying a TWA as a preamplifier is more effective in systems that include excess optical loss in the receiver.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.45936","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1735/00045936.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"112","doi":"10.1109/50.45936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of a traveling-wave-type semiconductor laser amplifier as a booster in multiwavelength simultaneous amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"The performance of a traveling-wave-type semiconductor laser amplifier as a booster in multiwavelength simultaneous amplification","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3628275","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of a traveling-wave-type semiconductor laser amplifier as a booster in multiwavelength simultaneous amplification","sourcePdf":"00045936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030231S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","articleId":"45936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":45950,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.C. van Gemert","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Program, University of Texas, Austin, USA","Laser Centre, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"firstName":"M.J.C.","lastName":"van Gemert","id":"37870043700"},{"name":"A.J.

The general approach is to create different software modules that detect the presence or absence of critical features. Image analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as the use of heuristics incorporated into image processing algorithms, is the primary approach. On a broad scale, this research addressed the problem of segmentation of a digital image based on color information. The algorithm that was developed to segment the image strictly on the basis of color information was shown to be a useful aid in the identification of tumor border, ulcer, and other features of interest. As a specific application example, the method was applied to 200 digitized skin tumor images to identify the feature called variegated coloring. Extensive background information is provided, and the development of the algorithm is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/1736/00045955.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"50","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doi":"10.1109/51.45955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.45955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic color segmentation of images with application to detection of variegated coloring in skin tumors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Skin neoplasms","Cancer","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Artificial intelligence","Diagnostic expert systems","Software systems","Computer errors","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["colour","computer vision","expert systems","medical diagnostic computing","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variegated colouring detection","digital image segmentation","automatic colour segmentation","artificial intelligence techniques","skin tumors","computer vision system","medical expert system","visual feature identification","software modules","critical features","image processing algorithms","ulcer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Automatic color segmentation of images with application to detection of variegated coloring in skin tumors","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3639941","pubMedId":"18244093","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic color segmentation of images with application to detection of variegated coloring in skin tumors","sourcePdf":"00045955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040163S","chronDate":"Dec.  1989","isNumber":"1736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"65","articleId":"45955","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45968,"authors":[{"name":"G.-K.

Some experimental results that illustrate the details of the study are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3631995","displayDocTitle":"A study of active power filters using quad-series voltage-source PWM converters for harmonic compensation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of active power filters using quad-series voltage-source PWM converters for harmonic compensation","sourcePdf":"00045994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040237S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"190","articleId":"45994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":45996,"authors":[{"name":"T.

First, the discretized state equations of the inverter main circuit on the d-q frame are derived. An algorithm for dead beat control with a current minor loop that constrains the inverter current within the safety limit is subsequently developed. To compensate the computing time delay, a second-order prediction method and a novel discretization method using twice the time of the sampling period have been adopted. This method is especially suitable for inverters using high-speed switching devices and digital signal processors. The validity of the control system has been demonstrated by precise simulation using a hybrid computer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/1740/00045996.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.45996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.45996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=45996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dead beat control of three phase PWM inverter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Microprocessors","Pulse inverters","Equations","Circuits","Signal processing algorithms","Safety","Delay effects","Prediction methods","Signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised control","invertors","microcomputer applications","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadbeat control","three phase PWM inverter","microprocessor control","sinusoidal-voltage","discretized state equations","d-q frame","dead beat control","second-order prediction method","high-speed switching devices","digital signal processors","control system","simulation","hybrid computer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/45996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Dead beat control of three phase PWM inverter","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3643147","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dead beat control of three phase PWM inverter","sourcePdf":"00045996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031551S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"211","articleId":"45996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":45998,"authors":[{"name":"V.J.

At lambda /sub opt/, high gains ranging from 32 dB at pump power P/sub p/=20 mW up to 40 dB at P/sub p/=80 mW were obtained. These modest pump powers are within the capabilities of currently available 1.48- mu m diode lasers. The width about lambda /sub opt/ for 3-dB gain variation exceeded 27 nm for P/sub p/=10 mW and 40 nm for P/sub p/>20 mW.

Processing nodes on the periphery of an H-mesh are first wrapped around to achieve regularity and homogeneity. The diameter of a wrapped H-mesh is shown to be of O(p/sup 1/2/), where p is the number of nodes in the H-mesh. An elegant, distributed routing scheme is developed for wrapped H-meshes so that each node in an H-mesh can compute shortest paths from itself to any other node with a straightforward algorithm of O(1) using the addresses of the source-destination pair only, i.e. independent of the network's size. This is in sharp contrast with those previously known algorithms that rely on using routing tables. Furthermore, the authors also develop an efficient point-to-point broadcasting algorithm for the H-meshes which is proved to be optimal in the number of required communication steps. The wrapped H-meshes are compared against some other existing multiprocessor interconnection networks, such as hypercubes, trees, and square meshes. The comparison reinforces the attractiveness of the H-mesh architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.46277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"10","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1749/00046277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.46277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Addressing, routing, and broadcasting in hexagonal mesh multiprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Broadcasting","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Wrapping","Intelligent networks","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Tree graphs","Message passing","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","multiprocessor interconnection networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["addressing","routing","broadcasting","hexagonal mesh multiprocessors","six-regular graphs","H-meshes","multiprocessor interconnection network","hypercubes","trees","square meshes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"Addressing, routing, and broadcasting in hexagonal mesh multiprocessors","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3618508","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46277/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Addressing, routing, and broadcasting in hexagonal mesh multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"00046277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031427S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"132","articleId":"46277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":46279,"authors":[{"name":"P.R.

The buffer assignment problem is formulated as an integer linear optimization problem that can be solved in pseudopolynomial time. However, if the size of an ADFG increases, then integer linear constraint equations may grow exponentially, making the optimization problem more intractable. The decomposition approach utilizes the critical path concept to decompose a directed ADFG into a set of connected subgraphs, and the integer linear optimization technique can be used to solve the buffer assignment problem in each subgraph. Thus, a large-scale integer linear optimization problem is divided into a number of smaller-scale subproblems, each of which can be easily solved in pseudopolynomial time. Examples are given to illustrate the proposed decomposition technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Flow graphs","Data flow computing","Very large scale integration","Systolic arrays","Physics computing","Delay","Pipeline processing","Robots","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decomposition approach","balancing large-scale acyclic data flow graphs","optimal buffer assignment problem","integer linear optimization problem","pseudopolynomial time","integer linear constraint equations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/12.46279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1749/00046279.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.46279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decomposition approach for balancing large-scale acyclic data flow graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=46279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A decomposition approach for balancing large-scale acyclic data flow graphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46279/","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3618510","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decomposition approach for balancing large-scale acyclic data flow graphs","sourcePdf":"00046279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036219S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"13","articleId":"46279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":46283,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Such number representation systems possess sufficient redundancy to allow for the annihilation of carry or borrow chains and hence result in fast propagation-free addition and subtraction. The author refers to the above as ordinary SD number systems and defines generalized SD number systems which contain them as a special symmetric subclass. It is shown that the generalization not only provides a unified view of all redundant number systems which have proven useful in practice (including stored-carry and stored-borrowed systems), but also leads to new number systems not examined before. Examples of such new number systems are stored-carry-or-borrow systems, stored-double-carry systems, and certain redundant decimal representations.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/12.46283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1749/00046283.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.46283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized signed-digit number systems: a unifying framework for redundant number representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"Generalized signed-digit number systems: a unifying framework for redundant number representations","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3618514","volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized signed-digit number systems: a unifying framework for redundant number representations","sourcePdf":"00046283.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027663S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"115","articleId":"46283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":46286,"authors":[{"name":"S.

With this definition, which is shown to be consistent with that for analog systems, it follows that the ENBW is bounded by the smaller of the analog ENBW or half the sampling frequency.

The results are plotted for degrees of freedom and show that there is considerable improvement in the phase modulation (PM) noise compared with the results for tau -overlap sampling, because of an increased number of tau -averaged frequency samples to be obtained from the time data.

It is possible to work exclusively in the load plane, as the input-matching requirement makes the source admittance dependent on the load admittance. As a consequence of the bilinear transformation involved, all parameters may be presented by circles. Analytic equations giving the centers and the radii of the circles in the load plane are presented. Two kinds of amplifier configurations are considered: a single-stage amplifier with an input-match requirement and a two-stage cascade amplifier. The latter is required to have an output match and noise-optimized second stage, in addition to an input match. For the single-stage case the noise figure, the power gain, the stability, and the input network are treated. In the cascade design, the total noise figure, the interstage network, and the available gain are treated as well.

The solution associated with this integral formulation appears to behave better than the others, in comparison with the exact analytical solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.46428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"178","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.46428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1753","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1753/00046428.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tellurium","Integral equations","Electromagnetic scattering","Polarization","Gradient methods","Nonuniform electric fields","Dielectric losses","Kernel","Diffraction","Biomedical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transverse electric polarisation","2D objects","EM wave scattering","integral formulations","TE scattering problem","internal field distribution","generalized functions","inhomogeneous dissipative cylinders","electromagnetic parameters","biological tissues"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of three integral formulations for the 2-D TE scattering problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46428/","volume":"38","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3629257","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of three integral formulations for the 2-D TE scattering problem","sourcePdf":"00046428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037882S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"23","articleId":"46428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":46431,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An illustrative example in which this is applied to a typical field measurement is followed by an investigation into the capabilities and limitations of the algorithm. A statistical analysis of the method has been carried out using a database of laboratory measurements. The Prony algorithm's ability to resolve delays to better than half the Fourier limit is shown, and its tendency to yield biased estimates is studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.46507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1756/00046507.pdf","endPage":"1143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An autoregressive approach to the identification of multipath ray parameters from field measurements","doi":"10.1109/26.46507","startPage":"1136","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=46507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"An autoregressive approach to the identification of multipath ray parameters from field measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46507/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606621","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An autoregressive approach to the identification of multipath ray parameters from field measurements","sourcePdf":"00046507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036933S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","articleId":"46507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":46508,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

A simple form of MD is the carrier phase exp(j theta ), which has to be estimated and compensated for in a coherent receiver. A more general case with fading must, however, allow for amplitude as well as phase variations of the MD. The authors assume a state-variable model for the MD and generally obtain a nonlinear estimation problem with additional randomly varying system parameters such as received signal power, frequency offset, and Doppler spread.

For implementation, all variables must be confined to a finite range. The following properties of the Viterbi algorithm can be exploited for this purpose: (1) path selection depends only on differences of metrics; an (2) the difference between metrics is bounded. In the rescaling scheme, at each iteration the minimum metric is subtracted from all metrics. The use of two's complement arithmetic is proposed as an alternative to the rescaling method. This scheme avoids any kind of rescaling subtractions. Obvious advantages in implementation are hardware savings and a speedup inside the metric update loop, which is critical to the decoder's computational throughput.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","volume":"37","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606630","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An alternative to metric rescaling in Viterbi decoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative to metric rescaling in Viterbi decoders","sourcePdf":"00046516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074854S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"113","articleId":"46516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":46520,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The high degree of inherent parallelism makes a parallel-processing implementation attractive. The algorithm is shown to exhibit an error-rate versus average-computational-complexity behavior that is much superior to the Viterbi algorithm and also improves on the M-algorithm. The decoding algorithm maintains a variable number of paths as its computation adapts to the channel noise actually encountered. Buffering of received samples is required to support this. Bounds that are evaluated by trellis search are produced for the error event rate and average number of survivors. Performance is evaluated with conventional binary convolutional codes over both binary-synchronous-communication (BSC) and additive-white-Gaussian-noise (AWGN) channels. Performance is also found for multilevel AM and phase-shift-keying (PSK) codes and simple intersymbol interference responses over an AWGN channel. At lower signal-to-noise ratio Monte Carlo simulations are used to improve on the bounds and to investigate decoder dynamics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","volume":"38","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3629611","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Breadth-first trellis decoding with adaptive effort","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breadth-first trellis decoding with adaptive effort","sourcePdf":"00046522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022427S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"198","articleId":"46522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":46523,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

System performance on time-dispersive channels with nulls as well as on channels with relatively small intersymbol interference is investigated. A reference insertion method is used to improve system performance, and a two-stage processing technique is adopted to use the more reliable decisions from the decoder in equalizer coefficient adaptation.

LAN protocols for networks incorporating atmospheric optical communications should be modified to best insulate users from the occasional error bursts and bad-weather outages suffered by such links.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An atmospheric optical ring network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.46531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1757/00046531.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00046531.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.46531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1757","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=46531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1990","displayDocTitle":"An atmospheric optical ring network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629620","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An atmospheric optical ring network","sourcePdf":"00046531.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0436S","chronDate":"Jan 1990","isNumber":"1757","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"46531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":46532,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The theoretical justification for the approach is alphabet-constrained rate distortion theory, which is a dual to the channel capacity argument that motivates trellis-coded modulation (TCM). The authors adopt the notions of signal set expansion, set partitioning, and branch labeling of TCM, but modify the techniques to account for the source distribution, to design TCQ coders of low complexity with excellent mean-squared-error (MSE) performance. For a memoryless uniform source, TCQ provides an MSE within 0.21 dB of the distortion-rate bound at all positive (integral) rates. The performance is superior to that promised by the coefficient of quantization for all of the best lattices known in dimensions 24 or less. For a memoryless Gaussian source, the TCQ performance at rates of 0.5, 1, and 2 b/sample is superior to all previous results the authors found in the literature. The encoding complexity of TCQ is very modest. TCQ is incorporated into a predictive coding structure for the encoding of Gauss-Markov sources.

The authors focus on the speech cepstrum derived from linear prediction coefficients (the LPC cepstrum). By using some common models for noisy speech, they show analytically that additive white noise reduces the norm (length) of the LPC cepstral vectors. Empirical observations on the parameter histograms not only confirm the analytical results through the use of noise models but further reveal that at a given (global) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the norm reduction on cepstral vectors with larger norms is generally less than on vectors with smaller norms, and that lower order coefficients are more affected than higher order terms. In addition, it is found that the orientation (or direction) of the cepstral vector is less susceptible to noise perturbation than the vector norm. As a consequence of the above results, a family of distortion measures based on the projection between two cepstral vectors is proposed. The new measures have the same computational efficiency as the band-pass cepstral distortion measure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.46548","startPage":"1659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1758/00046548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.46548","endPage":"1671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A family of distortion measures based upon projection operation for robust speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"A family of distortion measures based upon projection operation for robust speech recognition","volume":"37","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3618900","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A family of distortion measures based upon projection operation for robust speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00046548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034831S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"109","articleId":"46548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":46553,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The results are applied to a statistical efficiency analysis of the main frequency estimation methods based on eigenvalue decomposition. For the covariance matrix, in order to characterize the perturbation of the signal subspace, only the component of the perturbation of the eigenvectors orthogonal to the subspace is considered. This gives a simpler and more significant form of the error covariance. The treatment includes the cases of forward-backward and moving averages. The CRB and estimation variances are calculated in the presence of additive random noise, but for a given set of amplitudes characterized by their sample covariance matrix. This approach is more realistic for the evaluation of efficiency in the small-sample case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1758/00046553.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.46553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.46553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=46553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of high resolution frequencies estimation methods compared to the Cramer-Rao bounds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Covariance matrix","Signal resolution","Additive noise","Signal processing","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Amplitude estimation","Noise level","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","parameter estimation","signal processing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","moving average","forward-backward average","Cramer-Rao bounds","statistical perturbation","covariance matrix","additive noise","statistical efficiency analysis","frequency estimation methods","eigenvalue decomposition","signal subspace","error covariance","additive random noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Performance of high resolution frequencies estimation methods compared to the Cramer-Rao bounds","volume":"37","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","accessionNumber":"3618904","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of high resolution frequencies estimation methods compared to the Cramer-Rao bounds","sourcePdf":"00046553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115997S","chronDate":"Nov 1989","isNumber":"1758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"83","articleId":"46553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":46554,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Adaptive equalization is attractive since it permits a significant reduction in manufacturing costs by allowing a greater component yield due to relaxed tolerances and also permits a reduction in servicing costs because of a reduced need for fine-tuning on the customer's premises. The differences between data storage and data transmission channels are examined. The storage channel's important signal-processing characteristics are described, covering read and write processes, detection methods, and various types of distortion that can occur in storage channels. The use of signal-to-noise ratio as a performance measure is considered. Equalization methods for peak detection and for sampling detection are discussed. Gains in both linear and areal (track) density are addressed. Some of the basic performance advantages of using adaptive equalization are illustrated.

It is shown that, in practice, the inversion of the magnetostatic dipole field or field gradient is a necessary first step toward determining object location and identity. Several iterative and noniterative methods of determinating the dipole moment and location from field or gradient measurements are described and compared. It is shown that, given the dipole-moment estimates, it is possible to determine the identity of the dipole source in practical situations by pattern recognition. A unique prototype total field magnetometer which is capable of explicitly and accurately locating and identifying axially symmetric compact ferrous objects is described.

A convex grid is a subset R of the planar rectangular grid without any nontrivial holes, i.e. every finite face has exactly four incident vertices, so that every vertical and horizontal line crosses the boundary of the grid at most twice. A net is a pair of vertices of nonmaximal degree on the boundary of A. A solution of the problem is a set of edge-disjoint paths, one for each net. The vertices of a net are called its terminals. The algorithm is based on a theorem of H. Okamura and P.D. Seymour (J. Combinatorial Theory, vol.31, series B., p.75-81, 1981) on multicommodity flows in a planar graphs. The algorithm is very simple, uses only one simple data structure and works in time O(n) on a more general routing region.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3626669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A linear-time algorithm for routing in a convex grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear-time algorithm for routing in a convex grid","sourcePdf":"00046784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046441S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"11","articleId":"46784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":46787,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The authors have delimited, for every reconvergent fan-out stem, a region of the circuit outside of which the stem fault does not have to be simulated. Lines on the boundary of such a stem region, called exit lines, have the following property: if the stem fault is detected on the line and the line is critical with respect to a primary output, then the stem fault is detected at that primary output. Any fault simulation technique can be used to simulate the stem fault within its stem region. The fault simulation complexity of a circuit is shown to be directly related to the number and size of stem regions in the circuit. The concept of stem regions has been used as a framework for an efficient fault simulator for combinational circuits. The concept allows a static reduction of the circuit area of explicit analysis for single- as well as multiple-output circuits. A dynamic reduction of processing steps is also achieved as the fault simulation progresses and fault coverage increases. The simulation algorithm is described, and experimental results are shown for the well-known benchmark circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.46788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1770/00046788.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.46788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of fault simulation based on stem regions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=46788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46788/","displayDocTitle":"A method of fault simulation based on stem regions","volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3626673","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of fault simulation based on stem regions","sourcePdf":"00046788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041722S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"60","articleId":"46788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":46798,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Testing for delay faults has the goal of detecting a large fraction of these faults for a wide range of fault sizes. Hence, an evaluation scheme for a delay fault test must not only compute whether or not a delay fault was detected, but also calculate the sizes of detected delay faults. Delay faults have the counterintuitive property that a test for a fault of one size need not be a test for a similar fault of a larger size. This makes it difficult to answer questions about the sizes of delay faults detected by a set of tests. A model for delay faults that answers such questions correctly, but with calculations simple enough to be done for large circuits, is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.46805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1771/00046805.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.46805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On computing the sizes of detected delay faults","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=46805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46805/","displayDocTitle":"On computing the sizes of detected delay faults","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3638926","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On computing the sizes of detected delay faults","sourcePdf":"00046805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040174S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"83","articleId":"46805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":46807,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Kang Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fudan University, China"],"lastName":"Wei Kang Huang","id":"37345823800"},{"name":"Yi-Nan Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Yi-Nan Shen","id":"37346471600"},{"name":"F.

These devices, referred to as redundant RAMs, are repaired to achieve acceptable yield at manufacturing and production times. The first approach, the faulty line covering technique, is a refinement of the fault-driven approach. This approach finds the optimal repair solution within a smaller number of iterations than the fault-driven algorithm. The second approach exploits a heuristic criterion in the generation of the repair solution. This heuristic criterion permits a fast repair. The criterion is based on the calculation of efficient coefficients for the rows and columns of the memory. Simulation results are presented. Comparison of the proposed heuristic approaches with the fully exhaustive approach shows that repair can be accomplished in most cases. A considerable reduction in processing and complexity (number of records generated in the repair process for finding the optimal repair solution) is accomplished.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.46807","startPage":"323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1771/00046807.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.46807","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New approaches for the repairs of memories with redundancy by row/column deletion for yield enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"New approaches for the repairs of memories with redundancy by row/column deletion for yield enhancement","volume":"9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3638928","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New approaches for the repairs of memories with redundancy by row/column deletion for yield enhancement","sourcePdf":"00046807.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079592S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"65","articleId":"46807","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":46830,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

First, the regression models are formed from the raw complexity metrics. Essentially, these models confirm a known relationship between program lines of code and program errors. The second methodology involves the regression of complexity factor measures and measures of errors. These complexity factors are orthogonal measures of complexity from an underlying complexity domain model. From this more global perspective, it is believed that there is a relationship between program errors and complexity domains of program structure and size (volume). Further, the strength of this relationship suggests that predictive models are indeed possible for the determination of program errors from these orthogonal complexity domains.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.46879","startPage":"253","endPage":"261","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1775/00046879.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.46879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting software development errors using software complexity metrics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Computer errors","Software metrics","Predictive models","Software measurement","Testing","Computer science","Software reliability","Parameter estimation","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality control","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["errors prediction","program size","program volume","software development errors","software complexity metrics","program error measures","factor analysis","empirical data","regression models","regression analysis","complexity factors","orthogonal measures","program structure","predictive models","orthogonal complexity domains"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/46879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Predicting software development errors using software complexity metrics","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3640153","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting software development errors using software complexity metrics","sourcePdf":"00046879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022466S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"154","articleId":"46879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":46919,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

Intrinsic device properties are discussed in terms of MC electron and hole transport under low illumination intensity. Parasitic circuit elements are then introduced to more closely model realistic devices using the MC results in a circuit simulator. Intrinsic devices with 0.5- and 1.0- mu m spacing between fingers are dominated by stationary high-field transport. Surprisingly, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.5- and 1.0- mu m detectors with parasitics is 4.3 and 3.8 ps, respectively. However, the 1- mu m detector exhibits a long hole tail and transient oscillations. Thus, FWHM results (and intrinsic device response) can be inadequate predictors of ultimate frequency response and scaling behavior. However, an estimate of maximum repetition frequency gives f/sub max/=92 GHz for the 0.5 mu m device, consistent with experimental data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.47069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/1786/00047069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.47069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1786","startPage":"125","endPage":"127","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00047069.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrinsic and extrinsic response of GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=47069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intrinsic and extrinsic response of GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47069/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3633510","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrinsic and extrinsic response of GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors","sourcePdf":"00047069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03017S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"23","articleId":"47069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":47144,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Here the MPP processor limits neuron connections somewhat, but all MPP processors are active at all times and a large speedup is obtained. The first simulation, based on mathematics (weight matrix), produces a significant speedup but tends to obscure the second faster simulation based on mapping the physics (entire physical description) of the neural network onto the MPP.

The neural network is implemented on a systolic array processor based on the Geometric Arithmetic Parallel Processor (GAPP) chip. Arrays of GAPP chips make up a single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) class machine which has fine-grained connections and is fully programmable. Previous application areas of the GAPP system are image/signal processing, computer vision, and knowledge-based processing. The neural network is a relatively new processing model for the GAPP, but one that readily maps onto the architecture of the overall array processor. The proof-of-concept neural network is a multilayered perceptron model which uses the back-propagation learning paradigm. This initial network has fewer than 100 nodes in three layers and is trained to recognize letters of the alphabet.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47411/","accessionNumber":"3532227","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network on a SIMD architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network on a SIMD architecture","confLoc":"Fairfax, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00047411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03343S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct 1988","isNumber":"1792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"475","citationCount":"8","articleId":"47411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":47422,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

Furthermore, each cell in the design is simple, fine-grain (8-b), and to be implemented with high latency circuits (3M200 ns). These hardware limitations are exploited through massive parallelism at the instruction level and the algorithm level.

Worst-case, or extremal fault tolerance, is used as a basic metric for any redundant system. Two schemes are examined: a traditional dedicated spares model in which spare rows and columns cover rows and columns with faults, and a homogeneous model in which every row and column is a spare. In both cases deciding the existence of a fault cover is NP-complete, thus providing impetus for the extremal (i.e. worst-case) approach. With dedicated spares the extremal fault tolerance is just the number of spares; within this number of faults, a cover is constructed in time proportional to the dimensions of the array. Finding the homogeneous extremal fault tolerance is equivalent to the problem in which the number of spares does not exceed the dimension of the desired usable array. Within this number of faults, a repair is found in time proportional to the size of the array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Jan 1989","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3406457","displayDocTitle":"Extremally fault tolerant arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extremally fault tolerant arrays","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00047567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031432S","chronDate":"3-5 Jan 1989","isNumber":"1793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"492","citationCount":"12","articleId":"47567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":47582,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

The authors examine the charge storage capacity in a 1-T DRAM cell and analyze a number of ferroelectric materials for their potential use as the dielectric in 64-Mb and 256-Mb DRAM capacitors, focusing on projected requirements for the electrical parameters and preferred material characteristics. Of the materials examined, those that appear to hold the greatest promise for 64-Mb and 256-Mb DRAMs are the paraelectric phase compositions of (Pb,La)TiO/sub 3/ (PLT) and (Pb,La)(Zr,Ti)O/sub 3/ (PLZT). Pb(Mg,Nb)O/sub 3/ (PMN) is also attractive because it is paraelectric, but it may not be able to achieve the required charge densities when deposited as a thin film.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606966","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ferroelectric materials for 64 Mb and 256 Mb DRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferroelectric materials for 64 Mb and 256 Mb DRAMs","sourcePdf":"00047582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112171S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"1794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"101","citationCount":"256","articleId":"47582","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":47614,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

Typical digital range-Doppler processing operations are described, utilizing two spectral estimation techniques. Quality ISAR images have been obtained from such processing, and particular examples, which are based on simulated data generated from point-target models of rotating objects, are shown. The first example is a so-called merry-go-round of 24 point-targets, and the MLM (maximum-likelihood method) algorithm is utilized to process a 3-D range-Doppler image estimate. The second example is a rotating boom along which are located 15 point-targets including a doublet, a triplet, and a quadruplet cluster that require superresolution techniques to resolve in the Doppler domain. It is concluded that superresolution techniques offer a viable alternative to conventional DFT (discrete Fourier transform) ISAR image processing and should permit either higher resolution images from the same data samples or equal-quality images from significantly fewer data samples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NRC.1989.47614","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE National Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE National Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/810/1796/00047614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRC.1989.47614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1796","startPage":"48","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superresolution techniques and ISAR imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=47614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Superresolution techniques and ISAR imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47614/","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3439793","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superresolution techniques and ISAR imaging","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00047614.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044473S","chronDate":"29-30 Mar 1989","isNumber":"1796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"810","citationCount":"10","articleId":"47614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":47616,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

Average probabilities of correct classification of 70% to 90% have been found when testing the classifier on recorded radar data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47635/","accessionNumber":"3439812","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29-30 March 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A statistical radar clutter classifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical radar clutter classifier","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00047635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033612S","chronDate":"29-30 Mar 1989","isNumber":"1796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"810","citationCount":"9","articleId":"47635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":47763,"authors":[{"name":"N.Z.

The measurement of the noise-power spectral density can be performed readily on any resettable charge-detection node, and the derived formula, therefore, becomes a useful tool for device characterization and testing. The accuracy of the derived theoretical predictions is verified by making comparisons with the measured noise performance of a typical CCD image sensor. Finally, the usefulness of the results obtained from the analysis is demonstrated by identifying an unwanted noise source in the design of a particular CCD charge-detection circuit.

The latter is attributed to the Coulombic scattering effect of the fluctuating oxide charge. The model has a functional form resembling that of the number fluctuation theory, but at certain bias conditions it may reduce to a form compatible with Hooge's empirical expression. The model can unify the noise data reported in the literature, without making any ad hoc assumption on the noise generation mechanism. Specifically, the model can predict the right magnitude and bias dependence of the empirical Hooge parameter. Simulated flicker noise characteristics obtained with a circuit-simulation-oriented flicker noise model based on the new formulation were compared with experimental noise data. Excellent agreement between the calculations and measurement was observed in both the linear and saturation regions for MOS transistors fabricated by different technologies. The work shows that the flicker noise in MOS transistors can be completely explained by the trap charge fluctuation mechanism, which produces mobile carrier number fluctuation and correlated surface mobility fluctuation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3629153","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A unified model for the flicker noise in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified model for the flicker noise in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors","sourcePdf":"00047770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042695S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"649","articleId":"47770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":47780,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By eliminating completely the structural interferences between bit line and plate electrode, the storage-node pattern is maximized. The STC cell also features low noise characteristics due to its shielded bit-line structure. This minimizes the interbit-line capacitance to below 1% of the bit-line capacitance in the memory array. The average charge retention time, measured using an experimental 2-kb array, is 30 s at 40 degrees C.

The theory is based on a composition law that allows the calculation of the gain distribution of a multilayer structure from the known distributions for each layer. The composition law is used to establish some well-known results and a number of new results. New formulas are derived for the gain and excess noise of a general double-carrier structure composed of multiple identical stages. A set of differential equations is derived for the case of continuous multiplication, as in a conventional APD. New results are reported for the noise of the staircase APD and for an APD with two regions of constant but different ionization ratios.

A key figure of merit is eta , the efficiency with which channels can be packed into a given bandwidth relative to the ideal packing of 100% corresponding to abutting channels (channel spacing=channel bandwidth). Packing can be severely limited by intermodulation distortion due to inherent amplifier nonlinearity. Assuming constant envelope signaling, the authors use a recently developed amplifier model to show that, by employing practical coding methods, eta can be greatly increased. A simple, general algebraic formula for eta is derived in terms of amplifier, receiver, and code parameters. For illustrative purposes the authors consider the packing of 50-Mb/s channels into a 1-THz optical bandwidth, assuming typical amplifier and receiver parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.47853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1802/00047853.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"191","doi":"10.1109/26.47853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming optical amplifier intermodulation distortion using coding in multichannel communications systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming optical amplifier intermodulation distortion using coding in multichannel communications systems","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629639","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming optical amplifier intermodulation distortion using coding in multichannel communications systems","sourcePdf":"00047853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042005S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","articleId":"47853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":47855,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

All fields have to be reconstructed at the receiver end, but nearest-neighbor or linear interpolations give poor performances when significant scene activity is present; therefore, some motion compensation scheme is mandatory. Although any of the algorithms proposed for motion estimation can be used for motion compensated interpolation, in this paper only the pel-recursive algorithm is considered. Past experience is briefly summarized and, based on criticism, improvements to the basic algorithm are proposed that seem to lead to an estimated motion field that is accurate enough. Multiple recursions and appropriate selection rules are proposed to counteract streaking effects of the recursive algorithm when it crosses image boundaries. The estimation of a forward and a backward motion field is used to identify image areas where occlusion effects are present. Experimental results are presented that seem to indicate that the proposed interpolation scheme has good performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensated image interpolation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.47856","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1802/00047856.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.47856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=47856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensated image interpolation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629642","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensated image interpolation","sourcePdf":"00047856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030139S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","articleId":"47856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":47859,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Both the carrier-frequency offset and code-frequency offset due to severe Doppler effect are considered. The code-chip slipping during the correlation process caused by code-frequency offset can degrade the acquisition performance significantly. However, this issue can be alleviated by compensating code-frequency offset in an appropriate manner. Results are presented for the cases with and without data modulation. Coherent detection is considered when there is no data modulation. If data modulation is present, the authors partition the correlation time into subintervals and the integration results in these subintervals are square-law noncoherently combined for detection. The implementation of this code acquisition technique using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is described. The use of theoretical results to estimate the hardware complexity of an actual system is illustrated step by step, showing that implementation is feasible with existing technology. The tradeoff between hardware complexity and acquisition performance is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1802/00047859.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.47859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.47859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=47859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread-spectrum code acquisition in the presence of Doppler shift and data modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Doppler shift","Modulation coding","Space technology","Doppler effect","Degradation","Hardware","Frequency synchronization","Propulsion","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","Doppler effect","fast Fourier transforms","modulation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation time partitioning","coherent detection","direct-sequence system","subintervals integration results","Doppler shift","data modulation","spread-spectrum code acquisition technique","carrier-frequency offset","code-frequency offset","correlation process","square-law noncoherently combined","fast Fourier transform","FFT","hardware complexity","acquisition performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/47859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1990","displayDocTitle":"Spread-spectrum code acquisition in the presence of Doppler shift and data modulation","volume":"38","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3629645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread-spectrum code acquisition in the presence of Doppler shift and data modulation","sourcePdf":"00047859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039052S","chronDate":"Feb 1990","isNumber":"1802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"86","articleId":"47859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":47871,"authors":[{"name":"K.

They present a frame interline transfer CCD image sensor (FIT CCD), with 1258(H)*1035(V) pixels, that uses a poly-Si/Al double-layer transfer gate and p/sup +/-floating-island isolation. The saturation current of the present FIT CCD is 900 nA up to 625 kHz, whereas that of the conventional FIT CCD is fairly poor even at 300 kHz. The high transfer speed results from reduction of gate resistance. The photoconversion characteristics measured at a transfer frequency of 625 kHz show that the sensitivity reaches 50 nA/lx. The measured characteristics of the image sensor meet practical HDTV three-chip camera requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1989 ISSCC.

The imager, which stores photocarriers in the base regions of the bipolar transistor pixels, is called the base-stored image sensor (BASIS). BASIS-type devices have been faced with three problems: (1) a reset transistor is needed in each pixel to initialize base voltage; (2) nonuniformity of offset voltage appears as fixed pattern noise; and (3) blooming is induced by intense light. Effective methods of dealing with these problems have been found. A BASIS imager with 310 k pixels in a 2/3-in optical format is described.

The main features are a programming technique appropriate to the NAND structured cell and a dynamic sense amplifier. The NAND structured cell arranges 8 bits in series, sandwiched between two select transistors. The first transistor ensures selectivity; the second prevents the current from passing during programming operation. The current cell has one select transistor per bit. However, the NAND structure has only two select transistors per 8 bits; therefore it has only 1/4 select transistor and 1/16 contact hole per bit. Thus, the NAND structure can realize a smaller cell area than that of the current cell. For high-speed programming, a page mode is adopted. In read operation, address transition detection circuitry is used to precharge the bit lines and reset the read control circuitry. A summary of design characteristics is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1989.48209","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1989 ISSCC.

Erase and programming operations are internally controlled by a timer that is stabilized against temperature and voltage supply variations. Addresses and data are latched during program and erase operations. Internal pumps generate the high voltage for the erase operation.

To obtain 8-b fast conversion, the ADC uses a sample-and-hold comparator with an averaging feature for differential linearity for high-speed sampling and high-frequency inputs and an expanded fine comparison to increase conversion speed. The block diagram of the converter is shown together with two techniques employed to increase conversion speed. The DC linearity of the converter at a 40-MHz conversion rate is shown. The limit of differential linearity is less than +or-0.5 least significant bit for 8 b. The measured power consumption as a function of sampling frequency and supply voltage is also shown. For 40-MHz sampled at a supply voltage of 5 V, the power consumed is 105 mW. For 14.3-MHz sampling at 3.5 V, the consumption drop to 27 mW.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1989 ISSCC.

Using CMOS inputs, power dissipation is 40 mW in the active state and 20 mu W in standby. The memory electrically erases in 900 ms and programs at the rate of 10 mu s/byte. The device contains thirty-two columns of redundant elements and utilizes flash memory cells to store the address of repaired columns. The memory was fabricated on a 1- mu m double-poly n-well CMOS process. A typical cell erase/program V/sub t/ margin is shown as a function of the number of reprogramming cycles.

The four-pole filter is modeled on two L-C resonators coupled by mutual inductance, resistively terminated at the input and output for maximum power transfer. Each resonator is simulated on the IC by two tunable integrators in negative feedback and is terminated by MOS resistors to define the filter bandwidth. Regulation of f/sub 0/ is obtained by locking an oscillating, consisting of a third identical integrator pair without termination resistors, to an externally supplied reference frequency. The circuits were fabricated on a double-metal, single-polysilicon, 3- mu m CMOS IC. Operation of the chip at a 12.5-MHz center frequency was verified, showing the desired 2% fractional bandwidth.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1989.48258","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1989 ISSCC.

It derives all AC characteristics for analog integrated circuits, both continuous-time and switched-capacitor, CMOS and bipolar. The program provides the designer with insight into the circuit behavior by allowing symbolic calculation of transfer functions, common-mode rejection ratio, power-supply rejection ratio, impedances, and noise. The program is based on a symbolic Equation solution that exploits sparse matrix techniques, followed by an heuristic approximation. It is written in Common LISP. The input is a file in SPICE or SWAP format. The output is a rational form in the symbolic circuit parameters and the complex frequency variables s or z. All filter elements are treated as symbolic parameters; the op amps are considered to be ideal. The symbolic filter function is obtained in 0.156 CPU seconds on a 15 MIPS (million instructions per second) LISP machine. ISAAC has been used extensively for the analysis of op amps, active filters, and switched-capacitor circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048261.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1989 ISSCC.

The wafer is essentially a single-ported serial memory device. An innovative concept which utilizes any defective chips free from power failures has made possible a high-yield wafer-scale memory. The wafer includes an array of chips which have a DRAM (dynamic RAM) core and additional control logic known as the configuration logic (Conlog). Each Conlog is connected to its four neighbors by signal lines, which form logic networks on the wafer. An external controller transmits commands to each Conlog element to set up links between chips and configure a single contiguous data path known as a spiral. The spiral is configured on completion of wafer processing by external control software which implements chip test and linking of chips as a single-shaped data-flow chain. The DRAM core and Conlog are designed using a standard 1-Mb DRAM fabricated by the 1.3- mu m CMOS process. The waveform of the internal clock and output of the DRAM are shown as well as the output waveform of the receive terminal of Conlog.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1989.48272","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, 1989 ISSCC.

It features a high-speed latched sensing (LS) scheme and a built-in self-test (BIST) function with a microprogrammable ROM in which automatic test pattern generation procedures are stored by microcoded programs. To achieve 55-ns access time, the DRAM combines the LS scheme with conventional double-Al-layer wiring and 5-V peripheral circuits. The bit-line sense circuits, driven at 3.3 V from an internal voltage converter to ensure 0.6 mu m MOS memory cell reliability, are shown. Both sensing speed and signal voltage are lower at 3.3 V operation than at 5 V operation. However, the LS scheme compensates for these drawbacks and achieves fast access time and high sensitivity.

A new structure is developed which is fully parallel with a speedup factor of 2/sup D+1/ (compared to serial implementation), where D is the delay constraint. Through systematic reformulations of the algorithm, a number of simplifications are performed that avoid the complex and slow computations of exponentials and a large number of multiplications, all at the expense of a small lookup table and a number of simple operations involving additions, comparisons, and table lookups. A number of approximations are applied to this simplified parallel symbol (SPS) detector which lead to the derivation of suboptimal detectors. An interesting suboptimal detector so derived is identical in computations to the Viterbi detector. A comparison of the SPS detector and Viterbi detector shows that the former has a slightly better performance at low values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the latter has a lower complexity at higher values of SNR; otherwise, the two detectors are comparable in performance and complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity parallel-structure symbol-by-symbol detection for ISI channels","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceeding IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1989.48374","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceeding IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/814/1809/00048374.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"353","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048374.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1989.48374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1809","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=48374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity parallel-structure symbol-by-symbol detection for ISI channels","conferenceDate":"1-2 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3567976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity parallel-structure symbol-by-symbol detection for ISI channels","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00048374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047314S","chronDate":"1-2 June 1989","isNumber":"1809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"814","citationCount":"11","articleId":"48374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":48375,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

It is proved that the net is able to perform analog error correction without hanging up at some undesired states-an annoying event that occurs occasionally in Hopfield (1982) nets. The corresponding code is a balanced code which has a significantly higher rate than Hopfield's 1-in-N code. Accordingly, the product of balanced code has a higher rate and better error correcting ability than Hopfield's permutation N*N code. The application of the code to combined modulation and channel coding for a 4-ary channel is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 June 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48418/","accessionNumber":"3577459","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-2 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An error correcting neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An error correcting neural network","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00048418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03613S","chronDate":"1-2 June 1989","isNumber":"1809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"814","citationCount":"4","articleId":"48418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":48446,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

A novel control scheme to minimize the output ripple voltage is suggested and verified through computer simulation, and the effects of the circuit parameters on the output voltage ripple are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1989.48476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1989.48476","startPage":"83","endPage":"90 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/823/1811/00048476.pdf","publicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1811","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048476.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilateral series resonant inverter for high frequency link UPS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral series resonant inverter for high frequency link UPS","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3557067","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48476/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral series resonant inverter for high frequency link UPS","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"00048476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070197S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"823","citationCount":"10","articleId":"48476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":48478,"authors":[{"name":"R.

One method to spread out the harmonic spectrum without the use of programmed PWM (pulse-width modulation) is to cause the switching pattern to be random. It is proposed that the switching pattern can be randomized by modulating the triangle carrier in sinusoidal PWM (pulse-width modulation) with bandlimited white noise. All the advantages of sinusoidal PWM are preserved with this technique. These include real-time control, linear operation, good transient response, and a constant average switching frequency. By controlling the bandwidth and RMS value of the pink noise modulation, it is shown that the instantaneous variation in switching frequency as well as the bandwidth of the energy spectrum in the machine can be specified within predetermined limits. Experimental results show the absence of acoustic noise concentrated at specific tones which is present with conventional sinusoidal modulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1989.48547","publicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"20th Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/823/1811/00048547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1989.48547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1811","startPage":"665","endPage":"671 vol.2","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048547.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic noise reduction in sinusoidal PWM drives using a randomly modulated carrier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=48547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic noise reduction in sinusoidal PWM drives using a randomly modulated carrier","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48547/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3545171","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic noise reduction in sinusoidal PWM drives using a randomly modulated carrier","confLoc":"Milwaukee, WI, USA","sourcePdf":"00048547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028914S","chronDate":"26-29 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"823","citationCount":"31","articleId":"48547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":48548,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It provides a short zero-voltage period in the DC link of the inverter to allow zero-voltage switching to take place in the PWM inverter. The peak voltage stress on the PWM inverter switches is limited to the DC supply voltage. Another significant advantage of the proposed circuit is that the inverter can be controlled by the conventional PWM strategy.

The control task is to make corrections to the motion of the robot that serve to maintain a fixed level of energy (and minimize energy losses), which yields a stable periodic limit cycle in the system's state space. The robot is controlled by the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) with a continuous learning memory. The design and simulation of an autonomous learning apparatus is investigated to devise a strategy for controlling a one-legged hopping robot. Through continuous reinforcement for past successes and failures, the control system develops a stable strategy for accomplishing the desired control objectives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSYSE.1989.48645","pdfPath":"/iel2/844/1812/00048645.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1989 International Conference on Systems Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1989 International Conference on Systems Engineering","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048645.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSYSE.1989.48645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive control of a legged robot using an artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 1989","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of a legged robot using an artificial neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3577987","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of a legged robot using an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Fairborn, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00048645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043228S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 1989","isNumber":"1812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"844","citationCount":"6","articleId":"48645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":48657,"authors":[{"name":"Shaw","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Shaw","id":"37087160407"},{"name":"Manickam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Manickam","id":"37087553118"}],"articleNumber":"48657","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Algorithms","Boltzmann equation","Convergence of numerical methods","Simulation","Iterative methods","Optimization methods","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","algorithm theory","Boltzmann equation","convergence of numerical methods","digital simulation","iterative methods","optimisation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing algorithm","frequency estimation","parameter adaptive coding","Boltzmann distribution","nonlinear optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=48657","abstract":"A simulated annealing scheme based on a parameter adaptive coding schedule is proposed. In the existing annealing schemes, the temperature parameter is predetermined for every iteration step and is independent of the unknown parameter values. In the proposed scheme, the cooling temperature is made proportional to the deviation of each individual parameter at the earlier iteration step. The other key difference in the proposed scheme is that it never accepts a higher energy level and remains at the present lower energy position. Instead, the Boltzmann distribution is used to accept a larger cooling temperature, i.e. a broader parameter search space. The algorithm is then applied to the well-known nonlinear optimization problem of frequency/angles of arrival estimation of multiple sources. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme converges to the minimum energy level in fewer iteration steps when compared to an existing fast annealing algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSYSE.1989.48657","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048657.png","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1989 International Conference on Systems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSYSE.1989.48657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1989 International Conference on Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/844/1812/00048657.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parameter adaptive simulated annealing algorithm for frequency estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48657/","displayDocTitle":"A parameter adaptive simulated annealing algorithm for frequency estimation","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3577998","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parameter adaptive simulated annealing algorithm for frequency estimation","confLoc":"Fairborn, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00048657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0337S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"1812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"844","articleId":"48657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":48672,"authors":[{"name":"Hush","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Hush","id":"37087275314"}],"articleNumber":"48672","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=48672","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Learning systems","Neural networks","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","learning systems","neural nets","pattern recognition","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","neural network classifier","multilayer perceptron","pattern recognition","classification error","computational complexity","sensitivity","training samples","network size","hidden layers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSYSE.1989.48672","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00048672.png","pdfPath":"/iel2/844/1812/00048672.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1989 International Conference on Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1989 International Conference on Systems Engineering","startPage":"277","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSYSE.1989.48672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification with neural networks: a performance analysis","abstract":"A performance analysis is presented for the most popular neural network classifier, the multilayer perceptron (MLP). The analysis is performed for a specific class of pattern recognition problems called one-class classifier problems. The criteria used to measure the performance are classification error, computational complexity (measured in terms of the network size), sensitivity to network size selection, and number of training samples required. With regard to the network size it is shown that networks with one hidden layer perform better than those with two hidden layers. Further, a lower bound on the number of nodes in the hidden layer is derived and found to be d+1, where d is the dimension of the data patterns. The optimal number of nodes is shown to be somewhat larger than this (approximately 3d). In addition the network performance is shown to be relatively insensitive to overspecification of the network size. Finally it is shown that for near-optimal performance the number of training samples should be approximately 60d(d+1).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48672/","accessionNumber":"3578011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification with neural networks: a performance analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification with neural networks: a performance analysis","confLoc":"Fairborn, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00048672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061481S","chronDate":"0-0  1989","isNumber":"1812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"844","citationCount":"73","articleId":"48672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":48681,"authors":[{"name":"Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and CAD/CAM Center, Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN, USA","Electrical Engineering and CAD/CAM Center, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Lee","id":"37292819200"},{"name":"Chen","affiliation":["Sch. of Electr.

The hardware and software characteristics of current hypercubes are discussed, with emphasis on the unique aspects of their operating systems and programming languages. A sample C program is presented to illustrate the single-code, multiple-data programming style typical of distributed-memory machines in general, and hypercube applications in particular. Two contrasting hypercube applications are presented and analyzed: image processing and branch-and-bound optimization.

First, many existing algorithms need to be redesigned for efficient concurrent implementation using supercomputers. Second, a continuous increase will be apparent in the number of application-specific VLSI integrated circuits, which can provide the performance of supercomputers using single chips or chipsets (at the expense of design time for algorithm and architecture development). Both of these approaches require considerable effort in the development of algorithms for specific applications. Four independent algorithm transformation methodologies-program unfolding, retiming, look-ahead algorithms, and index mapping transformations-are reviewed.

Both standard and relaxation-based approaches are considered.

The energy dissipation per bit of communicated information, as well as the chip area dedicated to interconnections, can be significantly lower in optics than in high-speed electronics. This motivates the introduction of parallel optical interconnections through free space in communication-intensive areas of digital information processing such as switching in telecommunications and within multiprocessors.

As a tool for circuit analysis, it is allied to the superposition theorem.

First, general rules for the design of minimal-level STCs for any error-detecting code are given. The design is illustrated with STCs for 3N+B codes, 0<or=B<or=2. Then the recursive structure of both 3N+B codes and residue/inverse-residue codes with check base A=3 is revealed. The resulting design of STCs is very flexible and universal, in the sense that an iterative, cost-effective, or high-speed version of the checker can be designed for either code. The design approach, unlike previous approaches for arithmetic codes, gives a unified treatment to STCs for nonseparate (3N+B) and separate (residue and inverse residue) codes. The speed and the complexity of the STC for a code from either class with n bits are about the same. Both high-speed checkers (which have up to three gate levels) and cost-effective checkers are faster and require less hardware than analogous checkers proposed for 3N codes and for residue codes with A=3.<<ETX>>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3653014","displayDocTitle":"Design of high-speed and cost-effective self-testing checkers for low-cost arithmetic codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of high-speed and cost-effective self-testing checkers for low-cost arithmetic codes","sourcePdf":"00048866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032309S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"13","articleId":"48866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":48880,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

Thus, the performance of this multiple-symbol detection scheme fills the gap between conventional (two-symbol observation) differentially coherent detection of MPSK and ideal coherent of MPSK with differential encoding. The amount of improvement gained over conventional differential detection depends on the number of phases M and the number of additional symbol intervals added to the observation. What is particularly interesting is that substantial performance improvement can be obtained for only one or two additional symbol intervals of observation.

The authors' approach involves an iterative algorithm for the design of the quantizers (in the presence of channel errors) used for encoding the transform coefficients. This algorithm produces a set of locally optimum (in the mean-squared error sense) quantizers and the corresponding binary codeword assignment for the assumed transform coefficient statistics. To determine the optimum bit assignment among the transform coefficients, the authors have used an algorithm based on the steepest descent method, which, under certain convexity conditions on the performance of the channel-optimized quantizers, yields the optimal bit allocation. Simulation results for the performance of this locally optimum system over noisy channels have been obtained, and appropriate comparisons with a reference system designed for no channel errors have been made. It is shown that substantial performance improvements can be obtained by using this scheme. Furthermore, theoretically predicted results and rate distortion-theoretic bounds for an assumed two-dimensional image model are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal block cosine transform image coding for noisy channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.48890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1818/00048890.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.48890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1818","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=48890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/48890/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"Optimal block cosine transform image coding for noisy channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3653334","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal block cosine transform image coding for noisy channels","sourcePdf":"00048890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026979S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"1818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"42","articleId":"48890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":48891,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The method involves simultaneous imposition of temperature cycles and strain on discrete solder joints in a shear orientation. The stress, microstructure, and number of cycles to failure were monitored. Cycles to failure were determined by a continuous electrical detection method. 60Sn-40Pb and 40Sn-40In-20Pb solder joints were tested using the proposed method at 20% shear strain. The 60Sn-40Pb alloy has a shorter fatigue lifetime than 40Sn-40In-20Pb. This is attributed to heterogeneous coarsening strain in a small area of the 60Sn-40Pb microstructure. In contrast, the 40Sn-40In-20Pb microstructure becomes refined. The heterogeneous coarsening also results in cyclic softening in 60Sn-Pb, which was not observed in 40Sn-40In-20Pb. Failures initiated within the coarsened band in 60Sn-40Pb at Sn-Sn grain boundaries or phase boundaries. In contrast, failures initiated at the surface of 40Sn-40In-20Pb joints and propagated through both phases of the microstructure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3606795","volume":"12","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermomechanical fatigue of solder joints: a new comprehensive test method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermomechanical fatigue of solder joints: a new comprehensive test method","sourcePdf":"00049006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075118S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"31","articleId":"49006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49018,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

Shorts are caused by theta-phase (Al/sub 2/Cu) hillocks which nucleate and grow during high-temperature vacuum heat treatment and processing, Hillock growth occurs at high-energy sites, such as silicon precipitates and grain boundary nodal points. The growth of Al/sub 2/Cu hillocks depends on the heat-treatment/processing temperature and aluminum film purity. The growth kinetics indicates that grain boundary diffusion is the dominant mass transport mechanism. Methods used to limit theta-phase hillock formation and growth concentrate on the diffusion and nucleation mechanisms involved. Decreasing the heat-treatment/processing temperature slows the atomic diffusion required for hillock growth, and it delays, but does not prevent, theta-phase hillock formation. A 1-h heat treatment (213 Pa, N/sub 2/ ambient) at 350 degrees C produces a high density of large hillocks. Hillock density and height are generally reduced at 300 degrees C. Altering the layered structure of a metallization alters Al/sub 2/Cu hillock growth. Deposition of a hard coating as a cap on the layered structure of an aluminum-based metallization mechanically suppresses hillock formation. A layer of pure aluminum deposited beneath the aluminum-copper layer acts as a sink for copper and delays hillock formation. Increasing film copper content reduces hillock formation: theta-phase hillocks, up to 1.3 mu m in height, are observed in films with 1 wt.% copper, whereas negligible (<0.2 mu m in height) hillock formation is observed in 11 wt.% Cu films.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/33.49025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/1825/00049025.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.49025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semiconductor interlevel shorts caused by hillock formation in Al-Cu metallization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Semiconductor interlevel shorts caused by hillock formation in Al-Cu metallization","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3606814","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semiconductor interlevel shorts caused by hillock formation in Al-Cu metallization","sourcePdf":"00049025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049324S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"20","articleId":"49025","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49032,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

Each layer is assumed to have the same rectangular dimensions. Using the separation of variables, an analytical solution for the temperature at any location inside and on the boundaries of the structure is derived. Based upon the solution obtained, a computer program, Thermal, has been written in Fortran. Characteristics of the solution were studied, and several representative device structures were analyzed. The results of the simulation show how the device thermal resistance is affected by the die-bonding layer properties, the electrodes on the chip surface, and the heat spreader at the bottom surface of the chip. A FET power device was also analyzed to illustrate the very narrow hot zones produced on the chip surface, suggesting that the thermal measurement techniques must have adequate spatial resolution to measure the peak temperatures accurately. The lateral spread of heat flux into the regions of the package extending beyond the chip dimensions was studied using the boundary element method. An iteration technique based on the analytical solution has also been developed to account for the effect of this lateral heat spread. The corrected temperature using this iteration technique agrees to within 3.7% with that obtained using the boundary element method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/33.49036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/1825/00049036.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.49036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal analysis of integrated circuit devices and packages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"Thermal analysis of integrated circuit devices and packages","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3619036","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal analysis of integrated circuit devices and packages","sourcePdf":"00049036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059729S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"43","articleId":"49036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49037,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

By using the method of images, the effect of the finite lateral boundaries of a rectangular structure can be taken into account. As a result, the solution of the infinite plate structure can be utilized to represent exactly the solution of a rectangular structure. The rectangular structure solution is an infinite double Fourier cosine series. A large number of terms has to be summed for accurate temperature calculation, resulting in a prohibitively long CPU time for structures with small sources. The solution of the infinite plate structure, on the other hand, is an inverse double Fourier cosine integration. The integrand decreases very rapidly with the spatial frequencies alpha and beta . However, it is also highly oscillatory, as the location of temperature calculation is remote from the source. Consequently, general-purpose integration routines require long CPU time and produce uncertain results. By using the integration algorithm developed, it is possible to reduce the CPU time by a factor of 10 and at the same time obtain more accurate results. In comparison with the infinite Fourier series solution of the rectangular structure, the CPU time is reduced by a factor of 100 to 1000 with the use of the integral solution incorporated with the integration algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general integration algorithm for the inverse Fourier transform of four-layer infinite plate structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/33.49037","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/1825/00049037.pdf","startPage":"710","endPage":"716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.49037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1989","displayDocTitle":"A general integration algorithm for the inverse Fourier transform of four-layer infinite plate structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1989","accessionNumber":"3619037","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general integration algorithm for the inverse Fourier transform of four-layer infinite plate structures","sourcePdf":"00049037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054268S","chronDate":"Dec 1989","isNumber":"1825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"10","articleId":"49037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":49038,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.

The results also indicate that models in which these contact resistances are neglected may predict mean chip temperatures significantly below those actually present. The results also indicate that materials with thermal expansion coefficients below that of silicon tend to result in higher interface pressures and, hence, higher contact conductance than expansion matched materials.

The authors start with a split-and merge algorithm wherein the parameters have been set up so that an over-segmented image results. Region boundaries are then eliminated or modified on the basis of criteria that integrate contrast with boundary smoothness, variation of the image gradient along the boundary, and a criterion that penalizes for the presence of artifacts reflecting the data structure used during segmentation (quadtree in this case). The algorithms were implemented in the C language on a Sun 3/160 workstation running under the Unix operating system. Simple tool images and aerial photographs were used to test the algorithms. The impression of human observers is that the method is very successful on the tool images and less so on the aerial photograph images. It is thought that the success in the tool images is because the objects shown occupy areas of many pixels, making it is easy to select parameters to separate signal information from noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.49050","startPage":"225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1826/00049050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.49050","endPage":"233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating region growing and edge detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Integrating region growing and edge detection","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3641637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating region growing and edge detection","sourcePdf":"00049050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041814S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"368","articleId":"49050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49051,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1826/00049051.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.49051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.49051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scale-space for discrete signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal resolution","Kernel","Smoothing methods","Convolution","Image resolution","Laplace equations","Filtering","Signal processing","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete systems","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","nonnegative kernels","unimodal kernels","spatial domain","discrete signals","discrete scale-space theory","diffusion equation","Gaussian kernel","discrete smoothing transformations","frequency domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"Scale-space for discrete signals","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3641638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scale-space for discrete signals","sourcePdf":"00049051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046037S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"390","articleId":"49051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49052,"authors":[{"name":"W.E.L.

A common method for finding an object's pose is the generalized Hough transform, which accumulates evidence for possible coordinate transformations in a parameter space whose axes are the quantized transformation parameters. Large clusters of similar transformations in that space are taken as evidence of a correct match. A theoretical analysis of the behavior of such methods is presented. The authors derive bounds on the set of transformations consistent with each pairing of data and model features, in the presence of noise and occlusion in the image. Bounds are provided on the likelihood of false peaks in the parameter space, as a function of noise, occlusion, and tessellation effects. It is argued that haphazardly applying such methods to complex recognition tasks is risky, as the probability of false positives can be very high.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1826/00049052.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.49052","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.49052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the sensitivity of the Hough transform for object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Clustering methods","Artificial intelligence","Laboratories","Contracts","Layout","Robot kinematics","Robot vision systems","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","picture processing","sensitivity","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","picture processing","false peak likelihood bound","sensitivity","Hough transform","object recognition","sensory data","coordinate transformations","noise","occlusion","tessellation effects","false positives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1990","displayDocTitle":"On the sensitivity of the Hough transform for object recognition","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","accessionNumber":"3641639","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the sensitivity of the Hough transform for object recognition","sourcePdf":"00049052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041502S","chronDate":"Mar 1990","isNumber":"1826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"155","articleId":"49052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49081,"authors":[{"name":"C.B.

The method consists of two steps. First, given the probabilistic electric load model, the probability distribution function of the total generation of generation buses is computed. Second, circuit flows and bus voltage magnitudes are expressed as linear combinations of power injections at generation buses. This relationship allows the computation of the distribution functions of circuit flows and bus voltage magnitudes. The method incorporates major operating practices such as economic dispatch and nonlinearities resulting from the power flow equations. Validation of the method is performed via Monte Carlo simulation. Typical results are presented, showing that the proposed method matches the results obtained with the Monte Carlo simulations very well. Potential applications of the proposed method are: composite power system reliability analysis and transmission loss evaluation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/1828/00049104.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.49104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.49104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new probabilistic power flow analysis method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow analysis","Voltage","Power system simulation","Power system modeling","Probability distribution","Distributed computing","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Power system analysis computing","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","Monte Carlo methods","power systems","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic power flow analysis method","simulation","composite power system","probability distribution function","circuit flows","bus voltage magnitudes","electric load model","power injections","generation buses","Monte Carlo simulation","reliability analysis","transmission loss evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","displayDocTitle":"A new probabilistic power flow analysis method","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","accessionNumber":"3631970","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new probabilistic power flow analysis method","sourcePdf":"00049104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106328S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"107","articleId":"49104","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49107,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.F.M.

The application considers the system operational conditions according to the 1986 Operational Plan coordinated by ELETROBRAS, the Brazilian electric holding company. The algorithm is based on a network flow approach especially developed for hydrothermal scheduling. For the south-southeast interconnected system, the problem formulation suggests a primal decomposition optimization approach. Two applications have been performed: in a study context, the system has been evaluated for the most critical stream flow ever recorded; in an operational context, the system has been simulated through an adaptive operational planning approach. The results show that the algorithm can be a useful tool for large-scale hydrothermal systems, giving insight into operational characteristics and/or adding to the guidance of real system operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3631973","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A large scale of an optimal deterministic hydrothermal scheduling algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A large scale of an optimal deterministic hydrothermal scheduling algorithm","sourcePdf":"00049107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027328S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"27","articleId":"49107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":49111,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This approach provides a rational modeling of the problem by considering the outages of thermal units and the uncertainty of the demand. Thermal unit commitment is optimized by using dynamic programming. The calculation of the expected cost of thermal generation and the evaluation of commitment risk are performed by the segmentation method. For hydrothermal coordination, an expected incremental cost grid of thermal generation is constructed for different levels of hydro generating capacity by introducing a new algorithm which supplements the segmentation method with an efficient shifting technique. The gradient method is then applied to use this grid in the optimal dispatch of hydro units. The global optimization is executed in an iterative loop which consists of the thermal unit commitment and hydrothermal coordination.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1990","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3631983","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hydrothermal unit commitment with probabilistic constraints using segmentation method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydrothermal unit commitment with probabilistic constraints using segmentation method","sourcePdf":"00049117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04371S","chronDate":"Feb.  1990","isNumber":"1828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"28","articleId":"49117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":49122,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A 3D blood flow model is formulated, allowing the test of various correlation algorithms to detect motion completely. Time correlation techniques giving axial displacement can be extended to transverse directions to detect 3D motion. The principle of a multiple probe is defined, and the implementation of the associated processing is demonstrated. It relies mainly on the time domain correlation processor used for axial detection, working also for transverse components. The complexity of this process is about five times that of the axial correlation processor.

This switch architecture can further improve the hardware-utilization efficiency of the memory switch by increasing the buffer memory usage rate. A discussion on switch traffic characteristics is provided and indicates that buffer sharing reduced the required memory size to less than 0.14 of that otherwise required for adequate switch size and estimates roughly the buffer size required for the switch. The large scale integration (LSI) count, for example, is about 15 chips for the main part of a 32*32 switch (150 Mb/s for each port) which can be mounted on one printed board. The switch is partitioned into a buffer memory LSI and a control LSI to make them flexible to change in ATM switch specifications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49679","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049679.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"122 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A shared buffer memory switch for an ATM exchange","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49679/","displayDocTitle":"A shared buffer memory switch for an ATM exchange","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3544470","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A shared buffer memory switch for an ATM exchange","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074883S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"129","articleId":"49679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":49689,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.

The simplicity of the predistorter is worth noting; only two parameters ( alpha /sub 1/ and alpha /sub 3/) need to be estimated in place of tens of the third-order kernel coefficients, as proposed in previous schemes. The performance gain is about 3 dB for a 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) system without predistortion and 1 dB for a system with memoryless data predistortion.

In particular, the temporal and statistical behavior of pseudonoise bursts generated by spectral phase coding of ultrashort optical pulses is discussed. The analysis is motivated by recent experiments, which demonstrate high-resolution spectral phase coding of picosecond and femtosecond pulses and suggested the possibility of ultrahigh-speed code-division multiple access (CDMA) communications using this technique. The evolution of coherent ultrashort pulses is traced into low-intensity pseudonoise bursts as a function of the degree of phase coding. For random coding it is found that the encoded pulse obeys Gaussian statistics and that the intensity probability distribution function is a negative exponential. These results are utilized to calculate the performance (bit error rate) of a proposed ultrashort-pulse CDMA communications system as a function of data rate, code length, number of users, and receiver threshold. It is found that performance improves drastically with increasing code length.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal and statistical analysis of ultrashort light pulse code-division multiple access communications network","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49788","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049788.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"733 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49788","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Temporal and statistical analysis of ultrashort light pulse code-division multiple access communications network","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3544513","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal and statistical analysis of ultrashort light pulse code-division multiple access communications network","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058236S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"3","articleId":"49788","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":49798,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

To avoid error propagation caused by differential encoding/decoding, and also to combat bursty channel noise, a data interleave/deinterleave scheme is integrated into the forward error-code (FEC) codec. Specific signal waveshaping is achieved digitally after FEC encoding to produce signals free of intersymbol interference (ISI) and timing jitter while providing a compact power spectrum. Experimentally measured results including signal waveforms, eye diagrams, power spectrum, and bit error rate (BER) performance in linear and hardlimited transmission channels are reported. The BER results show that the power efficiency of the modem is excellent. Spectral regrowth of the modulated signal is also retained at the minimum to ensure minimum interference to adjacent channels and thus maximize the channel utilization efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49798","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","startPage":"787","endPage":"791 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of convolutional coded SQAM in hardlimited satellite channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of convolutional coded SQAM in hardlimited satellite channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49798/","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3544522","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of convolutional coded SQAM in hardlimited satellite channels","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03018S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"1","articleId":"49798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":49803,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The results show that the use of block FEC coding provides a significant improvement in the normalized net channel throughput, approach values which are competitive with those for nonspread-spectrum ALOHA-type random access channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of asynchronous random access CDMA with block FEC coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49885","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049885.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1272 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of asynchronous random access CDMA with block FEC coding","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3544563","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of asynchronous random access CDMA with block FEC coding","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052048S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"4","articleId":"49885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":49899,"authors":[{"name":"N.-J.

The use of 2-D symbol sets leads to the problem that an additional 2-D symbol synchronization is necessary. However, this can easily be achieved because each 2-D symbol comprises either two even or two odd 8PSK symbols, i.e. given the first 8PSK symbol of a 2-D symbol, the second one is chosen out of a 4PSK set, which can even be used to obtain better phase synchronization. Another advantage of applying 2-D codes is that Viterbi decoding has to be performed with only half the symbol rate, which can be desirable for high-speed applications. With the help of a novel arithmetic architecture, it is possible to design a 100-Mb/s Viterbi decoder. Two basic methods of deriving new codes are used: the application of multidimensional code symbols and the method of symbol-by-butterfly replacement.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49908","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049908.pdf","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1392 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New rotationally invariant trellis codes for 8PSK modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49908/","displayDocTitle":"New rotationally invariant trellis codes for 8PSK modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3567648","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New rotationally invariant trellis codes for 8PSK modulation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031034S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"9","articleId":"49908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":49923,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Partial response methods are also investigated, but they are not favored for implementation since they require a Viterbi detector to achieve better performance than the DFE at the higher densities and their performance is very sensitive to the exact choice of the partial response polynomial.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049950.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1622 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel equalization methods for magnetic storage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic memory","Adaptive equalizers","Decision feedback equalizers","Costs","Algorithm design and analysis","Adaptive systems","Sampling methods","Viterbi algorithm","Detectors","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","equalisers","magnetic disc storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-length-limited codes","partial response methods","channel equalisation methods","magnetic discs","magnetic storage","adaptive equalization","peak detection","sampling detection methods","adaptive decision feedback equalization","DFE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Channel equalization methods for magnetic storage","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3567690","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel equalization methods for magnetic storage","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037298S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"25","articleId":"49950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":49954,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Not only does RAM-DFE outperform the conventional DFE under many circumstances, but it is also more conducive to a high-speed digital implementation, making the RAM-DFE appropriate for the higher data rates (linear densities) that its improved performance facilitates. Preliminary investigations indicate that the RAM-DFE can be implemented in 1.6- mu m CMOS on a single VLSI chip (about 50000 transistors) with a sampling (data) rate of 54 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive DFE for storage channels suffering from nonlinear ISI (magnetic recording)","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1989.49954","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, World Prosperity Through Communications,","pdfPath":"/iel5/799/1834/00049954.pdf","startPage":"1638","endPage":"1642 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1989.49954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1834","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=49954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/49954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive DFE for storage channels suffering from nonlinear ISI (magnetic recording)","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3567694","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive DFE for storage channels suffering from nonlinear ISI (magnetic recording)","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00049954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103589S","chronDate":"11-14 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1834","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"799","citationCount":"23","articleId":"49954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":49956,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The sensitivity of QAM and SQAM systems to timing jitter and phase jitter is analyzed. It is shown that the superiority of SQAM over WAM depends strongly on the filter roll-off factor. SQAM provides better performance compared to QAM only the roll-off factor is larger than about 0.5.

On the receiver side, it is shown that it is possible to use two lines of BPSK (binary PSK) differential detection. Doing so makes possible a decision on the polarity of the received data by simultaneous sampling of the inphase and quadrature channels.
