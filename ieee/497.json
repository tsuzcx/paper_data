The unconventional beamforming technique used allows us to obtain 2-D RF images with axial and lateral modulations. Based on these images, we propose a method that uses phase images instead of amplitude images. This way of proceeding allows us to provide an analytical solution to the local displacement estimation so that no minimization of a classical cost function is used for the local estimation. For this reason, the local estimator is directly applied to signals, without the need to process a complex cross-correlation function, as is done with most of the phase shift estimators. In this paper, the method is applied to elastography. Results with simulated data show that a downsampling of axial and lateral modulated signals leads to very little change in the accuracy and in the spatial resolution of the proposed method. For example, for decimation factors of 2 in the axial direction and of 4 in the lateral direction, the mean axial absolute error is 3 mum. The same estimation with original images provides a mean axial error of 0.7 mum. The accuracy of the lateral motion is unchanged in this case. The accuracy of our method with downsampled signals is an important issue in the purpose of a real-time implementation. With experimental data, for the same level of estimation error, classical block matching using the maximum of cross correlation as a local estimator requires images that are 36 times larger (in number of pixels) and consequently a computational time roughly 10 times longer. Our phase block matching is also shown to provide 10 percent less error than a motion estimation method based on seeking the zero of the complex correlation function phase. Finally, it is shown that given the separability of the local estimator that we propose, our method can be applied on both n-D signals and classical RF ultrasound images. The phase block matching method presented was implemented in real time on an ultrasound research scanner.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-based block matching applied to motion estimation with unconventional beamforming strategies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1127","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4976266/04976280.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Phase-based block matching applied to motion estimation with unconventional beamforming strategies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4976280/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666203","pubMedId":"19473913","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-based block matching applied to motion estimation with unconventional beamforming strategies","sourcePdf":"t0950945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099975S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4976266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4976266","articleId":"4976280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4976281,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It was proposed but not thoroughly investigated that the media layer (ML) thickness (MLT), its composition, and its texture may be indicative of cardiovascular risk and for differentiating between patients with high and low risk. In this study, we investigate an automated method for segmenting the ML and the intima layer (IL) and measurement of the MLT and the intima layer thickness (ILT) in ultrasound images of the CCA. The snakes segmentation method was used and was evaluated on 100 longitudinal ultrasound images acquired from asymptomatic subjects, against manual segmentation performed by a neurovascular expert. The mean plusmn standard deviation (sd) for the first and second sets of manual and the automated IMT, MLT, and ILT measurements were 0.71 plusmn 0.17 mm, 0.72 plusmn 0.17 mm, 0.67 plusmn 0.12 mm; 0.25 plusmn 0.12 mm, 0.27 plusmn 0.14 mm, 0.25 plusmn 0.11 mm; and 0.43 plusmn 0.10 mm, 0.44 plusmn 0.13 mm, and 0.42 plusmn 0.10 mm, respectively. There was overall no significant difference between the manual and the automated IMC, ML, and IL segmentation measurements. Therefore, the automated segmentation method proposed in this study may be used successfully in the measurement of the MLT and ILT complementing the manual measurements. MLT was also shown to increase with age (for both the manual and the automated measurements). Future research will incorporate the extraction of texture features from the segmented ML and IL bands, which may indicate the risk of future cardiovascular events. However, more work is needed for validating the proposed technique in a larger sample of subjects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manual and automated media and intima thickness measurements of the common carotid artery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1130","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4976266/04976283.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Manual and automated media and intima thickness measurements of the common carotid artery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4976283/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666205","pubMedId":"19473916","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manual and automated media and intima thickness measurements of the common carotid artery","sourcePdf":"t0950983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096852S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4976266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4976266","articleId":"4976283","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4976284,"authors":[{"name":"T.-Y.

The fractionated tissue volume can be monitored with ultrasound imaging because a significant ultrasound backscatter reduction occurs. This paper correlates the ultrasound backscatter reduction with the degree of tissue fractionation characterized by the percentage of remaining normal-appearing cell nuclei on histology. Different degrees of tissue fractionation were generated in vitro in freshly excised porcine kidneys by varying the number of therapeutic ultrasound pulses from 100 to 2000 pulses per treatment location. All ultrasound pulses were 15 cycles at 1 MHz delivered at 100 Hz pulse repetition frequency and 19 MPa peak negative pressure. The results showed that the normalized backscatter intensity decreased exponentially with increasing number of pulses. Correspondingly, the percentage of normal appearing nuclei in the treated area decreased exponentially as well. A linear correlation existed between the normalized backscatter intensity and the percentage of normal appearing cell nuclei in the treated region. This suggests that the normalized backscatter intensity may be a potential quantitative real-time feedback parameter for histotripsy-induced tissue fractionation. This quantitative feedback may allow the prediction of local clinical outcomes, i.e., when a tissue volume has been sufficiently treated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4976266/04976284.pdf","startPage":"995","endPage":"1005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative ultrasound backscatter for pulsed cavitational ultrasound therapy-histotripsy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Backscatter","Fractionation","Ultrasonic transducers","Biomedical engineering","Acoustic pulses","Cells (biology)","Acoustic transducers","Focusing","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","biological tissues","biomedical ultrasonics","correlation methods","kidney","surgery","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic therapy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cavitational ultrasound therapy","histotripsy","ultrasonic tissue ablation technology","tissue structure fractionation","ultrasound imaging","ultrasound backscatter","kidney","cell nuclei","linear correlation","frequency 1 MHz","frequency 100 Hz"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Kidney","Kidney Diseases","Swine","Ultrasonic Therapy","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative ultrasound backscatter for pulsed cavitational ultrasound therapy-histotripsy","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4976284/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10697947","pubMedId":"19750596","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative ultrasound backscatter for pulsed cavitational ultrasound therapy-histotripsy","sourcePdf":"t0950995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178709S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4976266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4976266","articleId":"4976284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4976294,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The membrane and cell cavities are deposited and patterned on separate wafers and fusion-bonded in a vacuum environment to create CMUT cells. A user-grown silicon-nitride membrane layer avoids the need for expensive silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers, reduces parasitic capacitance, and reduces dielectric charging. It allows more freedom in selecting the membrane thickness while also providing the benefits of wafer-bonding fabrication such as excellent fill factor, ease of vacuum sealing, and a simplified fabrication process when compared with the more standard sacrificial release process. The devices fabricated have a cell diameter of 22 mum, a membrane thickness of 400 nm, a gap depth of 150 nm, and an insulation thickness of 250 nm. The resonant frequency of the CMUT in air is 17 MHz and has an attenuation compensated center frequency of ~9 MHz in immersion with a -6 dB fractional bandwidth of 123%. This paper presents the fabrication process and some characterization results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4976266/04976294.pdf","startPage":"1074","endPage":"1084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabricating capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers with a novel silicon-nitride-Based wafer bonding process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic transducers","Wafer bonding","Biomembranes","Fabrication","Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Silicon on insulator technology","Insulation testing","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Parasitic capacitance","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive sensors","micromachining","silicon compounds","silicon-on-insulator","ultrasonic transducers","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers","silicon nitride","wafer bonding process","membrane cavity","cell cavity","silicon-on-insulator wafers","SOI wafers","dielectric charging","insulation thickness","SiN"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electric Capacitance","Microscopy, Atomic Force","Microtechnology","Silicon Compounds","Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared","Transducers","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fabricating capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers with a novel silicon-nitride-Based wafer bonding process","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4976294/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10666192","pubMedId":"19473926","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabricating capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers with a novel silicon-nitride-Based wafer bonding process","sourcePdf":"t0951074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124982S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4976266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4976266","articleId":"4976294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4976339,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Henaut","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Henaut","id":"37396290700"},{"name":"Daniela Dragomirescu","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Dragomirescu","id":"37266574500"},{"name":"Robert Plana","affiliation":["LAAS-CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Plana","id":"37278833200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3469-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3551-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4976339","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor systems","Satellite broadcasting","Prototypes","Aerospace industry","System testing","Aircraft manufacture","Manufacturing","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aircraft communication","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","field programmable gate array prototyping","radio interface design","aerospace wireless sensor network","single carrier-frequency division multiple access","peak average power ratio","OFDM scheme","electronic system level","Synplify DSP","propagation channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radio interface","SC-FDMA","MB-OFDM","WSN","FPGA prototyping","ESL"]}],"abstract":"This paper gives an overview of development and prototyping of a radio interface designed for high data rate wireless sensor networks (WSN) using a top down approach.

Yet in production quality modeling, the knowledge of how output characteristics varies with input attributes gives a great help to forecasting, monitoring and controlling in the production process. In this paper, a production quality modeling method based on regression rules extracted from artificial neural networks is proposed. Each rule corresponds to a subregion of the input space and a linear function that approximates the network output for all the samples in this subregion. Experiments on real industrial data demonstrate that the proposed approach not only can successfully extract simple and useful rules indicating important system information, but also have better performances than existing rule extraction methods and traditional statistical methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICONS.2009.26","startPage":"197","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976299/4976300/04976343.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICONS.2009.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Production Quality Modeling Based on Regression Rules Extracted from Trained Artificial Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Piecewise linear approximation","Data mining","Production systems","Predictive models","Monitoring","Linear regression","Piecewise linear techniques","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","production engineering computing","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["production quality modeling","regression rules","artificial neural networks","statistical methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["system modeling","production quality modeling","regression rule","rule extraction","artificial neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Production Quality Modeling Based on Regression Rules Extracted from Trained Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4976343/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"1-6 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10665840","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Production Quality Modeling Based on Regression Rules Extracted from Trained Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Gosier, France","sourcePdf":"3551a197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064564S","chronDate":"1-6 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976299","isNumber":"4976300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976299","xplore-issue":"4976300","articleId":"4976343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4976444,"authors":[{"name":"Serap A.

The main contribution of this paper is to show that the proposed system presents a performance very close to the theoretical limits, even at low SNR, as long as the curve parameters are properly optimized.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976434/4976435/04976454.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2009.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2009.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Joint Source Channel Coding Using Space-Filling Curves and MMSE Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel coding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN channels","Channel capacity","Rate distortion theory","Performance analysis","Laplace equations","Additive white noise","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","decoding","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog joint source channel coding","MMSE decoding","Gaussian sources","Laplacian sources","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog coding","space-filling curves","MMSE decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analog Joint Source Channel Coding Using Space-Filling Curves and MMSE Decoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4976454/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10666322","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Joint Source Channel Coding Using Space-Filling Curves and MMSE Decoding","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"3592a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054986S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976434","isNumber":"4976435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976434","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4976435","articleId":"4976454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4976455,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37272892600"},{"name":"Jingjing Fu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Fu","id":"37403056900"},{"name":"Zhouchen Lin","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhouchen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291170100"},{"name":"Bing Zeng","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37270871000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3592-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3753-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0359"}],"articleNumber":"4976455","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Rate-distortion","Distortion measurement","Bipartite graph","Decoding","Differential equations","Entropy coding","Sparse matrices","Data compression","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","differential equations","encoding","graph theory","rate distortion theory","sampling methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-distortion performance","compressive sensing","binary sparse source","bipartite graph","decoding process","differential equations","random sampling","code measurements","rate-distortion curves"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes to use a bipartite graph to represent compressive sensing (CS).

Given the nonstationarity of many natural signals such as images, the sparse space is varying in time or spatial domain. As such, CS recovery should be conducted in locally adaptive, signal-dependent spaces to counter the fact that the CS measurements are global and irrespective of signal structures. On the contrary existing CS reconstruction methods use a fixed set of bases (e.g., wavelets, DCT, and gradient spaces) for the entirety of a signal. To rectify this problem we propose a new model-based framework to facilitate the use of adaptive bases in CS recovery. In a case study we integrate a piecewise stationary autoregressive model into the recovery process for CS-coded images, and are able to increase the reconstruction quality by 2 ~ 7dB over existing methods. The new CS recovery framework can readily incorporate prior knowledge to boost reconstruction quality.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2009.69","publicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976434/4976435/04976456.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2009.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976435","startPage":"123","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Guided Adaptive Recovery of Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Guided Adaptive Recovery of Compressive Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976456/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10666324","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4976456/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Guided Adaptive Recovery of Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"3592a123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142052S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976434","isNumber":"4976435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976434","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4976435","articleId":"4976456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4976465,"authors":[{"name":"Demijan Klinc","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Demijan","lastName":"Klinc","id":"37392241700"},{"name":"Carmit Hazay","affiliation":["Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Carmit","lastName":"Hazay","id":"38488952100"},{"name":"Ashish Jagmohan","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

However, it was not known how to compress data encrypted with non-stream ciphers. In this paper, we address the problem of compressing data encrypted with block ciphers, such as the advanced encryption standard (AES) used in conjunction with one of the commonly employed chaining modes. We show that such data can be feasibly compressed without knowledge of the key. We present performance results for practical code constructions used to compress binary sources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976434/4976435/04976465.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2009.71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2009.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Compression of Data Encrypted with Block Ciphers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Data compression","IP networks","Hardware","Costs","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data encryption","data compression","block cipher"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Compression of Data Encrypted with Block Ciphers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4976465/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10666331","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Compression of Data Encrypted with Block Ciphers","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"3592a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045799S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976434","isNumber":"4976435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976434","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4976435","articleId":"4976465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4976469,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Rein","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy and Automation Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Berlin"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Rein","id":"37268505800"},{"name":"Stephan Lehmann","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy and Automation Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin, Berlin"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Lehmann","id":"38361473600"},{"name":"Clemens G\u00fchmann","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy and Automation Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"G\u00fchmann","id":"37646440900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3592-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3753-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0359"}],"articleNumber":"4976469","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Image sensors","Read-write memory","Partitioning algorithms","Memory management","Random access memory","Flash memory","Image coding","Data compression","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","flash memories","image coding","performance evaluation","random-access storage","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet image two-line coder","wireless sensor node","RAM","memory constraints","flash memory card","monochrome picture","data compression rates","set partitioning","hierarchical trees algorithm","wavelet subband","backward encode","wavelet trees","compression performance evaluation","PC-code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976469","abstract":"This paper gives a novel wavelet image two-line (Wi2l) coder that is designed to fulfill the memory constraints of a typical wireless sensor node.

The coder works recursively on two lines of a wavelet subband while intermediate data of these lines is stored to backward encode the wavelet trees.

Simulation results show that using the proposed methods, one can achieve up to 5 dB improvement over conventional intra coding for relatively low motion sequences and up to 1.3 dB improvement for relatively high motion sequences.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4976482/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10666348","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Spatio-Temporal Key Frame Encoding for Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Spatio-Temporal Key Frame Encoding for Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"3592a382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048147S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976434","isNumber":"4976435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976434","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4976435","articleId":"4976482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4976485,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Barret","affiliation":["IMS Team, SUPELEC, Metz, France"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Barret","id":"37560960500"},{"name":"Jean-Louis Gutzwiller","affiliation":["IMS Team, SUPELEC, Metz, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Louis","lastName":"Gutzwiller","id":"37428081200"},{"name":"Isidore Paul Akam Bita","affiliation":["LUXSpace Sarl, Betzdorf, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Isidore Paul Akam","lastName":"Bita","id":"37063508300"},{"name":"Florio Dalla Vedova","affiliation":["LUXSpace Sarl, Betzdorf, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Florio Dalla","lastName":"Vedova","id":"38075872600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3592-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3753-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-0314"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0359"}],"articleNumber":"4976485","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Image coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Hyperspectral sensors","Discrete wavelet transforms","Vectors","Image sensors","Codecs","Principal component analysis","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lossy hyperspectral image coding","exogenous quasioptimal transform","transform coding","Karhunen-Loeve transform","optimal spectral transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral Image Compression","Transform Coding"]}],"abstract":"It is well known in transform coding that the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) can be suboptimal for non Gaussian sources. However in many applications using JPEG2000 Part 2 codecs, the KLT is generally considered as the optimal linear transform for reducing redundancies between components of hyperspectral images. In previous works, optimal spectral transforms (OST) compatible with the JPEG2000 Part 2 standard have been introduced, performing better than the KLT but with an heavier computational cost. In this paper, we show that the OST computed on a learning basis constituted of hyperion hyperspectral images issued from one sensor performs very well, and even better than the KLT, on other images issued from the same sensor.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2009.8","publicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression

when only partial coefficients are available. We have been inspired by the recently developed compressive sensing (CS) decoding, which is capable in recovering sparse signals from a few linear and non-adaptive measurements. Let x be a sparse signal with N entries and only K out of them are non-zero, and y be its approximation coefficients. Classic CS decoding such as l1-minimization can be applied to decode x from y, and it indeed provides better reconstruction of sparse signals than direct inverse transform, as demonstrated by our simulation results. When coefficients have been quantized, the performance of CS decoding decreases more severely compared with direct inverse transform, but still better than the latter once the signal is sparse enough.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2009.19","publicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976434/4976435/04976509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976435","startPage":"455","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Inverse Wavelet Transform by Compressive Sensing Decoding with Deconvolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Inverse Wavelet Transform by Compressive Sensing Decoding with Deconvolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10666369","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4976509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Inverse Wavelet Transform by Compressive Sensing Decoding with Deconvolution","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"3592a455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054703S","chronDate":"16-18 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976434","isNumber":"4976435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4976435","articleId":"4976509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4976602,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew German","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"German","id":"37430198400"},{"name":"Michael Jenkin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Jenkin","id":"37269066400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3684-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3584-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-1864"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-1872"}],"articleNumber":"4976602","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976602","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicles","Leg","Legged locomotion","Drag","Marine vehicles","Remotely operated vehicles","Simulated annealing","Control system synthesis","Robot sensing systems","Propulsion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legged locomotion","simulated annealing","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait synthesis","underwater vehicle","legged autonomous vehicle","simulated annealing engine","black box hydrodynamic vehicle model","AQUA amphibious hexapod"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["legged robot","gait synthesis"]}],"abstract":"Legged autonomous vehicles move by executing patterns of leg-joint angles known as gaits. Synthesizing gaits by hand is a complex and time-consuming task which becomes even more challenging when the vehicle operates underwater. When operating underwater any motion of the limbs applies forces to the vehicle. Underwater gaits must therefore be constructed to mitigate these unwanted forces while meeting the desired gait properties. This paper presents an automatic gait synthesis system for underwater legged vehicles. The system utilizes a simulated annealing engine coupled with a black box hydrodynamic vehicle model to synthesize the desired gait.

Also, for longitudinal motion controller design for the UAV to follow a pre-defined trajectory, the pole-placement technique is used. It is assumed that the runway relative position and orientation are provided by a built in vision system and its associated image processing unit. The performance of the controller in the presence of the Gaussian noises is investigated by the 6DOF computer simulation for a known fixed-wing UAV.

Currently, Optical Circuit Switching has been widely deployed, although this approach is potentially bandwidth-inefficient for small granularity flows and needs relatively long set-up times. Research is being done into Optical Packet Switching (OPS) and Optical Burst Switching (OBS), but these kinds of architectures are not yet able to be deployed due to the large network cost they impose. This paper tries to combine the benefits from OCS and OBS, by investigating a hybrid switching technique called burst-over-circuit switching (BoCS) where both OBS and OCS are used at a specific part in the network. First, a short summary will be provided, categorising existing hybrid ideas. Then, a simulation study will evaluate how well BoCS performs compared to pure OBS or OCS and finally the feasibility of the proposed method will be investigated by a network cost analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976719","publicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Networking and Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fifth International Conference on Networking and Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4976718/4976719/04976809.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICNS.2009.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNS.2009.12","startPage":"499","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Effective Burst-Over-Circuit-Switching in a Hybrid Optical Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976809/","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective Burst-Over-Circuit-Switching in a Hybrid Optical Network","htmlLink":"/document/4976809/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 April 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10684836","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective Burst-Over-Circuit-Switching in a Hybrid Optical Network","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"3586a499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07268S","chronDate":"20-25 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4976718","isNumber":"4976719","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4976718","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4976719","articleId":"4976809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4976933,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The methods introduced require only simple matched filtering operations at the receiver and permit usage of arbitrary waveforms with potential for waveform diversity gains.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04976948.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4976948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4976948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cancellation of range ambiguities with block coding techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Reflection","Matched filters","Filtering","Clutter","Doppler radar","Azimuth","Delay","Radar imaging","Radar remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","echo suppression","matched filters","radar interference","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block coding techniques","range ambiguities cancellation","radar signaling schemes","echo cancellation","signal reflections","matched filtering","receiver","waveform diversity gains"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cancellation of range ambiguities with block coding techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4976948/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10686111","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cancellation of range ambiguities with block coding techniques","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075119S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4976948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4976950,"authors":[{"name":"William Roberts","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Roberts","id":"37589302000"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843500"},{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Stoica","id":"37277401700"},{"name":"Tarik Yardibi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Yardibi","id":"37391956900"},{"name":"Firooz A.

Furthermore, with a MIMO antenna array, the linear independence of reflected signals from scattering points allows for the direct application of adaptive array processing techniques. High levels of noise and strong clutter presence, however, significantly worsen detection performance. The iterative adaptive approach (IAA), a non-parametric and user parameter-free weighted least-squares algorithm, was recently shown to offer improved resolution and interference rejection for array processing applications. In this paper, we extend IAA to perform angle-range-Doppler imaging using a MIMO radar system.

Exploiting spatial diversity, the key advantage of a distributed aperture radar, requires orthogonality in, for example, the frequency, time, waveform, dimensions across sensors. This paper focuses on the simplest of these cases; frequency orthogonality. Here we address the key drawback associated with frequency diversity: whereas the use of multiple frequency bands requires additional RF hardware, an OFDM-based system needs only a single oscillator and demodulator while yet maintaining frequency orthogonality. OFDM employs many sub-carriers within a single frequency band instead of occupying different frequency bands. Separation of the signals can be performed oversampling of the incoming signal followed by a Fast Fourier transform (FFT).","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4976970","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04976970.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4976970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed aperture OFDM radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976970/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed aperture OFDM radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10686131","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4976970/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed aperture OFDM radar","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070867S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4976970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4976974,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick K.

Nevertheless, the principle has been analyzed and used in a few examples since the early 80s or even before. A MIMO-radar is characterised by a number N of transmitting and a number M of receiving antennas forming N times M Tx/Rx pairs where each propagation path from the nth transmit antenna to the object to the mth receive antenna is made available to the signal processing. This can be achieved by temporal multiplexing, spatial coding and/or orthogonal waveforms. A further step is to transfer this technique to the SAR case. Additionally, the whole array is moving, SAR processing can be applied. Possible geometries of MIMO-SAR are along track arrays (reduction of azimuth-ambiguities, moving target indication, super resolution) or across track arrays (reduction of elevation-ambiguities, interferometry, 3D down-looking SAR). In this paper, some aspects of moving MIMO-arrays for SAR will be addressed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System architectures and algorithms for radar imaging by MIMO-SAR","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4976997","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04976997.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4976997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4976997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4976997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"System architectures and algorithms for radar imaging by MIMO-SAR","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4976997/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10685941","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System architectures and algorithms for radar imaging by MIMO-SAR","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100499S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4976997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977001,"authors":[{"name":"SangHyun Chang","affiliation":["Engineering & Applied Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"SangHyun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37539733600"},{"name":"Rangoli Sharan","affiliation":["Engineering & Applied Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rangoli","lastName":"Sharan","id":"38068024600"},{"name":"Michael Wolf","affiliation":["Engineering & Applied Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37398766100"},{"name":"Naoki Mitsumoto","affiliation":["Research laboratories, DENSO Corporation, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Mitsumoto","id":"38063114100"},{"name":"Joel W.

The approach is based on a specular multi-path model for UWB radar scatters from walking humans. Empirical studies show that multipath time-of-arrival (TOA) can be modeled as a point process whose behavior is governed by a Gamma distribution. Based on this insight, we develop a tracking procedure that combines a Kalman Filter with a point process observation model whose measurements are processed with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure. As a byproduct, the EM procedure solves the multi-target data segmentation and data association problems. We present experimental results in which a monostatic UWB radar tracks both individual and up to two human targets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977001/","accessionNumber":"10685945","displayDocTitle":"UWB radar-based human target tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB radar-based human target tracking","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060871S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4977002,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Current modulation techniques such as derivative phase shift keying (DPSK) and minimum shift keying (MSK), which are applicable to binary-coded waveforms, are well-known implementation schemes for spectral containment. The CPM implementation is applicable to polyphase codes and can also achieve better spectral containment, though a by-product is increased range sidelobes that result due to the deviation from the idealized code (implicitly defined for squared-shaped chips). To ameliorate the increased range sidelobes, a version of least-squares mismatched filtering is employed that accommodates the continuous nature of the CPM structure. Also, continuous rise/fall-time transitions of the pulse are addressed as part of the holistic implementation of the CPM-based waveform. It is observed that for the CPM implementation the rise/fall-time becomes the limiting factor on spectral containment and a rather simple scheme based on Chireaux out-phasing is suggested as a means to ldquoslow downrdquo the pulse rise/fall.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar

The Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) based Adaptive Pulse Compression (APC) algorithm is capable of suppressing range sidelobes into the noise by employing a unique pulse compression filter for each range cell. Recently, Fast APC (FAPC) has been developed to reduce the computational cost of APC while maintaining much of the sidelobe suppression capability. This paper utilizes the MVDR framework to facilitate inclusion of a unity gain constraint within the APC and FAPC cost functions in an effort to mitigate mismatch loss. The APC algorithm exhibits almost no mismatch loss and, as such, the full-dimension algorithm benefits little from the gain constraint. However, FAPC occasionally suppresses small targets in dense scattering environments due to fewer degrees of freedom inherent to reduced-dimensionality processing. The constrained FAPC algorithm preserves gain on small targets consequently improving detection performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10685955","htmlLink":"/document/4977011/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Gain-constrained adaptive pulse compression via an MVDR framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain-constrained adaptive pulse compression via an MVDR framework","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038672S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4977015,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Schuerger","affiliation":["Department of Physics/Department of ECE, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Schuerger","id":"37661986200"},{"name":"Dmitriy Garmatyuk","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Garmatyuk","id":"37391571200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2870-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2871-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4977015","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":909},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Jamming","Radar imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Digital communication","Projection algorithms","Matched filters","Probability density function","Autocorrelation","Radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random OFDM radar signals","deception jamming scenarios","OFDM waveforms","synthetic aperture radar imaging","digital radio frequency memory","repeat jammer","radar transmitted waveform","back projection algorithm","matched filter","Monte Carlo simulations","probability density functions"]}],"abstract":"The paper examines the performance of randomly generated OFDM waveforms in presence of deception jamming. The scenario of interest uses OFDM waveforms for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging of a target area into which a digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) repeat jammer has been introduced. The jammer attempts to introduce false targets into the final image by replicating the radar transmitted waveform. SAR images are often constructed using a back projection algorithm requiring the presence of a false target to rely heavily on the matched filter (MF) output of the radar and jamming signals. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to determine probability density functions for maximum MF output for both cross-correlation and auto-correlation of the random OFDM waveforms containing WGN. A MF threshold is then chosen and probability of false alarm and probability of detection are simulated for varying SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977015","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977015.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of random OFDM radar signals in deception jamming scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977015/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of random OFDM radar signals in deception jamming scenarios","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10685959","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977015/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of random OFDM radar signals in deception jamming scenarios","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052598S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4977020,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center (GEDC), Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lee","id":"37598679000"},{"name":"Sangjun An","affiliation":["Georgia Electronic Design Center (GEDC), Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sangjun","lastName":"An","id":"37403421300"},{"name":"Sang M.

This method is conceptually different from other classical algorithms, achieving a high azimuth resolution using relatively short array.

The existing matched filter (MF) detectors suit and are applicable to radar target detection in the presence of compound-Gaussian clutter. However, in view of scanning while detecting in a radar the textural component of the compound-Gaussian clutter exhibits a correlation which is less than unity. Therefore, it was needed to model the clutter in compound-Gaussian form considering partial correlation of texture and clutter modulation which arises as a result of antenna scanning. MF based detectors existing in the literature is expected to yield a fall in the detection performance in such clutter environment. Here in this paper, the performance of the existing MF detector is studied in detail for partially correlated texture scenario. Furthermore performance of the detector is mathematically analyzed to show its relationship with the texture correlation value. Analytical and simulation results show that for partially correlated texture the existing MF detector performance degrades significantly as compared to the completely correlated texture case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977047/","accessionNumber":"10685991","displayDocTitle":"Performance deterioration of the matched filter detector in partially correlated texture based compound-Gaussian clutter environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance deterioration of the matched filter detector in partially correlated texture based compound-Gaussian clutter environment","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055916S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4977053,"authors":[{"name":"Salman M.

Additionally, a 200 W travelling wave tube amplifier (TWTA) manufactured by L3 Communications was acquired and characterized. While these devices are typically not the primary sources of origin for phase noise in transponders, they will contribute phase noise and may add to system phase noise differently. Because information on Ka-band tube and solid-state amplifier additive phase noise performance was not available for these high-power Ka-band amplifiers, an investigation into the phase noise of the SSPA and TWTA was launched. Results indicate that the tested SSPA may have a lower close-in phase noise than the tested TWTA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Solid state circuits","Additive noise","Phase noise","High power amplifiers","Testing","Power generation","Propulsion","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit noise","millimetre wave power amplifiers","phase noise","travelling wave amplifiers","travelling wave tubes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid state power amplifier","travelling wave tube amplifier","additive phase noise characterization","Ka-band operation","32-way combiner/splitter","Jet Propulsion Laboratory","transponders","GaAs PHEMT MMIC","L3 Communications","power 200 W","frequency 31 GHz to 36 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977053","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977053.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solid state power amplifier and travelling wave tube amplifier additive phase noise characterization at Ka-band operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solid state power amplifier and travelling wave tube amplifier additive phase noise characterization at Ka-band operation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977053/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977053/","accessionNumber":"10685996","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solid state power amplifier and travelling wave tube amplifier additive phase noise characterization at Ka-band operation","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036192S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4977058,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Dadello","affiliation":["Mimix Asia, North Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Dadello","id":"37293796300"},{"name":"Anthony P.

The integration of these functions allows compact assemblies with low inter-stage losses to be realised while the use of a commercial 6-inch foundry reduces cost. High density applications are made more practicable through the high PAE achieved (40 to 45%), thus easing the heat management problems associated with phased-array applications at high frequencies. The typical mid-band RMS magnitude variation is 1.3 dB with an RMS phase error of 6 degrees, an input return loss of 10 dB and output return loss of 15 dB for all states.

Important mission objectives are global forest height and biomass inventories, large scale measurements of millimetric displacements due to tectonic shifts, and systematic observations of glacier movements. The innovative mission concept and the high data acquisition capacity of Tandem-L provide a unique data source to observe, analyze and quantify the dynamics of a wide range of mutually interacting processes in the bio-, litho-, hydro- and cryosphere. By this, Tandem-L will be an essential step to advance our understanding of the Earth system and its intricate dynamics.

Practical radar requirements such as unit peak-to-average power ratio and range compression dictate that we use MIMO radar waveforms that have constant modulus and good auto- and cross-correlation properties. We present in this paper new computationally efficient cyclic algorithms for MIMO radar waveform synthesis. These algorithms can be used for the design of unimodular MIMO sequences that have very low auto-and cross-correlation sidelobes in a specified lag interval, and of very long sequences that could hardly be handled by other algorithms previously suggested in the literature. A number of examples are provided to demonstrate the performances of the new waveform synthesis algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977095.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unimodular sequence sets with good correlations for MIMO radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar antennas","Transmitting antennas","Aperture antennas","Algorithm design and analysis","Covariance matrix","Design optimization","Councils","Helium","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiinput multioutput radar system","unimodular sequence sets","orthogonal waveforms","phased-array antenna","peak-to-average power ratio","MIMO radar waveform synthesis algorithm","cross-correlation sidelobes","very low auto correlation sidelobes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Unimodular sequence sets with good correlations for MIMO radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977095/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10686036","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unimodular sequence sets with good correlations for MIMO radar","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091966S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4977126,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Two signaling methods, namely continuous carrier transmission and Gaussian-OFDM signals are studied with respect to the sidelobe mitigation properties.

When providing these additional degrees of freedom for target tracking, MIMO radar exhibits a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when compared to that of traditional single-input multiple-output (SIMO) phased array radar. Previous work has indicated the efficacy of combining MIMO operation with space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques in the presence of multipath clutter to improve the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). The tradeoff between target SNR and SCNR in multipath propagation environments is a crucial consideration in MIMO radar. In this paper, a transmit-receive directionality spectrum (TRDS) is used to examine the clutter characteristics at a range-Doppler bin of interest, most notably in multipath situations where MIMO operation is advantageous. In situations where ground clutter is spread in Doppler frequency and azimuth by motion in the propagation environment, the clutter rank can be significantly higher than a Brennan's rule estimate. However, the transmit observability within the MIMO data vector allows for a low rank representation of the clutter when compared to the total available degrees of freedom. A TRDS-based method based on the resolution limits of uniformly spaced linear transmit and receive arrays is presented which furnishes an estimate of the transmit-receive clutter rank in scenarios where Brennans rule provides a significantly underestimated measure. The proposed TRDS-based clutter rank estimation method is applied to both numerical simulations and experimental data.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977137","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977137.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO enabled multipath clutter rank estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977137/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO enabled multipath clutter rank estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10686076","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977137/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO enabled multipath clutter rank estimation","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091424S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4977138,"authors":[{"name":"Xiufeng Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Comp.

However, the mutual interference among the waveforms may lead to considerable performance degradation suppressing clutter near targets. In this paper, we consider the use of space time coding (STC) to mitigate waveform cross-correlation effects in MIMO radar. First, it turns out that a joint waveform optimization problem can be decoupled into a set of individual waveform design problems. Second, a number of monostatic waveforms can be directly used in a MIMO radar system, which offers flexibility in waveform selection. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of STC in MIMO radar for waveform decorrelation.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977138","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977138.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced multistatic radar resolution via STC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977138/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced multistatic radar resolution via STC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10686077","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977138/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced multistatic radar resolution via STC","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046875S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4977139,"authors":[{"name":"Yannick Lasne","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Lasne","id":"37273696000"},{"name":"Philippe Paillou","affiliation":["Observatoire Aquitain des Sciences de l'Univers, LAB-UMR, Floirac, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Paillou","id":"37273694500"},{"name":"Anthony Freeman","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Freeman","id":"37273702100"},{"name":"Bruce Chapman","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Chapman","id":"37269426000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2870-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2871-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-5659"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5318"}],"articleNumber":"4977139","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Dielectric constant","Soil","Backscatter","Analytical models","Dielectric measurements","Performance evaluation","Laboratories","Electromagnetic analysis","Signal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geochemistry","moisture","radar cross-sections","soil","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyper-saline deposits monitoring","Death Valley","salinity","airborne-spaceborne SAR imagery","electromagnetic characterization","salt-water mixtures","IEM simulations","C-band","L-band","Cottonball Basin saltpan","copolar backscattering ratio","seasonal variations","dielectric properties","California","USA","soil moisture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ALOS/PALSAR","AIRSAR","evaporites","copolar phase difference","Death Valley","IEM","radar backscattering","salinity","SAR","soil moisture","SIR-C"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977139","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR imagery applied to the monitoring of hyper-saline deposits: Death Valley example (CA)","abstract":"The present study aims at understanding the influence of salinity on the dielectric constant of soils and then on the backscattering coefficients recorded by airborne/spaceborne SAR systems.

Our analytical simulations allow to reproduce specific copolar signatures recorded in SAR data, corresponding to the Cottonball Basin saltpan.

This is achieved by making full use of the areal extent of a reflector antenna on receive. The SweepSAR rate is not as big a problem as it might appear initially: note that in the 30 years since Seasat launched downlink rates for LEO satellites have increased significantly - from ~85 Mbps up to ~640 Mbps. In addition, analog-to digital converters (ADCs) have increased in bandwidth from ~ 20 MHz to several GHz. In this paper, an alternative approach is described that is suited for longer wavelength SARs in particular, employing a large, deployable reflector antenna and a much simpler phased array feed. To illuminate a wide swath, a substantial fraction of the phased array feed is excited on transmit to sub-illuminate the reflector. Shorter transmit pulses are required than for conventional SAR. On receive, a much smaller portion of the phased array feed is used to collect the return echo, so that a greater portion of the reflector antenna area is used. The locus of the portion of the phased array used on receive is adjusted using an analog beam steering network, to 'sweep' the receive beam(s) across the illuminated swath, tracking the return echo. This is similar in some respects to the whiskbroom approach to optical sensors, hence the name: SweepSAR. SweepSAR has advantages over conventional SAR in that it requires less transmit power, and if the receive beam is narrow enough, it is relatively immune to range ambiguities. Compared to direct radiating arrays with digital beam-forming, it is much simpler to implement, uses currently available technologies, is better suited for longer wavelength systems, and does not require extremely high data rates or onboard processing.","doi":"10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977140","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925655/4976913/04977140.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RADAR.2009.4977140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976913","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SweepSAR: Beam-forming on receive using a reflector-phased array feed combination for spaceborne SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SweepSAR: Beam-forming on receive using a reflector-phased array feed combination for spaceborne SAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977140/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10686079","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977140/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SweepSAR: Beam-forming on receive using a reflector-phased array feed combination for spaceborne SAR","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076598S","chronDate":"4-8 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4925655","isNumber":"4976913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925655","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4976913","articleId":"4977140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4977160,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Khatim Hasan","affiliation":["Department of Communication Technology and Network, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Khatim","lastName":"Hasan","id":"38182869400"},{"name":"Mohamed Othman","affiliation":["Department of Communication Technology and Network, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Othman","id":"37267998300"},{"name":"Zulkifly Abbas","affiliation":["Department of Physic, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zulkifly","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37297733500"},{"name":"Jumat Sulaiman","affiliation":["School of Science and Technology, Universiti Malaysia, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jumat","lastName":"Sulaiman","id":"37542504000"},{"name":"Rozita Johari","affiliation":["Department of Communication Technology and Network, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rozita","lastName":"Johari","id":"38360714800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0011-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0012-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4977160","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"abstract":"In this paper, a numerical simulation by a new high speed low order FDTD (HSLO-FDTD) method will be conducted to simulate one dimensional free space wave propagation of 2.4 GHz Gaussian pulse.

By applying non-uniformly spaced modulation constellations, i.e., hierarchical modulation constellations, we show that multiple services with different QoS requirements or the same service of randomly located multiple users in a cell can be supported simultaneously. In a MIMO cellular system as specified by 3GPP/3GPP2 work group, we present both the link-level and system-level simulation results. The link-level simulations shows the great potentials of the proposed scheme to provide unequal error protections. The system-level simulations consider two application scenarios: single user with multiple services and single service to multiple users, and show that the proposed scheme requires less average transmission power at the base station than the traditional TDMA system with uniformly spaced QAM modulation. It is also shown that the peak transmission power will be reduced. This scheme can be used to increase the size of the future cellular cell or the number of users in each cell.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 1st International Conference on Computers, Communications, & Signal Processing with Special Track on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925072/4977146/04977163.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"2005 1st International Conference on Computers, Communications, & Signal Processing with Special Track on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCSP.2005.4977163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCSP.2005.4977163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical modulation for the downlink of MIMO multi-user channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Base stations","Transmitting antennas","Error correction codes","Power system protection","Data communication","Quality of service","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical modulation for the downlink of MIMO multi-user channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977163/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical modulation for the downlink of MIMO multi-user channels","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1568968264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059536S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4925072","isNumber":"4977146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925072","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4977146","articleId":"4977163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977164,"authors":[{"name":"Jahangir Dadkhah Chimeh","affiliation":["Next Gen.

In a DOCDMA system, the central wavelength of electrically controlled tunable optical filter (TOF) at the transmitter is dynamically varied during the bit period according to a functional code. An enhancement of the system is also proposed by clipping the signal at the decoder of each receiver. The system is modeled and analyzed with and without signal clipping taking into account the multiple access interference, thermal noise, and phase induced intensity noise. The performance of the enhanced system is compared with that of a DOCDMA system without signal clipping, fast frequency hopping, and with a spectral amplitude coding system that uses either a Hadamard code, a modified quadratic congruence code, or modified frequency hopping code. The results show that the proposed system improve the bit error rate performance. Signal clipping method reduces the multiple access interference and improve the bit error rate performance of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic optical code division multiple access communication system analysis and performance enhancement by signal clipping","publicationTitle":"2005 1st International Conference on Computers, Communications, & Signal Processing with Special Track on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCSP.2005.4977173","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 1st International Conference on Computers, Communications, & Signal Processing with Special Track on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4925072/4977146/04977173.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCSP.2005.4977173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic optical code division multiple access communication system analysis and performance enhancement by signal clipping","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977173/","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic optical code division multiple access communication system analysis and performance enhancement by signal clipping","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1568964084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062234S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4925072","isNumber":"4977146","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4925072","xplore-issue":"4977146","articleId":"4977173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4977175,"authors":[{"name":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","id":"37291209500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0011-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0012-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4977175","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Receivers","Interference","Hardware","Decoding","Data models","Quality of service","Degradation","Detectors","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS/CDMA","two-stage receiver","post-combining"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a two-stage decoding scheme is proposed for direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS/CDMA) systems.

Finally, the subcode weights are converted back into a full-dimension weight vector acting on the original code via a dimension recovery transformation and post-combining.

While highly capable chips, these monolithic image sensors devote substantial perimeter area to signal acquisition and control circuitry and trade off pixel complexity for fill factor. For applications such as wide-area persistent surveillance, reconnaissance, and astronomical sky surveys it is desirable to have simultaneous near-real-time imagery with fast, wide field-of-view coverage. Since the fabrication of a complex large-format sensor on a single piece of silicon is cost and yield-prohibitive and is limited to the wafer size, for these applications many smaller-sized image sensors are tiled together to realize very large arrays. Ideally the tiled image sensor has no missing pixels and the pixel pitch is continuous across the seam to minimize loss of information content. CCD-based imagers have been favored for these large mosaic arrays because of their low noise and high sensitivity, but CMOS-based image sensors bring architectural benefits, including electronic shutters, enhanced radiation tolerance, and higher data-rate digital outputs that are more easily scalable to larger arrays. In this report the first back-illuminated, 1 Mpixel, 3D-integrated CMOS image sensor with 8 mum-pitch 3D via connections. The chip employs a conventional pixel layout and requires 500 mum of perimeter silicon to house the support circuitry and protect the array from saw damage. In this paper we present a back-illuminated 1 Mpixel CMOS image sensor tile that includes a 64-channel vertically integrated ADC chip stack, and requires only a few pixels of silicon perimeter to the pixel array. The tile and system connector design support 4-side abuttability and fast burst data rates.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977296","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977296.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"39,39a","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4-side tileable back illuminated 3D-integrated Mpixel CMOS image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977296/","displayDocTitle":"A 4-side tileable back illuminated 3D-integrated Mpixel CMOS image sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727891","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977296/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-side tileable back illuminated 3D-integrated Mpixel CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D02_01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045079S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977298,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Kapusta","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Kapusta","id":"38056175900"},{"name":"Hiroto Shinozaki","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroto","lastName":"Shinozaki","id":"38071234500"},{"name":"Eitake Ibaragi","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Eitake","lastName":"Ibaragi","id":"37370723600"},{"name":"Kevin Ni","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Ni","id":"38059891500"},{"name":"Richard Wang","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Wang","id":"38066811000"},{"name":"Mark Sayuk","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Sayuk","id":"37728338200"},{"name":"Larry Singer","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Singer","id":"37352812800"},{"name":"Katsu Nakamura","affiliation":["Analog Devices, Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Katsu","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37347184300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977298","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1409},"abstract":"We present a 4-channel analog front-end (AFE) designed specifically for multichannel sensors used in digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. Multichannel sensors have been adopted as a solution to the increasing requirements for higher throughput in imaging systems. Single-channel AFEs have been published; however, there are drawbacks to using multiple discrete single-channel AFEs in a multichannel system. For example, column readout patterns are particularly sensitive to mismatch between AFE channels. Also, DSLR cameras support many different frame capture modes and read-out patterns, requiring clock rates from below 10MS/s to over 70MS/s, and previous AFEs have not been designed to operate over such a wide range. This paper describes several design techniques developed for the DSLR application, including adaptive power scaling, an integrated reference buffer, and a low-noise sampling technique with sampled thermal noise below kT/C.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital cameras","Crosstalk","Sampling methods","Noise cancellation","Bandwidth","Circuit noise","Capacitors","Parasitic capacitance","Switches","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","cameras","image sensors","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog front-end","sampled thermal noise","digital single-lens reflex cameras","imaging systems","multiple discrete single-channel AFE","multichannel sensors","column readout patterns","DSLR cameras","frame capture modes","clock rates","adaptive power scaling","integrated reference buffer","low-noise sampling technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977298","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977298.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"43,43a","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4-channel 20-to300 Mpixel/s analog front-end with sampled thermal noise below kT/C for digital SLR cameras","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 4-channel 20-to300 Mpixel/s analog front-end with sampled thermal noise below kT/C for digital SLR cameras","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977298/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977298/","accessionNumber":"10755747","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-channel 20-to300 Mpixel/s analog front-end with sampled thermal noise below kT/C for digital SLR cameras","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D02_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08975S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4977299,"authors":[{"name":"Nagataka Tanaka","affiliation":["Toshiba Semiconductor Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Nagataka","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37287340400"},{"name":"Junji Naruse","affiliation":["Toshiba Semiconductor Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Naruse","id":"38060562700"},{"name":"Akiko Mori","affiliation":["Toshiba Semiconductor Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akiko","lastName":"Mori","id":"38057060400"},{"name":"Ryuta Okamoto","affiliation":["Toshiba Semiconductor Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuta","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37294577800"},{"name":"Hirofumi Yamashita","affiliation":["Toshiba Semiconductor Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37287849200"},{"name":"Makoto Monoi","affiliation":["Toshiba Semiconductor Company Limited, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Monoi","id":"37846919300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977299","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":700},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Voltage","Pixel","Image sensors","Turning","Semiconductor device noise","Computational fluid dynamics","Wires","Photodiodes","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","shared-pixel architecture","layout structure","-to-drain capacitance","gate-to-source capacitance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a shared-pixel architecture in which the Gr pixel and the Gb pixel are designed to have the same layout structure, is introduced for suppression of the Gr/Gb sensitivity imbalance.

The key idea is that the capacitor is then discharged to a known voltage before it is recharged in order to equalize the amount of charge provided by the external power supply.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977309","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977309.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"65,65a","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure AES engine with a local switched-capacitor current equalizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Secure AES engine with a local switched-capacitor current equalizer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10772123","htmlLink":"/document/4977309/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure AES engine with a local switched-capacitor current equalizer","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D03_05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10099S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4977312,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Kuppuswamy","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Kuppuswamy","id":"37345606600"},{"name":"Shankar R.

The feasibility of the structure is demonstrated by implementations targeting applications in the 8-to-11 Gb/s and 17-to-20 Gb/s ranges. A key challenge associated with this approach is how to achieve the proportional-path latency and gain required for overall low-noise DPLL performance. In particular, it is well-known that the strong nonlinearity introduced by the BB-PFD manifests itself as a bounded limit cycle. This results in the DPLL output jitter to increase as the proportional path latency and gain increase. To minimize the negative effect of the limit cycle, the DPLL architecture features a separate low-latency proportional path, with the BB- PFD output directly controlling the DCO. Other features include controllability of the proportional-path gain and of the BBPFD gain.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977324","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977324.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","startPage":"94","endPage":"95,95a","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bang-bang digital PLLs at 11 and 20GHz with sub-200fs integrated jitter for high-speed serial communication applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bang-bang digital PLLs at 11 and 20GHz with sub-200fs integrated jitter for high-speed serial communication applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977324/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10772135","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977324/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bang-bang digital PLLs at 11 and 20GHz with sub-200fs integrated jitter for high-speed serial communication applications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D05_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056644S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4977326,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-hyoun Kim","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The most commonly used architecture is a dual-loop CDR where a DLL (or PLL) generates k equidistantly spaced clock phases that are fed into n/2 phase rotators, where n is the number of sampling latches in the CDR. Another method was proposed, where the multi-phase generation and phase shifting is achieved at the same time in a single PLL, in this case achieving phase-adjustment capability through the weighted summing of charge-pump outputs for several phases. This approach eliminates the additional delay associated with using phase rotators and simplifies the overall design. However, all these conventional methods require either a PLL or a DLL, blocks that demand the largest share of power consumption and of silicon area in the CDR circuit. An alternate approach to implementing a phase generator and rotator is described in this paper, with the basic design concept of this approach is also illustrated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Circuit testing","Filters","Phase locked loops","Inverters","Interpolation","Leg","Frequency","Jitter","Phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock and data recovery circuits","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital phase locked loops","microwave generation","MMIC","silicon-on-insulator","UHF generation","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOI CMOS","serial link receiver","all-digital phase generator-rotator","multiphase generator","phase shifting","charge-pump output","power consumption","power 5.4 mW","frequency 0.8 GHz to 5 GHz","size 45 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977326","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977326","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977326","startPage":"98","endPage":"99,99a","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5.4mW 0.0035mm<sup>2</sup> 0.48ps<inf>rms</inf>-jitter 0.8-to-5GHz non-PLL/DLL all-digital phase generator/rotator in 45nm SOI CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 5.4mW 0.0035mm<sup>2</sup> 0.48ps<inf>rms</inf>-jitter 0.8-to-5GHz non-PLL/DLL all-digital phase generator/rotator in 45nm SOI CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977326/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977326/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727899","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5.4mW 0.0035mm<sup>2</sup> 0.48ps<inf>rms</inf>-jitter 0.8-to-5GHz non-PLL/DLL all-digital phase generator/rotator in 45nm SOI CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D05_05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035131S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977334,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Gaborieau","affiliation":["ST-NXP Wireless, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Gaborieau","id":"37938199300"},{"name":"Sven Mattisson","affiliation":["Ericsson Mobile Platforms AB, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Mattisson","id":"37265020200"},{"name":"Nikolaus Klemmer","affiliation":["Ericsson Mobile Platforms AB, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolaus","lastName":"Klemmer","id":"37282443000"},{"name":"Bassem Fahs","affiliation":["ST-NXP Wireless, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Bassem","lastName":"Fahs","id":"38279356100"},{"name":"Fabio T.

The challenge of removing inter-stage filters from multiband 3G receivers (RX) resides in the additional noise contribution due to limited transmitter (TX) leakage rejection at the RX input, intermodulation (IM) products and cross-compression due to TX leakage and strong out-of- band blockers. Increased downconverter dynamic range is thus required for a SAW-less RX path. In addition, avoiding SNR degradation from reciprocal mixing imposes additional constraints on LO phase noise. The presented transceiver integrates all RX and TX functions required to support a tri-band WCDMA/HSPA (bands l-VI, VIII, IX) and quad- band GSM/GPRS/EDGE application in a single chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical

As shown in Fig. 6.5.2, first the IF l/Q voltage inputs are filtered by the passive LPF to lower the far-out noise.

Such operation leads to a direct quadrature voltage modulation. The output of the voltage mixer contains both the desired fundamental LO mixing product, and the unwanted odd-harmonic LO mixing products. For a packaged device the unwanted harmonics can be attenuated below -40dBc by a harmonic filter (formed by the RF output bonding wire and capacitors) after the PA driver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical

However, the number of slots per channel is limited to maintain high bandwidth, making the capacity requirement difficult to meet. Another problem is that computer systems impose a limit on the supply of power since their power dissipation increases rapidly where main memories account for roughly 15% of total power consumption. To address these issues, we design a 4Gb DDR3 SDRAM that supports a 1.2 V supply voltage and 1.6 Gb/s data rate.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977341","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International

However, this limits the input/output (I/O) speed since increased channel loading causes degradation in signal integrity. To overcome the I/O speed limit, several buffered module solutions have been proposed, where data pins are buffered by additional chips. However, this increases power consumption and latency significantly. We present a 3D DRAM with TSVs that overcomes the limits of conventional module approaches. Important architectural aspects, and key 3D technologies such as inter-rank seamless read scheme, TSV check and repair scheme, and a power-noise reduction method are

In addition, 4b data prefetch and a ZQ calibrated output driver scheme are used to achieve 4.3 GB/s/chip (1066 Mb/s/pin) bandwidth with 110 mW power dissipation.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977343","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977343.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.35V 4.3GB/s 1Gb LPDDR2 DRAM with controllable repeater and on-the-fly power-cut scheme for low-power and high-speed mobile application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 1.35V 4.3GB/s 1Gb LPDDR2 DRAM with controllable repeater and on-the-fly power-cut scheme for low-power and high-speed mobile application","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10772145","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977343/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977343/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.35V 4.3GB/s 1Gb LPDDR2 DRAM with controllable repeater and on-the-fly power-cut scheme for low-power and high-speed mobile application","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D07_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055171S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4977345,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Partovi","affiliation":["Qimonda, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Partovi","id":"37352524600"},{"name":"Karthik Gopalakrishnan","affiliation":["Qimonda, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Gopalakrishnan","id":"38061630700"},{"name":"Luca Ravezzi","affiliation":["Qimonda, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Ravezzi","id":"37370212500"},{"name":"Russell Homer","affiliation":["Qimonda, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Homer","id":"38068235500"},{"name":"Otto Schumacher","affiliation":["Qimonda, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Otto","lastName":"Schumacher","id":"37726021000"},{"name":"Reinhold Unterricker","affiliation":["Qimonda, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Reinhold","lastName":"Unterricker","id":"38073453300"},{"name":"Werner Kederer","affiliation":["Qimonda, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Kederer","id":"37294160200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977345","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":2306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Graphics","Circuits","Nonlinear distortion","Bandwidth","Latches","Auxiliary transmitters","Impedance","Strontium","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","convertors","DRAM chips","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-ended transceiver design techniques","high-bandwidth DRAM","signal transmission","single-ended wire","CML-to-CMOS converter","integrated serializer-level-shifter","quadratic BGA package","bit rate 5.33 Gbit/s","size 0.13 mum","voltage 1.2 V"]}],"abstract":"Graphics processing is the driving force behind the demand for high-bandwidth DRAMs. Accelerating the pace of bandwidth improvement, fifth-generation graphics DDRs will operate at data rates up to 5.33 Gb/s, and support single-ended signaling for low pin-count.

Full-HD video processing requires six times the data bandwidth and is more computationally intensive than conventional standard-definition (SD) video. The trade-off between flexibility, performance and power consumption is a key focus of video-codec design. Homogeneous multi-core processors are power-consuming and achieving high-throughput is difficult. While dedicated circuits can minimize power consumption, the dedicated decoders and encoders in previous reports have difficulty performing all of the media processing that is indispensable for a modern cellular phone. In this paper, we have integrated a mobile application processor featuring a two-stage-processing video codec, tile-based address-translation circuits, and several audio/visual intellectual property (IP) modules. The circuit diagram and visualization are also illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977356","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977356.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","startPage":"158","endPage":"159,159a","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 342mW mobile application processor with full-HD multi-standard video codec","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 342mW mobile application processor with full-HD multi-standard video codec","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977356/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727914","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977356/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 342mW mobile application processor with full-HD multi-standard video codec","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D08_07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049576S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977369,"authors":[{"name":"Seon-Kyoo Lee","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seon-Kyoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407206100"},{"name":"Young-Sang Kim","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Sang","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406994300"},{"name":"Hyunsoo Ha","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyunsoo Ha","id":"37087789944"},{"name":"Younghun Seo","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Younghun Seo","id":"37087819725"},{"name":"Hong-June Park","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-June","lastName":"Park","id":"37277119400"},{"name":"Jae-Yoon Sim","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Yoon Sim","id":"37087447296"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977369","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Clocks","Phase detection","Bit rate","Frequency locked loops","Jitter","Solid state circuits","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Phase frequency detector","Pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock and data recovery circuits","clocks","digital phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DLL-based frequency acquisition","dual-loop CDR","referenceless CDR circuit","data rate automatic acquisition","power consumption","bit rate 650 Mbit/s to 8 Gbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977369","abstract":"The CDR circuit is a key enabling block in high-speed serial links.

This human centric communication paradigm can be used for wireless body-area networks to reduce the impact of interference on/from RF systems, to avoid the fading effect that the body has on radio systems and to enable power efficient, high data-rate wireless links. In this work 1.2 V digital signals for TX are used, an RX band of 1 to 30 MHz is chosen and a new robust BCC architecture is proposed that altogether provide reliable performance in the presence of interference. The measured BER and jitter show that performance competitive to the cognitive FSK approach can be achieved with a simpler implementation.

In a conventional LNA, there is a tradeoff between the intrinsic input capacitance of the input transistors and the achievable bandwidth (BW) of the amplifier. This makes it necessary to use smaller transistors at higher gate overdrive voltages to simultaneously achieve greater BW and better NF. Unfortunately, biasing the transistor in this fashion yields a power-inefficient design. Furthermore, the need for a smaller capacitance presents a challenge to electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection of the input due to its added capacitance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact low-noise weighted distributed amplifier in CMOS","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977387","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977387.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"221,221a","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A compact low-noise weighted distributed amplifier in CMOS","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977387/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact low-noise weighted distributed amplifier in CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D12_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030573S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977390,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Pellerano","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Pellerano","id":"37294497900"},{"name":"Paolo Madoglio","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Madoglio","id":"37296092800"},{"name":"Yorgos Palaskas","affiliation":["Intel, Hillsboro, OR"],"firstName":"Yorgos","lastName":"Palaskas","id":"37297626300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977390","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977390","abstract":"Local-oscillator (LO) pulling is a typical issue in fully integrated transceivers. To offset the oscillator frequency from the PA output frequency, SSB mixing or division-by-2 is typically used. However, the first might require additional filtering to remove mixing spurs and the latter is still sensitive to second-harmonic pulling. The divider described in this paper prevents LO pulling by introducing a fractional ratio between input and output frequencies. Since fractional spurs are suppressed by digital calibration, no additional filtering is required, removing inductors and saving silicon area.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","startPage":"226","endPage":"227,227a","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977390.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 4.75GHz fractional frequency divider with digital spur calibration in 45nm CMOS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency conversion","Calibration","Solid state circuits","Delay","Signal resolution","Temperature","Frequency synthesizers","Radio frequency","RF signals","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","frequency dividers","microwave oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional frequency divider","digital spur calibration","CMOS","fully integrated transceivers","SSB mixing","second-harmonic pulling","fractional ratio","size 45 nm","frequency 4.75 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 4.75GHz fractional frequency divider with digital spur calibration in 45nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977390/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977390/","accessionNumber":"10727941","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4.75GHz fractional frequency divider with digital spur calibration in 45nm CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D12_06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052131S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4977392,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Besides harmonic and intermodulation distortion (HD/IMD), OBI can also lead to blocking and harmonic mixing. A wideband LNA amplifies signal and interference with equal gain. Even a low gain of 6dB can clip OdBm OBI to a 1.2V supply, blocking the receiver. Hard-switching mixers not only translate the wanted signal to baseband but also the interference around LO harmonics. Harmonic rejection (HR) mixers have been used, but are sensitive to phase and gain mismatch. Indeed the HR in shows a large spread, whereas other work only shows results from one chip. This paper describes techniques to relax blocking and HD/IMD, and make HR robust to mismatch.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977392.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"231,231a","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A software-defined radio receiver architecture robust to out-of-band interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Robustness","Interference","Noise measurement","Filtering","Degradation","Wideband","Filters","Radio frequency","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifiers","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software-defined radio receiver architecture","harmonic and intermodulation distortion","wideband LNA","hard-switching mixers","harmonic rejection mixers","gain 6 dB","voltage 1.2 V"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A software-defined radio receiver architecture robust to out-of-band interference","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977392/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727943","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A software-defined radio receiver architecture robust to out-of-band interference","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D12_08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056313S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977393,"authors":[{"name":"Niels A.

HR schemes are often used, but amplitude and phase mismatches limit HR to between 30 and 40 dB. A quick calculation shows that much more rejection is wanted: in order to bring harmonic responses down to the noise floor (e.g. -100 dBm in 10 MHz for 4 dB NF), and cope with interferers between -40 and 0 dBm, an HR of 60 to 100 dB is needed. Also in terrestrial TV receivers and in applications like DVB-H with co-existence requirements with GSM/WLAN transmitters in a small telephone, high HR is needed. In this work, an architecture aiming for >80 dB HR is shown. It consists of an analog front-end followed by adaptive interference cancellation (AIC) in the digital domain. AIC is known for its ability to adapt to and mitigate unknown system non-idealities, e.g. gain and phase imbalances. Due to its adaptivity it can achieve large improvements, provided the interference estimate is accurate. To the authors' knowledge, they are the first to explore AIC for HR and previously presented simulation results. Here a new and different architecture and measured results with the RF part implemented in 65 nm CMOS and the AIC in software are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977393","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE

As seen in the growing needs for applications such as solid-state drives and video camcoders, the market demands for larger-capacity storage has continuously increased and NAND flash memories are enabling a wide range of new applications. In such situations, to achieve larger capacity at low cost per bit, technical improvement in feature-size scaling, multi-bit per cell and area reduction are essential. To respond to such continuous requirements of cost reduction and density increase, 32 Gb 3 b/cell (D3) NAND flash memory with sub-35 nm CMOS process is developed. Introduction of sub-35 nm CMOS process and D3 technology doubles the capacity at almost the same chip area compared to previously published 43 nm 16 Gb 2 b/cell (D2) chip and about 80% chip area compared to previously published 56 nm 16 Gb D3 chip.

Especially stringent requirements are imposed on the DACs for AMLCD data drivers: uniform performance in each data channel, and compactness in chip implementation, as well as extremely low power consumption. The prevalent use of resistor-DAC (RDAC) architectures is partly owing to their uniform characteristics, because each RDAC in the data channels shares a common resistor string for reference voltage. In this paper, a piecewise-linear 10 b DAC architecture is introduced. An interpolation scheme with drain-current modulation shows uniform channel performance, and keeps the 10 b data driver size smaller than that of a conventional 8 b driver. The DAC architecture requires no modification to the conventional data-driver structure except for the addition of a minimal number of circuits for drain-current modulation.

In order to satisfy strict specifications, a column-parallel ADC is a key element in a state-of-the-art CIS. However, this architecture leads to side-effects such as vertical fixed pattern noise (VFPN) and read noise. In order to reduce these non-idealities, several techniques can be applied such as digital CDS using a single-slope ADC, and pre-amplified digital CDS using a SAR ADC. It is challenging to overcome the difficulty of compatibility between ADC speed and bit resolution, while maintaining low-noise performance and high dynamic range (DR). In this paper, a low-noise high-DR and high-speed CIS with a 13b column-parallel cyclic ADC based on a single-ended architecture is presented. The cyclic ADC requires 12 cycles for 13b resolution. The ADC requires identical conversions for reset and signals, within the limited horizontal time period, at a frame rate of over 300 fps, so as to achieve perfect digital CDS and ultra-low VFPN. In addition, lower total read noise is achieved without signal amplification by removing: (1) dual analog paths in fully differential circuits, (2) a common reference route, and (3) digital coupling noise. Published cyclic ADCs that are located in the column of a CIS have column pitch of 15 mum or larger. The circuits with the single-ended architecture presented in this paper are squeezed into 5.6 mum column pitch and can be applied to 2.8 mum-pitch pixels with double-side disposition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977411.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"269,269a","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.1e- vertical FPN 4.7e- read noise 71dB DR CMOS image sensor with 13b column-parallel single-ended cyclic ADCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Capacitors","Image converters","Circuits","Switches","Dynamic range","Computational Intelligence Society","Linearity","Signal resolution","Image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS image sensors","image resolution","integrated circuit noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","column-parallel single-ended cyclic ADC","vertical fixed pattern noise","SAR ADC","signal amplification","dual analog path","differential circuit","common reference route","digital coupling noise","pixel resolution","noise figure 71 dB","size 5.6 mum","size 2.8 mum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 0.1e- vertical FPN 4.7e- read noise 71dB DR CMOS image sensor with 13b column-parallel single-ended cyclic ADCs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977411/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727953","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.1e- vertical FPN 4.7e- read noise 71dB DR CMOS image sensor with 13b column-parallel single-ended cyclic ADCs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D15_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047292S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977415,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Hung Tsai","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kun-Hung","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37574924400"},{"name":"Shen-Iuan Liu","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shen-Iuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280143000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977415","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1737},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Frequency conversion","Phase noise","Solid state circuits","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Semiconductor device measurement","Voltage","Noise measurement","Phase measurement","Injection-locked oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","millimetre wave filters","millimetre wave oscillators","phase locked loops","power dividers","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase locked loop","CMOS integrated circuit","W-band application","VCO design","low-power divider chain","2nd-order loop filter","charge pump circuit","frequency 96 GHz","power 43.7 mW","size 65 nm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a 96 GHz PLL, implemented in 65 nm CMOS, is presented that target W-band applications.

An actual and pervasive adoption of radar technology requires the development of low-cost Silicon-integrated sensors, including microwave, analog, and digital blocks on a single chip, able to replace existing discrete electronics based on compound semiconductors. Indeed, the considerable advantage of silicon lies in its natural capability for integration that will enable a higher level of complexity in such sensors. This paper presents a fully integrated 24GHz UWD radar sensor implemented in a 0.13mum SiGe BiCMOS process. The UWB signal generation takes advantage of a PLL. The produced 24.125GHz carrier is properly BPSK modulated to increase sensor robustness within the entire SRR sensor network.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977430","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977430.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"307,307a","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully integrated 24GHz UWB radar sensor for automotive applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977430/","displayDocTitle":"A fully integrated 24GHz UWB radar sensor for automotive applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727969","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977430/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully integrated 24GHz UWB radar sensor for automotive applications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D18_01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089599S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4977432,"authors":[{"name":"Yoichi Kawano","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Kawano","id":"37264869200"},{"name":"Toshihide Suzuki","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihide","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37276138000"},{"name":"Masaru Sato","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"Sato","id":"37290041100"},{"name":"Tatsuya Hirose","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37267175800"},{"name":"Kazukiyo Joshin","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazukiyo","lastName":"Joshin","id":"37266834300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977432","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":2130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977432","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Circuits","Transmitters","Semiconductor device measurement","Signal generators","Radio frequency","Power generation","Power amplifiers","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","millimetre wave receivers","radar receivers","radar transmitters","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transceiver chip","CMOS technology","millimeter-wave regime","automotive radar","frequency 77 GHz","size 90 nm"]}],"abstract":"CMOS technology is being advanced rapidly and applications are now expanding into the millimeter-wave regime on a global basis. 60 GHz wireless systems in CMOS have already been reported.

The limited energy from power sources, typically either microfabricated batteries or scavenged energy, remains one of the biggest challenges for such platforms. Reducing power consumption can lower system volume and extend lifetime. To achieve very low power consumption aggressive voltage scaling has been applied in recent microsystems. The average power consumption of sensor platforms, which are often low duty cycle, can be greatly reduced by applying strong power gating while idling. A key component in power gating is the timekeeping device while the system is in the idle mode. Since the timer is always active, it is often the dominant source for energy loss and must oscillate at a low frequency (e.g., from sub-Hzto 10Hz).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977440.pdf","endPage":"327,327a","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 150pW program-and-hold timer for ultra-low-power sensor platforms","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977440","startPage":"326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 150pW program-and-hold timer for ultra-low-power sensor platforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977440/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10727978","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977440/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 150pW program-and-hold timer for ultra-low-power sensor platforms","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D19_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034606S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4977451,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Bennati","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Bennati","id":"37590759600"},{"name":"Federico Thei","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Thei","id":"37590759100"},{"name":"Michele Rossi","affiliation":["Silicon Biosystems, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"38546574900"},{"name":"Marco Crescentini","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Crescentini","id":"37590762800"},{"name":"Gennaro D'Avino","affiliation":["University of Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"firstName":"Gennaro","lastName":"D'Avino","id":"37085951871"},{"name":"Andrea Baschirotto","affiliation":["University of Salerno, Lecce, Italy","University of Milano-Bicocca, Milano, Italy","University of Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Baschirotto","id":"37277065100"},{"name":"Marco Tartagni","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Tartagni","id":"37275653900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977451","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1390},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977451","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Nanobioscience","Circuit noise","Low-frequency noise","Switches","Bandwidth","Biosensors","Capacitors","Sensor arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","analogue-digital conversion","nanosensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-pA DeltaSigma current amplifier","single-molecule nanosensors","temperature 293 K to 298 K","current 150 fA","frequency 1 kHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a circuit approach based on a current-mode DeltaSigma converter having a noise floor below 150 fA\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n at 1kHz and at room temperature.

A quadruple loop architecture is introduced in the CDR circuit of the RX, resulting in a 38 Gb/s error-free operation (BER < 101Z) at 231-1 PRBS with a low rms jitter of 210 fs in the recovered clock.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977456","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977456.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","startPage":"358","endPage":"359,359a","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 40Gb/s multi-data-rate CMOS transceiver chipset with SFI-5 interface for optical transmission systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977456/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10727992","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40Gb/s multi-data-rate CMOS transceiver chipset with SFI-5 interface for optical transmission systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D21_01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071724S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4977464,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Roderick","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Roderick","id":"38491552600"},{"name":"Hossein Hashemi","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Hashemi","id":"37275623700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977464","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1008},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977464","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Clocks","Frequency","Jitter","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Solid state circuits","Flip-flops","Phase noise","Phase detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","image resolution","power amplifiers","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS power amplifier","ultrawide instantaneous bandwidth","imaging application","UWB PA","beam-forming systems","image resolution","size 0.13 mum"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the realization of an integrated 0.13 mum CMOS power amplifier that is suitable for signals with an ultra-wide instantaneous bandwidth.

Efficiency of the PA is also paramount for portable consumer electronic applications operating from a battery, such as short-range Gb/s communication SoCs operating in the unlicensed bands around 60 GHz.

The first of the two PAs to be described consists of two common-source (CS) stages, together with matching networks at the input, output and between the stages. The second PA uses the same interstage matching network and is constructed in a push-pull (PP) configuration. To achieve a differential push-pull operation, a novel center-tapped transformer is used. Moreover, the transformer also provides the output matching of the push-pull PA. Both circuits are fully ESD protected in the RF path and in the bias network. Operated at 1.1V, these amplifiers provide a wideband 1dB compression point (P1dB) and saturated (Psat) output power within the 50-to-67 GHz band.

In implantable applications, SoCs are designed under very stringent power and area constraints. The analog and mixed-signal circuits as well as digital circuits in those SoCs require a clock source, because clock-based signal-processing techniques, such as sampling and chopper stabilization, are often used. The primary clock source for such SoCs needs to provide good accuracy and long-term stability of the oscillation frequency foscto minimize variations and drifts of the system characteristics. A fairly pure clock signal is required to avoid signal distortion when sampling or chopping techniques are applied. Considering such a source is typically a free-running oscillator, and biomedical signals of typical interest reside at low frequencies, the close-in phase noise is important. For implantable biomedical sensor SoCs, due to high power consumption of quartz crystal oscillators and their bulky size, monolithic oscillators are preferred as a primary clock source. Relaxation oscillators can operate with low power and set their oscillation period Tosc in well-defined manner while consuming small silicon area. However, their performance is limited by process variations, noisy current sources, and noise and offset voltages of the comparators. Geraedts et al. presented an idea of subtracting a fixed charge packet and filtering out the comparator noise to improve the phase noise particularly at large offset frequencies. In this work, a self-clocked offset-cancellation scheme is presented for comparators in the relaxation oscillator, resulting in smaller frequency drifts and lower close-in phase fluctuations, which are more relevant parameters for primary clock sources in implantable biomedical SoCs.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977478","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference -

has resulted in emerging standards such as IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX), which enable high data-rate communication over wide area coverage. Seamless switching between WiMAX and WLAN is envisioned as a means to enable users to stay connected anywhere and anytime. A low-cost low-power small-form-factor dual-mode (802.16e and 802.11b/g/n) dual-band (2.3G to 2.7G and 3.3G to 3.9G) 2x2 MIMO direct-conversion radio in 90 nm CMOS has been developed to address this rapidly growing market. The transceiver supports wide dual-frequency bands and multiple signal bandwidths of 3.5, 5, 7,10,14, 20, and 40 MHz for worldwide dual-mode operations. Many key challenges in WiMAX direct-conversion transceiver design stem from its small subcarrier spacing, which is necessary to combat multipath fading of OFDM signals in 125 km/h mobile vehicular environments. With the first subcarrier as close as 7.8125 kHz to DC, stringent requirements are imposed on RX and TX flicker noise, TX LO leakage, and LO settling time. Flicker noise in RX is greatly reduced with the adoption of a passive mixer. Several other circuit techniques, system optimizations, and build-in self-calibrations including DC offset with dynamic bandwidth control, IQ mismatch, TX LO leakage, filter bandwidth, LO frequency and amplitude calibrations are used to accomplish high transceiver performance. The chip also achieves excellent WiMAX/WiFi/BIuetooth/GPS/cellular co-existence performance owing to high RX linearity, robust high dynamic range RX AGC with smart blocker detection, and low TX noise. Ultra-wide RX input-signal dynamic range with EVM of better than -35dB to support MIMO 64-QAM OFDM application is achieved. A well-balanced TX gain control scheme is devised to obtain a very wide range of output power with EVM better than -35 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977485","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977485.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","startPage":"416","endPage":"417,417a","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully integrated 2\u00d72 MIMO dual-band dual- mode direct-conversion CMOS transceiver for WiMAX/WLAN applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fully integrated 2\u00d72 MIMO dual-band dual- mode direct-conversion CMOS transceiver for WiMAX/WLAN applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977485/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727852","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977485/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully integrated 2\u00d72 MIMO dual-band dual- mode direct-conversion CMOS transceiver for WiMAX/WLAN applications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D24_05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052985S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977494,"authors":[{"name":"Tung-Chien Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tung-Chien","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276681700"},{"name":"Kuanfu Chen","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA"],"firstName":"Kuanfu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536430200"},{"name":"Zhi Yang","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538725400"},{"name":"Kimberly Cockerham","affiliation":["Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"firstName":"Kimberly","lastName":"Cockerham","id":"37086763107"},{"name":"Wentai Liu","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA"],"firstName":"Wentai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279763700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977494","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":842},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural prosthesis","Sorting","Principal component analysis","Epilepsy","Prosthetics","Sensor arrays","Covariance matrix","Logic gates","Feature extraction","Implants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electrodes","brain","closed loop systems","lab-on-a-chip","medical control systems","multiprocessing systems","neurophysiology","pacemakers","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical multiprocessor SoC","closed-loop neuroprosthetic application","controlled motor prostheses","implantable electrode array","multichannel recording IC","processing-and-controlling system","hippocampal prostheses","brain pacemaker"]}],"abstract":"Successful proof-of-concept laboratory experiments on cortically controlled motor prostheses, brain pacemakers and hippocampal prostheses motivate continued development for neural prosthetic systems.

Magnetically labeled biosensors are proposed as a promising candidate to potentially eliminate or augment the optical instruments used by conventional fluorescence-based sensors. However magnetic biosensors developed thus far require externally generated magnetic biasing fields and/or exotic post-fabrication processes. This limits the ultimate form-factor of the system, total power consumption, and cost. To address these impediments, we present a low-power scalable frequency- shift magnetic particle biosensor array in bulk CMOS, which provides single- bead detection sensitivity without any (electrical or permanent) external magnets.

As each controller regulates the output in time-multiplexed manner, it is difficult to extend the number of outputs and power capacity. The converter reported in solves these limitations by adopting comparator-controlled method. Each comparator-controlled output receives its required energy and one final PWM controller adjusts the total inductor current so that the remaining current is adequate for the last output. However, as the PWM controller regulates one of the converter outputs, the response of controller becomes slow and voltage ripple of the other outputs increases when the load current of PWM-controlled output is reduced to zero (or near zero). As a possible solution, minimum bleeding current can be set for the last output, however, this approach degrades the efficiency at light-load condition. Also, the operation region of the previously reported multiple- output converters is restricted to step-up mode only.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977498","startPage":"442","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977498.pdf","endPage":"443,443a","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977498/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-output step-up/down switching DC-DC converter with vestigial current control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977498/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10727863","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-output step-up/down switching DC-DC converter with vestigial current control","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D26_01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044666S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977500,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Su","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Su","id":"37288594700"},{"name":"Wing-Hung Ki","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wing-Hung","lastName":"Ki","id":"37269638700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977500","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2531},"abstract":"The rapid advancement of processor technology has posed stringent challenges on power supply design. For high efficiency, switching converters are used. Frequent load switching requires the converters to have fast load transient response with recovery times in the order of mus, and therefore the switching frequency in the MHz range. The transient overshoot and undershoot voltages must be within 10% of the output voltage, and such specifications are difficult to meet for a processor core voltage of 0.8V. For fast load transient, inductor current should be fed forward to the PWM generator, which needs a high performance integrated current sensor. In the output feedforward (or V\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) converter, inductor current is sensed by the equivalent series resistor (ESR) of the output capacitor instead.

The output voltage, V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n, is fed back to the error-correction path (ECP) for precision output voltage control, and V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n is also directly fed to the PWM generator through the feedforward path (FFP).

Despite the advances in process technologies and the resultant ability to produce ever-smaller feature sizes, the increasing variations of scaled devices in SRAM are playing an increasingly important role in determining the scaling of SRAM operating voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cc</sub>\n), frequency and leakage power. We develop a high-performance voltage-scalable SRAM design in 32 nm logic CMOS featuring 2nd-generation high-k metal-gate transistors and 4th-generation strained silicon. With the continued transistor performance enhancement and extensive process-circuit co-optimization, the 32 nm SRAM design is able to achieve 2times improvement in density and 15% faster access speed when compared to the 45 nm design at the same voltage. The design supports a broad range of operating voltages to enable dynamic voltage scaling in today's high-performance and low-power applications. The design also features an integrated power management scheme with close-loop array leakage control, floating bitline and wordline driver sleep, resulting in 58% reduction of SRAM leakage consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977505/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977505/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10727869","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 4.0 GHz 291Mb voltage-scalable SRAM design in 32nm high-\u03ba metal-gate CMOS with integrated power management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4.0 GHz 291Mb voltage-scalable SRAM design in 32nm high-\u03ba metal-gate CMOS with integrated power management","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D27_01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045752S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4977506,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Therefore, 2 to 16 Mb standalone MRAMs have been developed. However, in terms of their random-access times, they are not enough fast (25ns) as substitutes for all kinds of stand-alone DRAMs or SRAMs. To attain a standalone MRAM with both a fast random-access time and a large capacity, we adopt a cell structure with 2 transistors and 1 magnetic tunneling junction (2T1 MTJ), which we previously published for a 1 Mb embedded MRAM macro. We need to develop circuit schemes to achieve a larger memory capacity and a higher cell-occupation ratio with small access-time degradation. We describe the circuit schemes of a 32 Mb MRAM, which enable 63% cell occupation ratio and 12 ns access time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Driver

The 26 dB amplifier provides 7 dB more gain than recent W-band work in 0.12 mum SiGe.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977521","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977521.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"489,489a","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 26dB-gain 100GHz Si/SiGe Cascaded Constructive-Wave Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 26dB-gain 100GHz Si/SiGe Cascaded Constructive-Wave Amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4977521/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727883","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977521/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 26dB-gain 100GHz Si/SiGe Cascaded Constructive-Wave Amplifier","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D29_03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047696S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4977522,"authors":[{"name":"Satwik Patnaik","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Satwik","lastName":"Patnaik","id":"37647431700"},{"name":"Narasimha Lanka","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Narasimha","lastName":"Lanka","id":"37660835300"},{"name":"Ramesh Harjani","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Harjani","id":"37275606500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3458-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0193-6530"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8606"}],"articleNumber":"4977522","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":692},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Injection-locked oscillators","Phased arrays","CMOS technology","Radio frequency","Adders","Steady-state","Circuits","Radar applications","Antenna arrays","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","CMOS integrated circuits","injection locked oscillators","phased array radar","radar receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-mode architecture","injection locking","local oscillator","phase-shifting phased-array receiver","phase-generation schemes","CMOS technology","four-channel intermediate-frequency summer","256b serial register","digital programming","injection-locked oscillator","differential inductors","phased-array radar","mixer","phase-generation oscillator","size 0.13 mum","voltage 1.55 V","frequency 2.4 GHz","power 42 mW"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces two new phase-generation schemes, based on injection locking, for local oscillator (LO) phase-shifting phased-array receiver architectures. An integrated four-channel phased-array receiver operating at 2.4 GHz is fabricated in a 0.13 mum CMOS technology. The design consists of a mixer and a phase-generation oscillator for each channel, in addition to a four-channel intermediate-frequency (IF) summer and 256b serial register for digital programming. This unique architecture exploits the steady-state phase at the output of an injection-locked oscillator (ILO) to create the desired phase-shift pattern. The four-channel receiver core draws only 42 mW (10.5 mW/channel) from a 1.55 V power supply and occupies 1.2times1.2 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of active area.

First, the targeted band of 9 GHz (plus margin for process variations) is divided in two parts, each part being covered by a separate oscillator. This relaxes the tunability requirements for each oscillator. To enable direct conversion, the PLL uses quadrature VCOs (QVCOs) having quadrature signals at the output. The outputs of both QVCOs are buffered and multiplexed by a frequency selector. Next, the wideband frequency divider chain is realized with an injection-locked divide-by-4 prescaler, followed by a divide-by-2 prescaler and an integer-N frequency divider. A frequency counter at the output of the divider is read via a shift register and used to calibrate the PLL. A phase-frequency detector (PFD), a charge pump (CP) and a 3rd-order active loop filter complete this 4th-order type-ll PLL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 57-to-66GHz quadrature PLL in 45nm digital CMOS","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977524","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - Digest of Technical Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4926119/4977283/04977524.pdf","startPage":"494","endPage":"495,495a","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2009.4977524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4977283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4977524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4977524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A 57-to-66GHz quadrature PLL in 45nm digital CMOS","conferenceDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4977524/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10727886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 57-to-66GHz quadrature PLL in 45nm digital CMOS","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"D29_06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045493S","chronDate":"8-12 Feb. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4926119","isNumber":"4977283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4926119","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4977283","articleId":"4977524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
