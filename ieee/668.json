It focuses on the optimization problem of how to find routes from the energy sources to charge stations, especially, when some paths are clogged by traffic jam. A bipartite graph model is used to analyze the route problem and two algorithms are presented to compute minimal energy metric route.

Existing DoF-based models differ in their interference cancelation (IC) behavior and suffer from either loss of solution space or possible infeasible solutions. Recently, a DoF model based on a novel node-ordering concept was proposed to overcome the limitations of the exiting DoF models. In this paper, we apply this new DoF model to study a throughput maximization problem in a multi-hop network. The problem formulation jointly considers half duplex, node ordering, DoF consumption constraints and flow routing and is in the form of a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Our main contribution is the development of an efficient polynomial time algorithm that offers a competitive solution to the MILP through a series of linear programs (LPs). The key idea in the algorithm is to explore (i) the impact of node ordering on DoF consumption for IC at a node, and (ii) route diversity in the network while ensuring DoF constraints are satisfied at each node throughout the iterations. Simulation results show that our solutions by the proposed algorithm are competitive and feasible.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2013.88","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679728/6680206/06680221.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2013.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Throughput Maximization for a Multi-hop MIMO Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680221/","displayDocTitle":"On Throughput Maximization for a Multi-hop MIMO Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971835","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680221/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Throughput Maximization for a Multi-hop MIMO Network","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5104a037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087116S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679728","isNumber":"6680206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679728","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6680206","articleId":"6680221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6680226,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Yuan","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37078192600"},{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37276885400"},{"name":"Y.

This paper advocates a new and alternative paradigm called United network of Primary and Secondary networks (UPS). UPS allows a complete cooperation between primary and secondary networks at the node level to relay each other's traffic, in addition to existing dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in time, space, and frequency domains. Such cooperation allows the primary and secondary networks to access a much richer network resources from the combined network. As a case study, we consider a problem with the goal of supporting the rate requirement of the primary network traffic while maximizing the minimum throughput of the secondary sessions. For this problem, we develop an optimization model and formulate a combinatorial optimization problem.

However, in underwater cooperative acoustic networks, long propagation delays and complex acoustic channels make the conventional relay selection schemes designed for terrestrial wireless networks inefficient. In this paper, we develop a new best relay selection criterion, called COoperative Best Relay Assessment (COBRA), for underwater cooperative acoustic networks to minimize the one-way packet transmission time. The new criterion takes into account both the spectral efficiency and the underwater long propagation delay to improve the overall throughput performance of the network with energy constraint. A best relay selection algorithm is also proposed based on COBRA criterion. This algorithm only requires the channel statistical information instead of the instantaneous channel state. Our simulation results show a significant decrease on one-way packet transmission time with COBRA. The throughput and delivery ratio performance improvement further verifies the advantages of our proposed criterion over the conventional channel state based algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2013.36","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679728/6680206/06680229.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2013.36","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Effective Relay Selection for Underwater Cooperative Acoustic Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680229/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971795","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680229/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Relay Selection for Underwater Cooperative Acoustic Networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5104a104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069521S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679728","isNumber":"6680206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679728","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6680206","articleId":"6680229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6680237,"authors":[{"name":"Shouling Ji","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Shouling","lastName":"Ji","id":"37399190500"},{"name":"Mingyuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"38235766100"},{"name":"Raheem Beyah","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Raheem","lastName":"Beyah","id":"37281712100"},{"name":"Zhipeng Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Cai","id":"38236646400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3408-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"6680237","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Routing protocols","Real-time systems","Power control","Cognitive radio","Data communication","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","power control","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","cognitive radio networks","spectrum aware semistructure routing framework","power control","forwarding zones","routing zones","local real time spectrum dynamics","global routing performance","routing protocol"]}],"abstract":"Routing is one of the most important and fundamental issues in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs).

By employing forwarding zones and routing zones, SSR can effectively utilize the local real-time spectrum dynamics and meanwhile guarantee the global routing performance. Second, considering the lack of analytical models for routing protocol performance [1] in CRNs, we analyze the upper bound of the induced latency and scalability of SSR.

Existing work lacks an in-depth investigation on the sensing quality of such sensing systems, which faces two basic problems: 1) how to measure the sensing quality? and 2) how many humans or vehicles are necessary to satisfy the sensing quality requirement of the whole urban area? To solve the first problem, we propose a metric called Inter-Cover Time (ICT) to characterize the opportunity with which a sub region is covered, which reflects the sensing quality directly. According to the empirical measurement studies on real mobility traces of thousands of taxis collected in Beijing and Shanghai, we find that the aggregated ICT Distribution (ICTD) closely resembles a truncated power-law distribution regardless of the size of sub regions and the number of vehicles. We also analyze the reasons behind this particular pattern by the evaluation on four known mobility models. To solve the second problem, we further propose a metric called opportunistic coverage ratio based on the ICTD to characterize the relationship between the sensing quality of an urban area and vehicle number. Our results provide fundamental guidelines on the measurement of sensing quality and network planning for opportunistic urban sensing applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679728/6680206/06680245.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2013.66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2013.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680206","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Opportunistic Coverage for Urban Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Sensors","Global Positioning System","Urban areas","Wireless sensor networks","Exponential distribution","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic sensing","vehicle-mounted sensor","human-carried sensor","sensing quality","intercover time","Beijing","Shanghai","ICT distribution","power-law distribution","mobility model","opportunistic coverage ratio","ICTD","network planning","urban sensing application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor networks","coverage","opportunistic sensing","urban sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On Opportunistic Coverage for Urban Sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680245/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971762","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Opportunistic Coverage for Urban Sensing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5104a231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096031S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679728","isNumber":"6680206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679728","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6680206","articleId":"6680245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6680291,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Dai","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Dai","id":"37856708200"},{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279156600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3408-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"6680291","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Delays","Directional antennas","Availability","Interference","Routing","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","directive antennas","radio networks","routing protocols","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional antenna","cognitive radio network","primary user","PU","CRN","dynamic channel availability","wireless network","optimal routing selection phase","source routing protocol","USRP-Gnuradio","reliability","piggyback information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","directional antennas","USRP/Gnuradio","boundary nodes","routing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680291","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2013.65","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","abstract":"The unpredictable activities of primary users (PUs) make the channel availabilities in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) very unstable. The dynamic channel availabilities cause routing in CRNs to be more difficult than in traditional wireless networks. Specifically, when a source node needs to select a route to reach the destination, the \"optimal\" route during the route selection phase may not be reliable because of the sudden appearance of a PU, and thus, may not be optimal during the data transmission phase. In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol based on the source routing in traditional wireless networks. We consider the angle dimension of CRNs by assuming that the directional antennas are equipped on every node. The directional antennas can facilitate the marking of boundary areas of primary users. We use the USRP/Gnu radio to show the sensing result differences of different directions at the boundary area of a primary user. For every optional route between a source node and a destination node, we can evaluate its reliability and other performance by evaluating the PU areas it passes through, and estimating the possible transmission rate of each link on this route. Based on these parameters, we propose an algorithm for route selection, considering both the reliability and delay. Our routing protocol only requires very limited piggyback information, compared to other routing protocols in CRNs. It is efficient and highly adaptable under the dynamic channel availabilities. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2013.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680206","startPage":"502","endPage":"510","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679728/6680206/06680291.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boundary Helps: Efficient Routing Protocol Using Directional Antennas in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680291/","displayDocTitle":"Boundary Helps: Efficient Routing Protocol Using Directional Antennas in Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971808","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boundary Helps: Efficient Routing Protocol Using Directional Antennas in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5104a502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145618S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679728","isNumber":"6680206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679728","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6680206","articleId":"6680291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6680297,"authors":[{"name":"Jilong Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN"],"firstName":"Jilong","lastName":"Liao","id":"37085426018"},{"name":"Kefa Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN"],"firstName":"Kefa","lastName":"Lu","id":"38244078100"},{"name":"Qing Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Cao","id":"37287680700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3408-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"6680297","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Cloud computing","Servers","Algorithm design and analysis","Synchronization","Data privacy","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","meta data","middleware","resource allocation","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-aware distributed storage","heterogeneous cloud computing platform","middleware replication","cloud vendor server","physical data storage","metadata","fine-grained file replication algorithm","data access pattern","device state pattern","quantitative analysis","Rice University","load balancing","load storage diversification","Uno system","mobile device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smartphone","cloud","privacy"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is an emerging research area that has drawn considerable interest in recent years. However, the current infrastructure raises significant concerns about how to protect users' privacy, in part due to that users are storing their data in the cloud vendors' servers. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing and implementing a novel middleware, called Uno, which separates the storage of physical data and their associated metadata. In our design, users' physical data are stored locally on those devices under a user's full control, while their metadata can be uploaded to the commercial cloud. To ensure the reliability of users' data, we develop a novel fine-grained file replication algorithm that exploits both data access patterns and device state patterns. Based on a quantitative analysis of the data set from Rice University [1], this algorithm replicates data intelligently in different time slots, so that it can not only significantly improve data availability, but also achieve a satisfactory performance on load balancing and storage diversification. We implement the Uno system on a heterogeneous testbed composed of both host servers and mobile devices, and demonstrate the programmability of Uno through implementation and evaluation of two sample applications, Uno@Home and Uno@Sense.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2013.39","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679728/6680206/06680297.pdf","startPage":"551","endPage":"559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2013.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uno: A Privacy-Aware Distributed Storage and Replication Middleware for Heterogeneous Computing Platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680297/","displayDocTitle":"Uno: A Privacy-Aware Distributed Storage and Replication Middleware for Heterogeneous Computing Platforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971827","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680297/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uno: A Privacy-Aware Distributed Storage and Replication Middleware for Heterogeneous Computing Platforms","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"5104a551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083005S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679728","isNumber":"6680206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679728","xplore-issue":"6680206","articleId":"6680297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6680303,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Li","affiliation":["Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab. for Signal Processing, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.R.

In this paper we focus on the application of direction of arrival (DoA) and proposed a compressive sensing based direct DoA estimation framework (CS-DDoA) for wireless sensor array network. Unlike the former signal reconstruction-processing scheme, CS-DDoA utilize the spatial and spectral sparsity of target, then reformulates them into a global problems.

Under this framework, array data transmission volume can be greatly reduce without distinct performance decline, which has great potential for wireless sensor array network with limited resources.

Therefore, it is very important to detect falls of an elderly in a timely and accurate manner, so that immediate response and proper care can be rendered. Radar is an effective non-intrusive sensing modality which is well suited for this purpose. It can detect human motions in all types of environments, penetrate walls and fabrics, preserve privacy, and is insensitive to lighting conditions. In this paper, we use micro-Doppler features in radar signal corresponding to human body motions and gait to detect falls using a narrowband pulse-Doppler radar. Human motions cause time-varying Doppler signatures, which are analyzed using time-frequency representations and matching pursuit decomposition for feature extraction and fall detection. The extracted features include the principal components of the time-frequency signal representations. To analyze the sequential characteristics of typical falls, we use the extracted signal features for training and testing hidden Markov models and support vector machines indifferent falling scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm and method achieve fast and accurate fall detections.","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2013.27","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679591/6680445/06680475.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2013.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680445","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fall Detection Based on Sequential Modeling of Radar Signal Time-Frequency Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fall Detection Based on Sequential Modeling of Radar Signal Time-Frequency Features","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680475/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971656","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680475/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fall Detection Based on Sequential Modeling of Radar Signal Time-Frequency Features","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5089a169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070089S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679591","isNumber":"6680445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679591","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6680445","articleId":"6680475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6680531,"authors":[{"name":"George Mathew","affiliation":["Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics, Temple University Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Mathew","id":"37537512100"},{"name":"Zoran Obradovic","affiliation":["Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics, Temple University Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Zoran","lastName":"Obradovic","id":"37296628500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5089-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6680531","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart phones","Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Servers","Batteries","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cloud computing","cost reduction","data acquisition","health care","information retrieval","Linux","medical information systems","mobile computing","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational efficiency","personalized medical application","mobile cloud computing environment","mobile computing device","network connectivity","personalized service delivery","business domain","healthcare","wellness mobile application","data requirement","computational requirement","on-demand provisioning capability","elasticity","ecosystem","pervasive health information access","promotion algorithm","data process","communication cost reduction","mobile endpoint","cloud-based long term data service","Android smartphone","data acquisition","Linux server","private cloud","4G network","health service","data communication time reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["medical informatics","mobile cloud computing","personalized wellness"]}],"abstract":"Mobile computing and cloud services are two technologies that have gained momentum in recent times. The proliferation of mobile computing devices and network connectivity has made it an attractive platform for delivering personalized services in many business domains including healthcare. Personalized health and wellness mobile applications have computational and data requirements that are necessitated by the localized processing needs of the application. The on-demand provisioning capability and elasticity of cloud services combined with the local processing capability of mobile devices can provide an ecosystem for pervasive access to health information. In this study we explore some of the specifics of these health and wellness applications. We introduce promotion algorithm as a mechanism to efficiently process data points locally by mobile devices. This algorithm can take advantage of the local processing power of smart phones and help reduce communication costs between mobile endpoint and cloud-based long-term data services. Experiments were performed using an Android smart phone for real time data acquisition of more than 10 million data points and a Linux server in a private cloud over 4G network simulating a health service. Results showed that the proposed algorithm could help preserve battery life by a factor of 10 and reduce data communication time by a factor of 20 as a result of utilizing local computation on a mobile device.","doi":"10.1109/ICHI.2013.83","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679591/6680445/06680531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI.2013.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680445","startPage":"535","endPage":"540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Computational Efficiency for Personalized Medical Applications in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Computational Efficiency for Personalized Medical Applications in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680531/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971634","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680531/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Computational Efficiency for Personalized Medical Applications in Mobile Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5089a535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095334S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679591","isNumber":"6680445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679591","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6680445","articleId":"6680531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6680554,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Ali-Ahmad","affiliation":["Orange SA, Paris, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Ali-Ahmad"},{"name":"Claudio Cicconetti","affiliation":["Intecs, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cicconetti"},{"name":"Antonio de la Oliva","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"de la Oliva"},{"name":"Martin Dr\u00e4xler","affiliation":["Universitat Paderborn, Paderborn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Dr\u00e4xler"},{"name":"Rohit Gupta","affiliation":["Signalion, Germany"],"firstName":"Rohit","lastName":"Gupta"},{"name":"Vincenzo Mancuso","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Mancuso"},{"name":"Laurent Roullet","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs., France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Roullet"},{"name":"Vincenzo Sciancalepore","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Sciancalepore"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2433-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-0350"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-0369"}],"articleNumber":"6680554","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1520},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Computer architecture","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","radio access networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CROWD","SDN approach","DenseNets","traffic demand","total traffic volume","current limitation","heterogeneous wireless networks","very-dense wireless networks","traffic forecasts","radio access network","RAN","control overhead","mobility management","network collapse","network operational cost","energy consumption","maintenance-optimisation","software defined network","mobile networks","LTE cells","WLAN cells","core network","reconfigurable backhaul"]}],"abstract":"Traffic demands in mobile networks are expected to grow substantially in the next years, both in terms of total traffic volume and of bit-rate required by individual users. It is generally agreed that the only possible solution to overcome the current limitations is to deploy very dense and heterogeneous wireless networks, which we call DenseNets. However, simply scaling down existing networks by orders of magnitude, as required to fulfill traffic forecasts, is not possible because of the following constraints: i) the bottleneck would shift from the Radio Access Network (RAN) to the backhaul, ii) control overhead, especially related to mobility management, would make the network collapse, iii) operational costs of the network would be unbearable due to energy consumption and maintenance/optimisation. In this paper, Software Defined Network (SDN) for mobile networks is claimed as the paradigm shift necessary to tackle adequately the above challenges. A novel architecture is proposed, which supports DenseNets made of overlapping LTE and WLAN cells connected to the core network via a reconfigurable backhaul.","doi":"10.1109/EWSDN.2013.11","publicationTitle":"2013 Second European Workshop on Software Defined Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Second European Workshop on Software Defined Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679578/6680541/06680554.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWSDN.2013.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CROWD: An SDN Approach for DenseNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680554/","displayDocTitle":"CROWD: An SDN Approach for DenseNets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971191","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680554/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CROWD: An SDN Approach for DenseNets","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"2433a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067946S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679578","isNumber":"6680541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679578","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6680541","articleId":"6680554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6680564,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Jarschel","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Jarschel","id":"37888234500"},{"name":"Florian Wamser","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Wamser","id":"37856019100"},{"name":"Thomas Hohn","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Hohn","id":"37085990092"},{"name":"Thomas Zinner","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zinner","id":"37545394200"},{"name":"Phuoc Tran-Gia","affiliation":["University of W\u00fcrzburg, Institute of Computer Science, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Phuoc","lastName":"Tran-Gia","id":"38272340900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2433-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-0350"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-0369"}],"articleNumber":"6680564","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2894},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["YouTube","Streaming media","Bandwidth","Quality of service","Inspection","Control systems","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inspection","quality of experience","social networking (online)","subscriber loops","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN-based application-aware networking","YouTube video streaming","flow-based traffic management","deep packet inspection","direct information input","OpenFlow testbed","application information","quality of experience","QoE","software-defined networking","access networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Application-Aware Networking","SDN","Software Defined Networking","OpenFlow","DPI","Deep Packet Inspection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680564","doi":"10.1109/EWSDN.2013.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWSDN.2013.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680541","publicationTitle":"2013 Second European Workshop on Software Defined Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Second European Workshop on Software Defined Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679578/6680541/06680564.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDN-Based Application-Aware Networking on the Example of YouTube Video Streaming","abstract":"Application-Aware Networking is a promising approach to provide good application quality to users in scenarios with limited network resources, like today's access networks.

Drastic increases however, come along with new challenges, namely the increase of switching losses in all components. The application of power circuits used in radio frequency transmission equipment helps to overcome those. However, those circuits were not designed to meet the same requirements as power converters. This paper summarizes the contributions in the recent years in the application of very high frequency (VHF) technologies in power electronics, which show the results of the recent advances and describes the remaining challenges. The presented results include a self-oscillating gate drive, air-core inductor optimizations, an offline LED driver with a power density of 8.9 W/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n, and a 120-MHz, 9-W dc powered LED driver with 89% efficiency as well as a bidirectional VHF converter. The challenges to be solved before VHF converters can be used effectively in industrial products are within those three categories: 1) components; 2) circuit architectures; and 3) reliability testing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2294798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868320","startPage":"386","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6868320/06680598.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of Very High Frequency Power Supplies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680598/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolution of Very High Frequency Power Supplies","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14485745","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of Very High Frequency Power Supplies","sourcePdf":"jestpe-knott-2294798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198568S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6868320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6868320","articleId":"6680598","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6680600,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Tappertzhofen","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Institute of Materials in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology II, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Tappertzhofen","id":"37073353300"},{"name":"Eike Linn","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Institute of Materials in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology II, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Eike","lastName":"Linn","id":"37991538000"},{"name":"Ulrich B\u00f6ttger","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Institute of Materials in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology II, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"B\u00f6ttger","id":"37314979000"},{"name":"Rainer Waser","affiliation":["RWTH Aachen University, Institute of Materials in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology II, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Waser","id":"37315250300"},{"name":"Ilia Valov","affiliation":["J\u00fclich Research Center, Fundamentals for Future Information Technology, J\u00fclich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilia","lastName":"Valov","id":"37073216800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6680600","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1356},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680600","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Nanoscale devices","Resistance","Materials","Voltage measurement","Electronic countermeasures","Memristors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive random access memory","RRAM","nanobattery effect","device stability","device endurance","electromotive force voltage","high resistive states","memristive device model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resistive switching","nanobattery","non-equilibrium states","retention","endurance"]}],"abstract":"The impact of the recently discovered nanobattery effect on the switching, the endurance, and the retention of resistive random access memory devices is demonstrated.

Within the silicon photonics platform, silicon microring resonators have received a great deal of attention for their ability to implement the critical functionalities of an on-chip optical network while offering superior energy-efficiency and small footprint characteristics. However, silicon microring-based structures have a large susceptibility to fabrication errors and changes in temperature. Integrated heaters that provide local heating of individual microrings offer a method to correct for these effects, but no large-scale solution has been achieved to automate their tuning process. In this context, we present the use of dithering signals as a broad method for automatic wavelength tuning and thermal stabilization of microring resonators. We show that this technique can be manifested in low-speed analog and digital circuitry, lending credence to its ability to be scaled to a complete photonic interconnection network.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2294564","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6687255/06680601.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2294564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelength Locking and Thermally Stabilizing Microring Resonators Using Dithering Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680601/","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength Locking and Thermally Stabilizing Microring Resonators Using Dithering Signals","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2014","accessionNumber":"13996517","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680601/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength Locking and Thermally Stabilizing Microring Resonators Using Dithering Signals","sourcePdf":"jlt-padmaraju-2294564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098379S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6687255","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6687255","articleId":"6680601","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680604,"authors":[{"name":"Manu Airaksinen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/6722963/6680604/6680604-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manu Airaksinen was born in Kuopio, Finland, in 1986.

The proposed quasi closed phase (QCP) analysis method utilizes weighted linear prediction (WLP) with a specific attenuated main excitation (AME) weight function that attenuates the contribution of the glottal source in the linear prediction model optimization. This enables the use of the autocorrelation criterion in linear prediction in contrast to the covariance criterion used in conventional closed phase analysis. The QCP method was compared to previously developed methods by using synthetic vowels produced with the conventional source-filter model as well as with a physical modeling approach. The obtained objective measures show that the QCP method improves the GIF performance in terms of errors in typical glottal source parametrizations for both low- and high-pitched vowels. Additionally, QCP was tested in a physiologically oriented vocoder, where the analysis/synthesis quality was evaluated with a subjective listening test indicating improved perceived quality for normal speaking style.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2013.2294585","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2013.2294585","startPage":"596","endPage":"607","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6722963/06680604.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680604/","displayDocTitle":"Quasi Closed Phase Glottal Inverse Filtering Analysis With Weighted Linear Prediction","volume":"22","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14056187","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6680604/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi Closed Phase Glottal Inverse Filtering Analysis With Weighted Linear Prediction","sourcePdf":"taslp-airaksinen-2294585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106017S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6722963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6722963","articleId":"6680604","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6680620,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6750022/6680620/6680620-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ke Guan (s'10\u2013M'13) received the B.E. degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2006.","Currently, he is working towards the Ph.D. degree in the State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety & School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University.

They can bring about severe extra propagation loss, and therefore, lead to poor coverage or handover failure. However, their influence has been rarely investigated before. Based on rich experimental results of 930 MHz measurements conducted on train stations of high-speed railway in China, this paper proposes two empirical models for the extra propagation loss owing to train stations for the first time. The extra loss depends on four conditions: the distance between the transmitter (Tx) and the train station, the type of the train station, the track carrying the train, and the propagation mechanism zones. Hence, the models are established for every case of all the combinations of these four conditions. The validation shows that the proposed models accurately predict the extra propagation loss and support an effective way to involve the influence of the train station in the simulation and design of the signaling and train control communications systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6750022/06680620.pdf","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2294468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2294468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680620","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical Models for Extra Propagation Loss of Train Stations on High-Speed Railway","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rail transportation","Propagation losses","Loss measurement","Fading","Planning","Transmitting antennas","Rails"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiowave propagation","railway communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["train control communications systems","electromagnetic wave propagation","high speed railway","train stations","extra propagation loss","frequency 930 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-speed railway","propagation modeling","railway communications","train station"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Models for Extra Propagation Loss of Train Stations on High-Speed Railway","volume":"62","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6680620/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14143570","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Models for Extra Propagation Loss of Train Stations on High-Speed Railway","sourcePdf":"tap-ai-2294468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107116S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6750022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6750022","articleId":"6680620","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680625,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hu Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronic Technology, National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37290804800"},{"name":"Albert Chin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Chin","id":"37275447600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6680625","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2715},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680625","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Logic gates","MOSFET circuits","Capacitors","MOSFET","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","DRAM chips","ferroelectric capacitors","ferroelectric materials","ferroelectric storage","leakage currents","MOSFET","zirconium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-leakage-current DRAM-like memory","one-transistor ferroelectric MOSFET","Hf-based gate dielectric","power consumption","capacitor leakage current","capacitor aspect ratio","dielectric constant material","dynamic random access memory","1T FeMOS device","on-off retention window","low OFF-state leakage","ferroelectric gate dielectric","p-MOSFET","high-\u03ba CMOS processing","time 5 ns","temperature 85 degC","ZrHfO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ferroelectric","ZrHfO","1T","DRAM","FeMOS","MOSFET","memory"]}],"abstract":"The power consumption of capacitor leakage current, increase of the capacitor aspect ratio, and lack of higher dielectric constant (\u03ba) material are the difficult challenges to downscaling dynamic random access memory (DRAM).

In particular, we utilize a hypothesis test to detect the outlier. Meanwhile, a PR process is applied to form a DOA estimator bank and a corresponding root estimator bank. We propose a distance detection strategy which exploits the information contained in the estimated root estimator to help determine the final DOA estimates when all the DOA estimators fail to pass the reliability test. Furthermore, the proposed method is realized in terms of real-valued computations, leading to an efficient implementation.

Moreover, results from a noise stress test with additive Gaussian noise and respiratory noises justify the noise robustness of the HSS-EEMD/K. When compared with four other efficient methods that mainly employ wavelet transform, energy, simplicity, and frequency measures, respectively, using the same experimental database, the HSS-EEMD/K scheme exhibits increased accuracy and prediction power over all others at the level of 7-19% and 4-9%, respectively, both in controls and pathological cases.

Preliminary results show up to ~15 X improvement in sensitivity per bias current for a resonator operated as a Lorentz force magnetometer. Magnetometer sensitivity figure-of-merit, defined as sensitivity (mV/T) over sensor dc bias current, has increased from 0.29 \u03a9/T(mV/Tesla/mA) to 4.22 \u03a9/T via internal thermal-piezoresistive amplification that also led to resonator effective quality factor (Q) increasing from its intrinsic value of 1140 to 16900 (in air). Previous work on the thermal-piezoresistive amplification effect suggests that amplification factors up to 3-4 orders of magnitude can be achieved using optimally designed structures, which can lead to ultra-high sensitivities for the presented sensors. It should be noted that the main focus of this letter is not to demonstrate a highly sensitive magnetometer, but rather to demonstrate the ability to improve magnetometer sensitivity as the resonator internal Q-amplification kicks-in. Although the resonant structure in this letter has not been optimized to operate as a magnetometer, sensitivities as high as 262 mV/T in air (minimum detectable field in the \u03bcT range) have been achieved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6720122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2013.2293349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/6720122/06680651.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"270","doi":"10.1109/LED.2013.2293349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Enhancement of Lorentz Force MEMS Resonant Magnetometers via Internal Thermal-Piezoresistive Amplification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Enhancement of Lorentz Force MEMS Resonant Magnetometers via Internal Thermal-Piezoresistive Amplification","volume":"35","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6680651/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14056138","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680651/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Enhancement of Lorentz Force MEMS Resonant Magnetometers via Internal Thermal-Piezoresistive Amplification","sourcePdf":"led-mehdizadeh-2293349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034228S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6720122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6720122","articleId":"6680651","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6680657,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyu Peng","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Laboratory of Applied Research on Electromagnetics (ARE), Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086627259"},{"name":"Tiancun Hu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Space Microwave Laboratory, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tiancun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37978774600"},{"name":"Wangzhao Cui","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Space Microwave Laboratory, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wangzhao","lastName":"Cui","id":"37285575400"},{"name":"Jiangtao Huangfu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Laboratory of Applied Research on Electromagnetics (ARE), Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Huangfu","id":"37268309900"},{"name":"Changzhi Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Changzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086015936"},{"name":"Lixin Ran","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Laboratory of Applied Research on Electromagnetics (ARE), Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Ran","id":"37272889200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6680657","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Phased arrays","Interference","Array signal processing","Antenna radiation patterns","Optimization","Global Positioning System"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","Gaussian noise","interference (signal)","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconventional beamforming approach","quasihemispheric coverage","phased array antenna","wide-angle coverage beam synthesis","antenna radiation pattern","nulling algorithm","hypothetical interference incidence","Gaussian white noise","five-element linear array antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","nulling","phased array antenna","stochastic optimization","wide-angle coverage"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unconventional Beamforming for Quasi-Hemispheric Coverage of a Phased Array Antenna","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2013.2294690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6478802","endPage":"1657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6478802/06680657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2294690","startPage":"1654","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680657","abstract":"It is usually difficult to synthesize a wide-angle coverage beam for an array antenna.

Current practice relies on slow laboratory testing of blood cultures for diagnosis. A valuable research question is whether sepsis can be reliably detected before the blood sample is taken. This paper investigates the extent to which physiological events observed in the patient's monitoring traces could be used for the early detection of neonatal sepsis. We model the distribution of these events with an autoregressive hidden Markov model (AR-HMM). Both learning and inference carefully use domain knowledge to extract the baby's true physiology from the monitoring data. Our model can produce real-time predictions about the onset of the infection and also handles missing data. We evaluate the effectiveness of the AR-HMM for sepsis detection on a dataset collected from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2013.2294692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6889048/06680664.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2013.2294692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6889048","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models for the Early Detection of Neonatal Sepsis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models for the Early Detection of Neonatal Sepsis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564336","pubMedId":"25192568","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6680664/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autoregressive Hidden Markov Models for the Early Detection of Neonatal Sepsis","sourcePdf":"jbhi-stanculescu-2294692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076149S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6889048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6889048","articleId":"6680664","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680672,"authors":[{"name":"Haodong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Changshu Institute of Technology, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/6740871/6680672/6680672-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haodong Yang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the College of Automation of the Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2011.","He is currently a Lecturer in the Electrical Engineering Department, Changshu Institute of Technology, Suzhou, China.

A strong electromagnetic force exists between the rotor magnets and the stator core in a PMSM. The force directly causes mechanical deformation and vibration of the stator. In small PM motors, mechanical vibration comes mainly from the electromagnetic force of the stator. This paper gives the general expression of the frequency and corresponding mode number of radial force harmonics for a PMSM with a three-phase symmetrical double-layer winding. The paper shows that the lowest mode number of radial force harmonics is the greatest common divisor of pole number and slot number. The force harmonics with a low mode number can induce a high mechanical vibration, especially for PMSMs with a fractional slot combination. This is simulated using a weak-coupling electromagnetic-mechanical finite element model. To illustrate the influence of radial force harmonics with a low mode number on vibration, a method to eliminate the lowest mode number force harmonics for the fractional slot combination motor is proposed. A test rig for the 12-slot 8-pole prototype motor is set up. The experimental and simulated results confirm that force harmonics with low mode number have a major impact on vibration.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2013.2290304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/6740871/06680672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2013.2290304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740871","startPage":"38","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Radial Force Harmonics With Low Mode Number on Electromagnetic Vibration of PMSM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Radial Force Harmonics With Low Mode Number on Electromagnetic Vibration of PMSM","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111793","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6680672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Radial Force Harmonics With Low Mode Number on Electromagnetic Vibration of PMSM","sourcePdf":"tec-chen-2290304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089793S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6740871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6740871","articleId":"6680672","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680676,"authors":[{"name":"Piero Triverio","affiliation":["Edward S.

Theoretical equations are defined and solved whereby the contours can be drawn in real time in a computer-added design environment. A key and novel result from this theory is the definition of a 2-D harmonic design space that opens up rapidly as small concessions from optimum power and efficiency matching conditions are made. A design example is described and fabricated, which demonstrates the utility of using the second harmonic clipping contour during the PA design process. A 10-W GaN demonstrator gives measured continuous wave power > 8.5 W, efficiency > 60%, and better than -30-dB adjacent channel power ratio over a bandwidth of 1-2.9 GHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6701340/06680692.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2292675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2292675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Mode Power Amplifier Design Using Harmonic Clipping Contours: Theory and Practice","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Impedance","Linearity","Equations","Power harmonic filters","Bandwidth","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","limiters","power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second harmonic clipping contour","2D harmonic design","computer-added design environment","harmonic impedance condition","zero-grazing","Smith chart","continuous class-B-J voltage waveform formulation","PA","graphical power amplifier design tool","continuous mode power ampliiier design","power 10 W","bandwidth 1 GHz to 2.9 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class B/J","clipping contour","continuous modes","power amplifier (PA)","waveform engineering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Mode Power Amplifier Design Using Harmonic Clipping Contours: Theory and Practice","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6680692/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998045","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Mode Power Amplifier Design Using Harmonic Clipping Contours: Theory and Practice","sourcePdf":"tmtt-canning-2292675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6701340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6701340","articleId":"6680692","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680698,"authors":[{"name":"Lihua Pang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6851966/6680698/pang-2294650-small.gif","p":["\nLihua Pang received the B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Xidian\nUniversity, Xi'an, China, in 2006, 2009, and 2013, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","She is currently a Lecturer with the School of Communication and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Science\nand Technology, Xi'an.

At the same time, a drastic reduction of the LDO output capacitance enables ultra-low-power consumption during sleep and energy efficient wake-up, resulting in system energy savings up to a factor of 4.6.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2290083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2290083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6932540/06680706.pdf","startPage":"2287","endPage":"2296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural and Circuit Design Techniques for Power Management of Ultra-Low-Power MCU Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Architectural and Circuit Design Techniques for Power Management of Ultra-Low-Power MCU Systems","volume":"22","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680706/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14686986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural and Circuit Design Techniques for Power Management of Ultra-Low-Power MCU Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lueders-2290083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075732S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6932540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6932540","articleId":"6680706","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6680710,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Chang Zhong","affiliation":["Deparment of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6824280/6680710/6680710-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing-Chang Zhong (M\u201903\u2013SM\u201904) received the Ph.D. degree in control and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and power engineering (awarded the Best Doctoral Thesis Prize) from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2004.","He is currently the Chair Professor in Control and Systems Engineering with the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K. He is a Distinguished Lecturer of IEEE Power Electronics Society and is invited to represent the U.K. at the European Control Association.

In this paper, a control strategy is proposed to make the output impedance of an inverter capacitive at low frequencies (such inverters are called C-inverters). The proposed control strategy involves the feedback of the inductor current through an integrator, which is actually the impedance of a virtual capacitor. The gain of the integrator or the virtual capacitance is first selected to guarantee the stability of the current feedback loop and then optimized to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output voltage. Moreover, some guidelines are developed to facilitate the selection of the filter components for C-inverters. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and excellent performance of C-inverters, with the filter parameters of the test rig selected according to the guidelines developed. It is shown that, with the same hardware, the lowest voltage THD is obtained when the inverter is designed to be a C-inverter. A by product of this study is that, as long as the current ripples are kept within the desired range, the filter inductor should be chosen as small as possible in order to reduce voltage harmonics. This helps reduce the size, weight, and volume of the inductor and improve the power density of the inverter.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2294425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6824280/06680710.pdf","startPage":"5568","endPage":"5578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2294425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Inverters Via a Virtual Capacitor to Achieve Capacitive Output Impedance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680710/","displayDocTitle":"Control of Inverters Via a Virtual Capacitor to Achieve Capacitive Output Impedance","volume":"29","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14349404","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680710/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Inverters Via a Virtual Capacitor to Achieve Capacitive Output Impedance","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhong-2294425-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0837S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6824280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6824280","articleId":"6680710","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680713,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Chin Chen","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6701340/6680713/6680713-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsiao-Chin Chen (M'07) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, on October 6, 1976.

To satisfy the finite communication bandwidth, only partial components of each local vector estimate are allowed to be transmitted to the fusion center (FC) at a particular time, while each sensor intermittently sends information to the FC for reducing energy consumptions. At the FC end, a novel compensation strategy is proposed to compensate the untransmitted components of each local estimates, then a recursively distributed fusion Kalman filter (DFKF) is derived in the linear minimum variance sense. Notice that the designed DFKF update does not need to know the transmitting situation of each component at a particular time, which means that the proposed fusion estimation algorithm is easily implemented for the addressed NMFSs. Since the performance of the designed DFKF is dependent on the selecting probability of each component, some criteria for the choice of probabilities are derived such that the mean squared errors (MSEs) of the designed DFKF are bounded or convergent. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2294603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06680714.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2294603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Finite-Horizon Fusion Kalman Filtering for Bandwidth and Energy Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680714/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Finite-Horizon Fusion Kalman Filtering for Bandwidth and Energy Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14056606","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680714/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Finite-Horizon Fusion Kalman Filtering for Bandwidth and Energy Constrained Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-yu-2294603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091457S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6680714","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-17"},{"_id":6680720,"authors":[{"name":"M\u00e1rio Costa","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University/SMARAD CoE, Otakaari, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6716102/6680720/6680720-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["M\u00e1rio Costa (S'08\u2013M'13) was born in Portugal in 1984.

It is shown that the azimuth-angles of the sources may be estimated from the roots of a complex-valued polynomial or by rooting a real-valued polynomial, instead. The latter method is particularly useful in tracking arbitrarily polarized sources in a sequential snapshot-by-snapshot manner using root-tracking techniques. The proposed polynomial rooting based methods are applicable to polarization sensitive arrays regardless of the array geometry including conformal arrays, and take into account array nonidealities. A large-sample analysis of the polarimetric Capon method is also provided showing that it converges, up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the interference-plus-noise power, to the polarimetric MUSIC method in the high SINR regime. Such a result gives a new insight into the well-known Capon and MUSIC methods. This paper also shows that employing manifold separation in robust Capon beamforming as well as in transmit beamforming schemes leads to improved performance in terms of received SINR when array calibration measurements are used. Extensive numerical results employing real-world polarimetric arrays are given. Results show that employing manifold separation leads to improved performance in many array processing tasks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2294598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06680720.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2294598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"813","endPage":"827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Manifold Separation to Polarimetric Capon Beamformer and Source Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Application of Manifold Separation to Polarimetric Capon Beamformer and Source Tracking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680720/","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6680720/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14056593","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Manifold Separation to Polarimetric Capon Beamformer and Source Tracking","sourcePdf":"tsp-koivunen-2294598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152442S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6680720","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6680721,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Langlois","affiliation":["Civil Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["S\u00e9bastien Langlois received the Ph.D. degree in civil engineering from the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, and the B.Ing. and M.Ing. degrees in civil engineering from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.","Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke.

In part I of this study, nonlinear time history models of two types of transmission-line dampers were developed. In this paper, a model for the complete conductor-damper system is presented. When combined with empirical equations for wind power input and conductor self-damping using the Energy Balance Principle, the direct integration time history model proposed allows the prediction of the vibration amplitudes expected on a damped span. The amplitudes predicted by the model compare well to experimental data sets available in the literature. Since the damper is modelled from its mechanical properties of geometry, mass, stiffness, and damping, the optimization of a conductor-damper system can be done easily with this model, without additional experimental tests. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shock absorbers","Vibrations","Conductors","Numerical models","Resonant frequency","Damping","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conductors (electric)","damping","optimisation","power transmission lines","shock absorbers","vibration control","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aeolian vibration prediction","transmission line conductor","nonlinear time history model","transmission line damper model","complete conductor-damper system","wind power","conductor self-damping","energy balance principle","vibration amplitude prediction","mechanical property","geometry","mass","stiffness","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conductors","dynamics","fatigue","finite-element analysis","transmission lines","vibrations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2291363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6819482/06680721.pdf","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2291363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Aeolian Vibration on Transmission-Line Conductors Using a Nonlinear Time History Model\u2014Part II: Conductor and Damper Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Aeolian Vibration on Transmission-Line Conductors Using a Nonlinear Time History Model\u2014Part II: Conductor and Damper Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680721/","volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680721/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14318909","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Aeolian Vibration on Transmission-Line Conductors Using a Nonlinear Time History Model\u2014Part II: Conductor and Damper Model","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-langlois-2291363-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063438S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6819482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6819482","articleId":"6680721","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":6680722,"authors":[{"name":"Theodoros D.

Grid codes world-wide require that WTs should supply reactive power to the grid during and after the fault, in order to support the grid voltage. The conventional crowbar-based systems that were initially applied in order to protect the rotor-side converter at the occurrence of grid faults, do not fulfill this requirement, as during the connection of the crowbar, the DFIG behaves as a squirrel cage machine, absorbing reactive power from the grid. This drawback led to the design of control systems that eliminate or even avoid the use of the crowbar. In order to conform to the above-mentioned requirement, this paper proposes a coordinated control strategy of the DFIG converters during a grid fault, managing to ride-through the fault without the use of any auxiliary hardware. The coordination of the two controllers is achieved via a fuzzy controller which is properly tuned using genetic algorithms. To validate the proposed control strategy, a case study of a 1.5-MW DFIG supplying a relatively weak electrical system is carried out by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2290622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6799261/06680722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2290622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799261","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Low Voltage Ride-Through Control Strategy for Grid Connected Doubly Fed Induction Wind Generators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Low Voltage Ride-Through Control Strategy for Grid Connected Doubly Fed Induction Wind Generators","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239161","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6680722/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Low Voltage Ride-Through Control Strategy for Grid Connected Doubly Fed Induction Wind Generators","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-vrionis-2290622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068551S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6799261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6799261","articleId":"6680722","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680725,"authors":[{"name":"Arvid Merkert","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems, and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Arvid","lastName":"Merkert","id":"38547184600"},{"name":"Tobias Krone","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems, and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Krone","id":"38547686000"},{"name":"Axel Mertens","affiliation":["Institute for Drive Systems, and Power Electronics, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Mertens","id":"37297781600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6680725","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2894},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"abstract":"Silicon carbide (SiC) based power semiconductors are expected to contribute to an increase in inverter efficiency, switching frequencies, maximum permissible junction temperature, and system power density. This paper presents a comparison of silicon (Si) and SiC device technologies for the use in hybrid electric vehicle traction inverters. SiC-JFETs and SiC-MOSFETs are characterized and a scalable loss and scalable thermal modeling approach is used to find the optimum chip area for each Si or SiC traction inverter. This procedure also provides a proper technical comparison of the semiconductor technologies. The progressed simulations using standardized drive cycles and thermal-electrical coupled semiconductor models permit an inverter performance evaluation close to real load situations, leading to an improved estimation of the benefit which can be expected from systems utilizing SiC technology. This paper concludes that the SiC devices can lead to a reduction in chip area and semiconductor losses by more than 50% at the same time in hard switching applications with partial load dominated

The complex networks under consideration are subject to: 1) the coupling term in a stochastic way is considered; 2) uncertainties exist in the node's dynamics; and 3) pinning distributed synchronization is also considered. By resorting to Lyapunov function methods and stochastic analysis techniques, the tasks to get the distributed robust synchronization and distributed robust pinning synchronization of dynamical networks are solved in terms of a set of inequalities, respectively. The impacts of degree information, stochastic coupling, and uncertainties on synchronization performance, i.e., mean control gain and convergence rate, are derived theoretically. The potential conservativeness for the distributed robust pinning synchronization problem is solved by means of an evolutionary algorithm-based optimization method, which includes a constraint optimization evolutionary algorithm and a convex optimization method and aims at improving the traditional optimization methods. Simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the obtained results.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2285699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6805240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2285699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6805240/06680733.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Robust Synchronization of Dynamical Networks With Stochastic Coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Robust Synchronization of Dynamical Networks With Stochastic Coupling","volume":"61","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680733/","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14265375","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680733/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Robust Synchronization of Dynamical Networks With Stochastic Coupling","sourcePdf":"tcsi-tang-2285699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10341S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6805240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6805240","articleId":"6680733","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6680735,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hsiang Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Brain Research Center, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6756986/6680735/6680735-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Hsiang Chuang received the B.S. degree from Taipei Municipal Teachers College, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2004, and the M.S. degree from the National Taichung University, Taichung, Taiwan, in 2009.

Many studies have further established the feasibility of using independent processes to elucidate human cognitive states. However, various technical problems arise in the building of an online brain-computer interface (BCI). These include the lack of an automatic procedure for selecting independent components of interest (ICi) and the potential risk of not obtaining a desired ICi. Therefore, this study proposes an ICi-ensemble method that uses multiple classifiers with ICA processing to improve upon existing algorithms. The mechanisms that are used in this ensemble system include: 1) automatic ICi selection; 2) extraction of features of the resultant ICi; 3) the construction of parallel pipelines for effectively training multiple classifiers; and a 4) simple process that combines the multiple decisions. The proposed ICi-ensemble is demonstrated in a typical BCI application, which is the monitoring of participants' cognitive states in a realistic sustained-attention driving task. The results reveal that the proposed ICi-ensemble outperformed the previous method using a single ICi with ~ 7% (91.6% versus 84.3%) in the cognitive state classification. Additionally, the proposed ICi-ensemble method that characterizes the EEG dynamics of multiple brain areas favors the application of BCI in natural environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2293139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6756986","startPage":"230","endPage":"238","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/6756986/06680735.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent Component Ensemble of EEG for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680735/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Independent Component Ensemble of EEG for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14144601","pubMedId":"24608683","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent Component Ensemble of EEG for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"tnsre-jung-2293139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182912S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6756986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6756986","articleId":"6680735","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6680737,"authors":[{"name":"Worapan Kusakunniran","affiliation":["Mahidol University, Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Nakhonpathom, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6685907/6680737/6680737-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Worapan Kusakunniran (M'10) received the B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from UNSW, in cooperation with the Neville Roach Laboratory, National ICT Australia, Kensington, Australia, in 2013.","He is currently a Lecturer with the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhonpathom, Thailand.

However, view change can cause significant difficulties for gait recognition because it will alter available visual features for matching substantially. Moreover, it is observed that different parts of gait will be affected differently by view change. By exploring relations between two gaits from two different views, it is also observed that a part of gait in one view is more related to a typical part than any other parts of gait in another view. A new method proposed in this paper considers such variance of correlations between gaits across views that is not explicitly analyzed in the other existing methods. In our method, a novel motion co-clustering is carried out to partition the most related parts of gaits from different views into the same group. In this way, relationships between gaits from different views will be more precisely described based on multiple groups of the motion co-clustering instead of a single correlation descriptor. Inside each group, a linear correlation between gait information across views is further maximized through canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Consequently, gait information in one view can be projected onto another view through a linear approximation under the trained CCA subspaces. In the end, a similarity between gaits originally recorded from different views can be measured under the approximately same view. Comprehensive experiments based on widely adopted gait databases have shown that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2294552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"696","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2294552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685907","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6685907/06680737.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Gait recognition","Bipartite graph","Training","Vectors","Australia","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","correlation methods","gait analysis","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait recognition","correlated motion coclustering","correlation variance","correlation descriptor","canonical correlation analysis","CCA","gait information","linear approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gait recognition","human identification","view change","co-clustering","bipartite graph multipartitioning","canonical correlation analysis"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Gait","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photography","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Statistics as Topic","Subtraction Technique","Whole Body Imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing Gaits Across Views Through Correlated Motion Co-Clustering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680737/","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6680737/","accessionNumber":"13996536","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"26270912","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing Gaits Across Views Through Correlated Motion Co-Clustering","sourcePdf":"tip-kusakunniran-2294552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13307S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6685907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6685907","articleId":"6680737","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6680738,"authors":[{"name":"Gurakuq Dajaku","affiliation":["FEAAM GmbH, Neubiberg, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Gurakuq Dajaku was born in Skenderaj, Kosova, in 1974.

The proposed method extends the original DPC operating principle by considering only the closest subset of two-level voltage vectors to the present switching state. The implementation of this principle requires the power derivatives for feedback, which can present numerical problems when applied experimentally, mainly due to high measurement noise sensitivity. Therefore, a derivative estimator is proposed based on the converter-grid model in the synchronous reference frame. In addition, a virtual flux observer is developed to achieve synchronization and improve robustness in the presence of grid voltage harmonics. The proposed method is applicable to any multilevel converter topology of any number of levels.

This paper is to improve the saturation-dependent stability of the power system equipped with the energy storage based damping controller (ESDC), and hence, reduce the required size of the ES. The phenomenon that the capacity of ES is smaller than the required value produced by the ESDC, is modeled as actuator saturation using the saturation function. The proposed method is to design an anti-windup compensator (AWC), which in the event of saturation, produces a signal based on the output difference between the ESDC and saturated ES and then augment the signal to the ESDC to alleviate the adverse effect of saturation. The AWC is designed with the reduced-order model of power system and linear matrix inequality. Detailed design procedure is introduced. Case studies based on a modified 4-machine 2-area power system and 10-machine New England power system are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the AWC design method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2291378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6799261/06680749.pdf","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1185","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2291378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Anti-Windup Compensator for Energy Storage-Based Damping Controller to Enhance Power System Stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Design of Anti-Windup Compensator for Energy Storage-Based Damping Controller to Enhance Power System Stability","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6680749/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239124","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007398","fundingName":"Strategiske Forskningsr\u00e5d"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Anti-Windup Compensator for Energy Storage-Based Damping Controller to Enhance Power System Stability","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wen-2291378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086537S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6799261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6799261","articleId":"6680749","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6680757,"authors":[{"name":"Bhim Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6824280/6680757/6680757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bhim Singh (SM\u201999\u2013F\u201910) received Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical engineering from the University of Roorkee, Roorkee, India, in 1977, the M.Tech. degree in power apparatus and systems, and the Ph.D. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India, in 1979 and 1983, respectively.","In 1983, he joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Roorkee, as a Lecturer.

The proposed system is dual purpose, as it not only feeds extracted solar energy into the grid but it also helps in improving power quality in the distribution system. The presented system serves the purpose of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), feeding SPV energy to the grid, harmonics mitigation of loads connected at point of common coupling (PCC) and balancing the grid currents. The SPV system uses a three-phase voltage source converter (VSC) for performing all these functions. An improved linear sinusoidal tracer (ILST)-based control algorithm is proposed for control of VSC. In the proposed system, a variable dc link voltage is used for MPPT. An instantaneous compensation technique is used incorporating changes in PV power for fast dynamic response. The SPV system is first simulated in MATLAB along with Simulink and sim-power system toolboxes, and simulated results are verified experimentally. The proposed SPV system and its control algorithm are implemented in a three-phase distribution system for power quality improvement and improved utilization of VSC. The total harmonics distortions (THDs) of grid currents and PCC voltages are observed within IEEE-929 and IEEE-519 standards.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2293656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6824280/06680757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2293656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824280","startPage":"5347","endPage":"5357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ILST Control Algorithm of Single-Stage Dual Purpose Grid Connected Solar PV System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ILST Control Algorithm of Single-Stage Dual Purpose Grid Connected Solar PV System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14349398","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6680757/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ILST Control Algorithm of Single-Stage Dual Purpose Grid Connected Solar PV System","sourcePdf":"tpel-jain-2293656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050991S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6824280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6824280","articleId":"6680757","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680758,"authors":[{"name":"Minki Ahn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minki","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37085438578"},{"name":"Changick Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Changick","lastName":"Song","id":"37406218100"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6680758","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Covariance matrices","Relays","Joints","Vectors","Correlation","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","combined source-channel coding","diversity reception","MIMO communication","precoding","relay networks (telecommunication)","singular value decomposition","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity analysis","coded spatial multiplexing","MIMO AF relaying systems","source-relay joint precoding","multiple-input-multiple-output","amplify-and-forward","channel coding","singular-value-decomposition-based precoding schemes","signal space diversity","SM MIMO AF relaying systems"]},{"kwd":["Channel coded systems","diversity,multiple-input\u00bfmultiple-output (MIMO)","relay"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the diversity performance of source-relay joint precoding in spatial multiplexing (SM) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems with channel coding.

In addition, some improved criteria for global convergence are given. Compared with our previous work, a design parameter has been added in the projection neural network models, and it results in some improved performance. The simulation results on numerical examples are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292893","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6828828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6828828/06680760.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-Layer Continuous-and Discrete-Time Projection Neural Networks for Solving Variational Inequalities and Related Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680760/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"One-Layer Continuous-and Discrete-Time Projection Neural Networks for Solving Variational Inequalities and Related Optimization Problems","volume":"25","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6680760/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14396605","publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61105060"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0114"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK2011594"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"NPRP-4-1162-1-181"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"CUHK416811E and CUHK416812E"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273307"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-Layer Continuous-and Discrete-Time Projection Neural Networks for Solving Variational Inequalities and Related Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wang-2292893-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16459S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6828828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6828828","articleId":"6680760","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6680761,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085417787"},{"name":"Keshab K.

We make the structural assumption that the two vectors are members of known subspaces, one with dimension N and the other with dimension K. Although the observed convolution is nonlinear in both w and x, it is linear in the rank-1 matrix formed by their outer product wx*. This observation allows us to recast the deconvolution problem as low-rank matrix recovery problem from linear measurements, whose natural convex relaxation is a nuclear norm minimization program. We prove the effectiveness of this relaxation by showing that, for \u201cgeneric\u201d signals, the program can deconvolve w and x exactly when the maximum of N and K is almost on the order of L. That is, we show that if x is drawn from a random subspace of dimension N, and w is a vector in a subspace of dimension K whose basis vectors are spread out in the frequency domain, then nuclear norm minimization recovers wx* without error. We discuss this result in the context of blind channel estimation in communications. If we have a message of length N, which we code using a random L x N coding matrix, and the encoded message travels through an unknown linear time-invariant channel of maximum length K, then the receiver can recover both the channel response and the message when L \u2273 N + K, to within constant and log factors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Deconvolution Using Convex Programming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2294644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6739111/06680763.pdf","startPage":"1711","endPage":"1732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2294644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6739111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Blind Deconvolution Using Convex Programming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6680763/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14096827","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Deconvolution Using Convex Programming","sourcePdf":"tit-ahmed-2294644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112493S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6739111","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"6739111","articleId":"6680763","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6680764,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086632935"},{"name":"Yi-Fan Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Fan","lastName":"Li","id":"37086633879"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6680764","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2190},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Inductors","Phase modulation","Steady-state","Bridge circuits","DC-DC power converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","DC-DC power convertors","modulation","power inductors","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized phase shift modulation","asymmetric double-side modulation","fast transient response","dual active bridge DC-DC converter","equivalent series resistance","power inductor","transient modulation"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, two different phase-shift modulation used for the transient response of a dual-active-bridge dc/dc converter and their effects on the dynamics of the converter are discussed and compared.

Experimental results of the dynamics of the converter using different transient modulation techniques are also included for the purpose of validation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized Phase-Shift Modulation For Fast Transient Response in a Dual-Active-Bridge Converter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2294714","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6728657/06680764.pdf","startPage":"2661","endPage":"2665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2294714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728657","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized Phase-Shift Modulation For Fast Transient Response in a Dual-Active-Bridge Converter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6680764/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14057336","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized Phase-Shift Modulation For Fast Transient Response in a Dual-Active-Bridge Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-li-2294714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039122S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6728657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6728657","articleId":"6680764","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6680770,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["IBM Tokyo Research Lab, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6680770/6680770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Li (s'04\u2013M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2009, and the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2004.","She joined the IBM Thomas J.

To reach watt-level output power from a single-chip CMOS PA, two main strategies can be identified: use of high supply voltage and use of matching and power combination. High supply voltage limits are closely related to device design in the fabrication process. However, the maximum operating voltage can be improved by amplifier class selection, circuit solutions, and process modifications or mask changes. High output power can also be reached by the use of on-chip matching and power combination, commonly using on-chip transformers. Reliability often sets the limits for the PA design, and PA degradation mechanisms are reviewed. A compilation of state-of-the-art published results for linear and switched watt-level PAs, as well as a few fully integrated CMOS PAs, is presented and discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6701340/06680784.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2292608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2292608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Watt-Level CMOS RF Power Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Power generation","Radio frequency","System-on-chip","Switches","Linearity","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","masks","radiofrequency integrated circuits","radiofrequency power amplifiers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["watt-level integrated CMOS RF power amplifier","watt-level output power","single-chip CMOS PA","maximum operating voltage","circuit design solution","process modification","mask","on-chip matching","on-chip transformer","reliability","PA degradation mechanism","switched watt-level PA","linear watt-level PA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS power amplifiers (PAs)","integration","system-on-chip (SoC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Watt-Level CMOS RF Power Amplifiers","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6680784/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998035","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Watt-Level CMOS RF Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-johansson-2292608-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.270498S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6701340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6701340","articleId":"6680784","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6680785,"authors":[{"name":"Shiwen He","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, Southeast University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6710262/6680785/6680785-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shiwen He received M.S. degree from Chengdu University of Technology, China, in 2009.

In this paper we investigate energy efficient multicell multiuser precoding design and consider a new criterion of weighted sum energy efficiency, which is defined as the weighted sum of the energy efficiencies of multiple cells. This objective is more general than the existing methods and can satisfy heterogeneous requirements from different kinds of cells, but it is hard to tackle due to its sum-of-ratio form. In order to address this non-convex problem, the user rate is first formulated as a polynomial optimization problem with the test conditional probabilities to be optimized. Based on that, the sum-of-ratio form of the energy efficient precoding problem is transformed into a parameterized polynomial form optimization problem, by which a solution in closed form is achieved through a two-layer optimization. We also show that the proposed iterative algorithm is guaranteed to converge. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the effectiveness of our energy efficient beamforming algorithm. It is observed that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, the optimal energy efficiency and the optimal sum rate are simultaneously achieved by our algorithm; while in the middle-high SNR region, a certain performance loss in terms of the sum rate is suffered to guarantee the weighed sum energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2294595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2294595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6710262/06680785.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Multicell Multiuser Precoding for Maximizing Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Multicell Multiuser Precoding for Maximizing Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency","volume":"62","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680785/","publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14055374","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Multicell Multiuser Precoding for Maximizing Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2294595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126767S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6710262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6710262","articleId":"6680785","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6680787,"authors":[{"name":"Qilin Zhang","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, P.R.

Due to the openness, malicious service providers may exist in these environments. Some of these service providers could record service data in cloud service processes about a customer and then collectively deduce the customer's private information without authorisation. Noise obfuscation is an effective approach in this regard by utilising noise data. For example, it can generate and inject noise service requests into real customer service requests so that service providers are not able to distinguish which ones are real ones. However, existing typical noise obfuscations do not consider the customer-defined privacy-leakage-tolerance in noise obfuscation processes. Specifically, cloud customers could define a boundary of privacy leakage possibility to require noise obfuscation on privacy protection in cloud computing. In other words, under this boundary -- privacy-leakage-tolerance, noise obfuscation could be enhanced by the efficiency improvement on privacy protection, such as reducing noise service requests injected into real ones. So, the customer can obtain a lower cost on noise data in the pay-as-you-go fashion for cloud environments, with a reasonable effectiveness of privacy protection. Therefore, to address this privacy concern, a novel noise enhancing strategy can be presented. We firstly analyse the privacy-leakage-tolerance for cloud customers in terms of noise generation. Then, the creation of a noise generation set can be presented based on the privacy-leakage-tolerance, and the set can guide and enhance existing noise generation strategies by this boundary. Lastly, we present our novel privacy-leakage-tolerance based noise enhancing strategy for privacy protection in cloud computing. The simulation evaluation demonstrates that our strategy can significantly improve the efficiency of privacy protection on existing noise obfuscations in cloud environments.","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.64","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680816.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Privacy-Leakage-Tolerance Based Noise Enhancing Strategy for Privacy Protection in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680816/","displayDocTitle":"A Privacy-Leakage-Tolerance Based Noise Enhancing Strategy for Privacy Protection in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971255","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680816/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Privacy-Leakage-Tolerance Based Noise Enhancing Strategy for Privacy Protection in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072757S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6680817,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37066596500"},{"name":"Xuyun Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Xuyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37898426000"},{"name":"Chengfei Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information and Communication Technologies, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Chengfei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600001400"},{"name":"Yun Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Yang","id":"38546678200"},{"name":"Rajiv Ranjan","affiliation":["Information Engineering Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"38547753100"},{"name":"Dimitrios Georgakopoulos","affiliation":[""],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Georgakopoulos"},{"name":"Jinjun Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280682600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5022-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-898X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-9013"}],"articleNumber":"6680817","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Encryption","Processor scheduling","Information management","Data handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","distributed processing","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative hierarchical key exchange scheme","secure scheduling","big data applications","distributed computing platform","data intensive computation","cloud resources","cloud services","data security","authenticated key exchange","AKE","security system","symmetric key encryption","Internet key exchange","IKE","cloud background hierarchical key exchange","CBHKE","cloud computing environment","iterative key exchange"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","big data","key exchange","efficient security-aware scheduling","virtualisation security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680817","abstract":"As the new-generation distributed computing platform, cloud computing environments offer high efficiency and low cost for data-intensive computation in big data applications. Cloud resources and services are available in pay-as-you-go mode, which brings extraordinary flexibility and cost-effectiveness as well as zero investment in their own computing infrastructure. However, these advantages come at a price-people no longer have direct control over their own data. Based on this view, data security becomes a major concern in the adoption of cloud computing. Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) is essential to a security system that is based on high efficiency symmetric-key encryption. With virtualization technology being applied, existing key exchange schemes such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) becomes time-consuming when directly deployed into cloud computing environment. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical key exchange scheme, namely Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange (CBHKE). Based on our previous work, CBHKE aims at providing secure and efficient scheduling for cloud computing environment. In our new scheme, we design a two-phase layer-by-layer iterative key exchange strategy to achieve more efficient AKE without sacrificing the level of data security. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that when deployed in cloud computing environment, efficiency of the proposed scheme is dramatically superior to its predecessors CCBKE and IKE schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.65","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680817.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Hierarchical Key Exchange Scheme for Secure Scheduling of Big Data Applications in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Hierarchical Key Exchange Scheme for Secure Scheduling of Big Data Applications in Cloud Computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680817/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971399","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Hierarchical Key Exchange Scheme for Secure Scheduling of Big Data Applications in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076178S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6680837,"authors":[{"name":"Min Zheng","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085487607"},{"name":"Mingshen Sun","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Mingshen","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085484450"},{"name":"John C.S.

Unfortunately, they also become fertile grounds for hackers to deploy malware. There is an urgent need to have a \"security analytic & forensic system\" which can facilitate analysts to examine, dissect, associate and correlate large number of mobile applications. An effective analytic system needs to address the following questions: How to automatically collect and manage a high volume of mobile malware? How to analyze a zero-day suspicious application, and compare or associate it with existing malware families in the database? How to reveal similar malicious logic in various malware, and to quickly identify the new malicious code segment? In this paper, we present the design and implementation of DroidAnalytics, a signature based analytic system to automatically collect, manage, analyze and extract android malware. The system facilitates analysts to retrieve, associate and reveal malicious logics at the \"opcode level\". We demonstrate the efficacy of DroidAnalytics using 150, 368 Android applications, and successfully determine 2, 475 Android malware from 102 different families, with 327 of them being zero-day malware samples from six different families. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in showing such a large Android malware analysis/detection. The evaluation shows the DroidAnalytics is a valuable tool and is effective in analyzing malware repackaging and mutations.","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.25","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680837.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Droid Analytics: A Signature Based Analytic System to Collect, Extract, Analyze and Associate Android Malware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Droid Analytics: A Signature Based Analytic System to Collect, Extract, Analyze and Associate Android Malware","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680837/","accessionNumber":"13971233","publicationDate":"July 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Droid Analytics: A Signature Based Analytic System to Collect, Extract, Analyze and Associate Android Malware","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085736S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6680875,"authors":[{"name":"Sheikh Mahbub Habib","affiliation":["CASED, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Sheikh Mahbub","lastName":"Habib","id":"37594215300"},{"name":"Vijay Varadharajan","affiliation":["INSS Research Group, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Varadharajan","id":"37269498800"},{"name":"Max M\u00fchlh\u00e4user","affiliation":["CASED, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Max","lastName":"M\u00fchlh\u00e4user","id":"37328724600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5022-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-898X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-9013"}],"articleNumber":"6680875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680875","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Mechanical factors","Uncertainty","Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","decision theory","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust-aware framework","security controls evaluation","service providers","cloud marketplaces","trustworthy cloud service prevention","cloud security alliance","CSA","cloud platform","consumer requirement","trust properties","trust formalisation","hybrid trust notion","decision model","trust-aware security evaluation framework","hard trust mechanisms","soft trust mechanisms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security evaluation","Trustworthiness assessment","Soft trust","Hard trust","Uncertainty","Logic","Cloud marketplaces"]}],"abstract":"Trustworthy selection of cloud services has become a significant issue in emerging cloud marketplaces. As a consequence, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has formulated a self-assessment framework for cloud providers to publish their cloud platform's security controls and capabilities. This framework enables consumers to select a cloud service based on the capabilities and controls published by the providers. However, a fundamental question that arises is, how can consumers trust that the security controls are satisfied as claimed by the providers and are compliant with consumers' requirements. This paper proposes a trust-aware framework to verify and evaluate these security controls considering consumers' requirements. First, we model the security controls in the form of trust properties. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of these properties based on their semantics and identify the authorities who can validate the properties. The taxonomy of these properties is the basis of trust formalisation in our proposed framework. The framework rests on the notion of hybrid trust that combines hard and soft trust mechanisms for verifying the trust properties. Furthermore, a decision model is proposed as an integral part of the framework in order to empower consumers to determine trustworthiness of cloud providers. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed trust-aware security evaluation framework could be potentially useful in practice for consumers to determine trustworthy cloud providers in a competitive marketplace.","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680875.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"468","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Trust-Aware Framework for Evaluating Security Controls of Service Providers in Cloud Marketplaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Trust-Aware Framework for Evaluating Security Controls of Service Providers in Cloud Marketplaces","htmlLink":"/document/6680875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13971444","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Trust-Aware Framework for Evaluating Security Controls of Service Providers in Cloud Marketplaces","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069187S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6680877,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejiao Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Service Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuejiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085589678"},{"name":"Yingjie Xia","affiliation":["Institute of Service Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yingjie","lastName":"Xia","id":"37407393000"},{"name":"Shasha Jiang","affiliation":["Institute of Service Engineering, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shasha","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086783539"},{"name":"Fubiao Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Fubiao","lastName":"Xia","id":"38491802700"},{"name":"Yanbo Wang","affiliation":["Information and Communication Branch of Zhejiang Power Corporation, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085824341"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5022-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-898X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-9013"}],"articleNumber":"6680877","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":902},"abstract":"Access control is one of the most important security mechanisms in cloud computing. Attributed based encryption provides an approach that allows data owners to integrate data access policies within the encrypted data. However, little work has been done to explore flexible authorization in specifying the data user's privileges and enforcing the data owner's policy in cloud based environments. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical attribute based access control scheme by extending ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) with a hierarchical structure of multiauthorities and exploiting attribute-based signature (ABS). The proposed scheme not only achieves scalability due to its hierarchical structure, but also inherits fine-grained access control with authentication in supporting write privilege on outsourced data in cloud computing. In addition, we decouple the task of policy management from security enforcement by using the extensible access control markup language (XACML) framework. Extensive analysis shows that our scheme is both efficient and scalable in dealing with access control for outsourced data in cloud computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680877.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"484","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Attribute-Based Access Control with Authentication for Outsourced Data in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Access control","Encryption","Servers","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing","cryptography","digital signatures","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical attribute-based access control","authentication","cloud computing","security mechanisms","data access policies","data owner policy","data user privileges","ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption","CP-ABE","multiauthorities hierarchical structure","attribute-based signature","ABS","fine-grained access control","security enforcement","XACML framework","extensible access control markup language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CP-ABE","ABS","XACML","Access Control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Attribute-Based Access Control with Authentication for Outsourced Data in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680877/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971454","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Attribute-Based Access Control with Authentication for Outsourced Data in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073237S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6680879,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Duncan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Duncan","id":"38474001700"},{"name":"Sadie Creese","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Sadie","lastName":"Creese","id":"37592237800"},{"name":"Michael Goldsmith","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37588273600"},{"name":"Jamie S.

By using Cloud providers, organisations are reducing their capital expenditure on hardware, software and support, however, these same organisations are putting a great deal of trust in the provider offering a safe and secure platform for their data and resources. One of the biggest benefits of IaaS to the customer is the rapid elasticity of their provision. This elasticity can require relocation of a VM from one physical machine and / or one hypervisor to another. Whilst such migration is transparent and potentially seamless, it may also introduce vulnerability. We explore here the potential for a malicious insider to exploit vulnerabilities associated with mobile VMs to obtain large volumes of cloud-user data, and consider the possibility of detecting such attacks using current digital forensics and systems administration techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and

cloud technology. Cloud solutions include not only issues inherited from related technologies, such as virtualization and distributed computing, but also new concerns associated to complexity of the cloud ecosystem, composed by the cloud entities and their interactions. One of the concerns is related to authentication and authorization in the cloud in order to provide robust mechanisms to identify entities and establish their permissions and roles in the cloud, controlling resource usage and promoting accounting and isolation. This paper identifies the state of the art in terms of credential management focusing on the cloud ecosystem. It proposes a credential classification and a framework for studying and developing solutions in this context, unifying concepts related to cloud deployment models, service types, entities and lifecycle controls.","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.63","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680881.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Authentication and Authorization Credentials in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680881/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Authentication and Authorization Credentials in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971281","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680881/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Authentication and Authorization Credentials in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1367S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6680938,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmood A.

A large number of existing single-point search algorithms attempt to solve the problem by exploring possible structures and finding the one with the minimum free energy. However, these algorithms perform poorly on large sized proteins due to an astronomically wide search space. In this paper, we present a multi-point local search framework that uses parallel processing techniques to expedite exploration by starting from different points. In our approach, a set of random initial solutions are generated and distributed to different threads. We allow each thread to run for a pre-defined period of time. The improved solutions are stored thread-wise. When the threads finish, the solutions are merged together and the duplicates are removed. A selected distinct set of solutions are then split to different threads again. We tested our approach on large sized proteins for simplified models. The experimental results show that our new parallel framework significantly improves over the results obtained by the state-of-the-art single-point search approaches for the hydrophobic-polar energy model and the three dimensional face-centred-cubic lattice.","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.118","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680938.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Parallel Local Search for Simplified Protein Structure Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680938/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Parallel Local Search for Simplified Protein Structure Prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6680938/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Parallel Local Search for Simplified Protein Structure Prediction","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022a966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100823S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6680965,"authors":[{"name":"Mingzhe Zhang","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mingzhe","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38469092800"},{"name":"Da Wang","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Da","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086719019"},{"name":"Xiaochun Ye","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Ye","id":"37399073700"},{"name":"Liqiang He","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Inner Mongolia University, Huhhot, Inner Mongolia, China"],"firstName":"Liqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37269852700"},{"name":"Dongrui Fan","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongrui","lastName":"Fan","id":"37285218800"},{"name":"Zhiyong Liu","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086718893"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5022-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-898X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-9013"}],"articleNumber":"6680965","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Security","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","integrated optoelectronics","multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chip multiprocessor","optical components","manycore processors","manufacture technology","tile clusters","path adaptive optoelectronic hybrid NoC architecture","optical network layer","electronic network layer","mesh topology","onchip routers","performance degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical communication","network-on-chip","opto-electronic hybrid","path-adaptive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680965","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680965.pdf","startPage":"1198","endPage":"1205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.144","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Path-Adaptive Opto-electronic Hybrid NoC for Chip Multi-processor","abstract":"The continuous development of manufacture allows to integrate optical components in a chip, which providing a feasible solution for the communication between the cores in manycore processors. Considering the limitation of manufacture technology and the characteristics of optical communication, opto-electronic hybrid NoC is a reasonable choice currently. Today, common NoCs connect the separated tile-clusters with the optical network. With these structures, communications between cores in different tile-clusters must go through the optical network. Meanwhile, most of the applications can be hardly divided into isolated parallel parts, leading to un-avoidable communications between the tiles. Thus, the scalability and flexibility for various applications are limited. In this paper, we present path-adaptive opto-electronic hybrid NoC architecture. Rather than dividing the cores into separated clusters, the proposed structure provides an optical network layer and an electronic network layer in mesh topology. Furthermore, a modified routing strategy is implemented to allow the on-chip routers to decide whether transmit the packet through the optical links or the electronic ones, according to the distance between the source node and the destination. With this method, the NoC is flexible for diverse applications without scaling limitations or performance degradation. The experimental results show that, for a 256-core NoC, our proposed architecture gains 1.26x network efficiency comparing with the Corona, while reducing 21% power consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680965/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13971395","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6680965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Path-Adaptive Opto-electronic Hybrid NoC for Chip Multi-processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Path-Adaptive Opto-electronic Hybrid NoC for Chip Multi-processor","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022b198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080218S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6680966,"authors":[{"name":"Licheng Chen","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240382800"},{"name":"Yongbing Huang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yongbing","lastName":"Huang","id":"38195173000"},{"name":"Yungang Bao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yungang","lastName":"Bao","id":"37399184900"},{"name":"Guangming Tan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Tan","id":"37552741100"},{"name":"Zehan Cui","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Zehan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37903999100"},{"name":"Mingyu Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407023400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5022-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-898X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-9013"}],"articleNumber":"6680966","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":261},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Leveraging Memory Level Parallelism for DRAM System on Multi-core/Many-Core Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06680966.pdf","startPage":"1206","endPage":"1215","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.145","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Memory management","DRAM chips","Organizations","Parallel processing","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory level parallelism","DRAM system","multicore-many-core architecture","Moore law","processor chip","row buffer hit rate","RBHR","MLP","multimemory-controllers","multibank multirow-buffers","virtual channel memory","quality-of-service","QoS","memory controllers","VCM technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","Virtual Channel Memory","Memory Level Parallelism","Qos"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6680966","abstract":"DRAM system has been more and more critical on modern multi-core/many-core architecture where the Moore's law has been made effect on increasing the number of cores integrated in a processor chip. The performance of DRAM system is usually measured in term of bandwidth and latency, which are regarded as inherently depending on Row Buffer Hit Rate (RBHR) according to previous studies. In this paper, we find that Memory Level Parallelism (MLP) exhibits a stronger correlation with the performance of DRAM system on multi-core/many-core architecture than RBHR, and promoting MLP significantly improves DRAM system performance. In order to exploit the MLP, we have evaluated various approaches including multi-bank, multi-row-buffers, multi-memory-controllers and the obsolete Virtual Channel Memory (VCM). The experimental results show that VCM is a better alternative to traditional DRAM chip on multi-core/many-core architecture than the other three approaches because VCM has almost all the advantages of the others: 1) it can improve homogeneous workloads' IPC by 2.21X on a 16-core system with 32 virtual channels due to leveraging unexploited MLP. 2) It can also promote Quality-of-Service (QoS) of DRAM system by removing unfairness while memory controllers serve memory requests. 3) It can save energy and has low area costs. Unfortunately, VCM, which was proposed in the late 1990s, faded away before multi-core/many-core became dominated. Therefore, we suggest memory chip vendors reconsider the VCM technology for multi-core/many-core architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6680966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971220","htmlLink":"/document/6680966/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Study of Leveraging Memory Level Parallelism for DRAM System on Multi-core/Many-Core Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Leveraging Memory Level Parallelism for DRAM System on Multi-core/Many-Core Architecture","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022b206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080945S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6680966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6680989,"authors":[{"name":"Javeria Samad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, Latrobe University, Australia"],"firstName":"Javeria","lastName":"Samad","id":"37297587100"},{"name":"Seng W.

In this paper, we study temporal constraints and role-based constraints, and propose Temporal Constraint Consistency Problem (TCCP).

There is a need for the provider to acknowledge this subjective trust assessment by each client and provide services based on the trust assessment individually to each client. This paper proposes a policy based approach to the implementation of subjective trust for privacy policy enforcement in a cloud computing environment.

We prototype a storage middleware based on the abstract model and benchmark our system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06681018.pdf","startPage":"1573","endPage":"1580","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Subjective Trust for Privacy Policy Enforcement in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Servers","Encryption","Privacy","Monitoring","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","middleware","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy policy enforcement","cloud service providers","cloud service clients","subjective trust assessment","policy based approach","cloud computing environment","abstract model","storage middleware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["privacy","trust","cloud computing","dynamic trust","subjective trust"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"On Subjective Trust for Privacy Policy Enforcement in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681018/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971305","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Subjective Trust for Privacy Policy Enforcement in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022b573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093224S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6681018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6681036,"authors":[{"name":"Shouwen Yang","affiliation":["Information Security and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shouwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37075905900"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Information Security and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37075630000"},{"name":"Xiaotao Zhang","affiliation":["Information Security and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaotao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37075807200"},{"name":"Gang Zhao","affiliation":["Information Security and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086795407"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5022-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-898X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-9013"}],"articleNumber":"6681036","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"abstract":"Since it was accepted as the replacement of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and 3 DES by NIST in 2001, the AES has played a major role in various security-constrained applications. Many applications are power-saving, resource constrained and require high-speed. AES is precisely suitable for being implemented in both software and hardware applications. Hardware implementation of AES has the advantage of increased throughput and better security. On the basis of those facts, in this paper, different hardware architectures of AES have been presented and surveyed. And we present a way of data parallel to deal with the bulk data of plaintext or cipertext, which brings lower clock cycles and increased working frequencies. Pipelining architecture inside the round function also contributed a lot to the promotion of data throughput. Moreover, the key schedule algorithm is pipelined to get the speedup, and the S-boxes which are based on look-up tables (LUTs) could be area-efficient. By conducting ALTERA FPGA realization and ModelSim simulation, we analyze the performance relating to the Slice registers, gate-level netlists, memory, Slice LUTs and so on.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06681036.pdf","startPage":"1690","endPage":"1695","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Celerity Hardware Implementation of the AES with Data Parallel and Pipelining Architecture inside the Round Function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Clocks","Registers","Throughput","Pipeline processing","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","power aware computing","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["celerity hardware implementation","AES","data parallel architecture","data pipelining architecture","round function","data encryption standard","DES","security-constrained applications","software applications","hardware applications","plaintext data","cipertext data","clock cycles","S-boxes","look-up tables","ALTERA FPGA realization","ModelSim simulation","Slice registers","gate-level netlists","Slice LUT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES; Data parallel","Round Function Pipelining","High-throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Celerity Hardware Implementation of the AES with Data Parallel and Pipelining Architecture inside the Round Function","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681036/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971231","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Celerity Hardware Implementation of the AES with Data Parallel and Pipelining Architecture inside the Round Function","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022b690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08736S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6681036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6681052,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Yang","id":"38490005700"},{"name":"Xingang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xingang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539090200"},{"name":"Lan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089062214"},{"name":"Laurence T.

Big Data Processing is involved in our daily life such as mobile devices, RFID and wireless sensors, which aims at dealing with billions of users' interactive data. At the same time, real-time processing is eagerly needed in integrated system. In this paper, several technologies associated with real-time big data processing are introduced, among which the core technology called Storm is emphasized.

However, to achieve this performance gain demands huge computation complexity. For its lower cost and better flexibility, the GPU-based LDPC decoder is an emerging research subject. Based on the perspective of GPU hardware architecture, a multi-stage optimizing mapping strategy (MSOMS) is proposed and implemented to accelerate LDPC decoding. The performance is boosted significantly by balancing the memory access and computation load, optimizing execution configuration and the memory access pattern, and fully utilizing the on-chip high speed resources. Proposed decoders can achieve 383-and 442-speedup compared to CPU-based decoder for LDPC and RA code (another ensemble of LDCP code), and the achieved throughput is comparable to existed GPU-based decoders, which confirm the efficiency of the MSOMS strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TrustCom.2013.233","publicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679587/6680793/06681070.pdf","startPage":"1901","endPage":"1906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6680793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimizing Strategy Research of LDPC Decoding Based on GPGPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681070/","displayDocTitle":"An Optimizing Strategy Research of LDPC Decoding Based on GPGPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971293","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681070/","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimizing Strategy Research of LDPC Decoding Based on GPGPU","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"5022b901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062009S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679587","isNumber":"6680793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679587","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6680793","articleId":"6681070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6681094,"authors":[{"name":"Anusha Dharmaraj","affiliation":["School of Computing Sciences and Informatics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH"],"firstName":"Anusha","lastName":"Dharmaraj","id":"37086735649"},{"name":"Hailong Li","affiliation":["School of Computing Sciences and Informatics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Li","id":"38241169600"},{"name":"Nishan Weragama","affiliation":["School of Computing Sciences and Informatics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH"],"firstName":"Nishan","lastName":"Weragama","id":"37086634002"},{"name":"Dharma P.

A typical indoor coverage of an FC is tens of meters and could cover several rooms. When Femto base stations (F-BS) are densely deployed, interference between them becomes an unavoidable issue. Hence, there is an immediate need for a robust interference management technique before femtocells can be extensively adopted for commercial purpose. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that takes into account dynamic topology of FCs and carefully allocates communication channels to each F-BS. This also addresses the co-domain interference problem in FCs. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate the novelty of our proposed scheme, called as distributed topology-based spectrum allocation. This avoids spectrum overlap that facilitates efficient resource allocation for each cell, thereby enabling low interference under high resource utilization and increased reuse efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSA.2013.13","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679925/6681074/06681094.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSA.2013.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Topology-Based Resource Allocation for a Femtocell-Based Cellular Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681094/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Topology-Based Resource Allocation for a Femtocell-Based Cellular Network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13971873","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681094/","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Topology-Based Resource Allocation for a Femtocell-Based Cellular Network","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"5045a013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051877S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679925","isNumber":"6681074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679925","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6681074","articleId":"6681094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6681095,"authors":[{"name":"Hai V.

Reducer gear-sets are used in various traditional and modern industries. In the production of a reducer, the vibration and noise signals of the gear-set are usually used to determine the defective products or defective positions. Unfortunately, conventional fault diagnosis by humans is limited effectiveness and has no numerical standards. In the present study, the vibration signal of the gear-set is used to evaluate the proposed fault diagnosis technique. In the experimental work, feature extraction by Wigner-Ville distribution is proposed for analyzing fault signals in the reducer gear-set platform. Artificial neural network techniques using both a general regression neural network and conventional back-propagation network are compared in the system. The experimental results show the vibration can be used to monitor the condition of the gear-set platform and the general regression neural network (GRNN) has a better recognition rate and less recognition time than the back-propagation neural network (BPNN).","doi":"10.1109/ICCSA.2013.34","startPage":"170","endPage":"173","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSA.2013.34","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681074","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679925/6681074/06681117.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fault Diagnosis System for a Mechanical Reducer Gear-Set Using Wigner-Ville Distribution and an Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681117/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Fault Diagnosis System for a Mechanical Reducer Gear-Set Using Wigner-Ville Distribution and an Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681117/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13971866","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault Diagnosis System for a Mechanical Reducer Gear-Set Using Wigner-Ville Distribution and an Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"5045a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061491S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679925","isNumber":"6681074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679925","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6681074","articleId":"6681117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6681240,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Ficco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell' Informazione, Second University of Naples (SUN), Aversa, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Ficco","id":"37265508500"},{"name":"Luca Tasquier","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell' Informazione, Second University of Naples (SUN), Aversa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Tasquier","id":"38466559500"},{"name":"Rocco Aversa","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale e dell' Informazione, Second University of Naples (SUN), Aversa, Italy"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"Aversa","id":"37304085200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5094-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6681240","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":740},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion Detection in Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Eighth International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679944/6681156/06681240.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"283","publicationTitle":"2013 Eighth International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681156","doi":"10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.47","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Cloud computing","Monitoring","Intrusion detection","Probes","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","hierarchical architecture","event correlation analysis","multiple distributed security components","multilayer architecture","security solutions","cloud providers","distributed architecture","distributed intrusion detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","intrusion detection","distributed event correlation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681240","abstract":"Cloud Computing represents both a technology for using computing infrastructures in a more efficient way, and a business model for selling computing resources and services.

data-centric and application-oriented Wireless Sensor Network, effective energy-saving is an eternal theme, while in the scenarios deployed multiple flows, the network resource competition directly influences the whole network performance. To address this issue, a cooperative routing scheme is developed by comprehensively taking both the routing selection and contention avoidance into account, in which, for the delay-tolerant sensing tasks, the concept of abstract domain is introduced to extend the coverage relay nodes, and the cooperative routings are carefully selected in terms of the specific sensing and transmission requirements. Simulation conducted on NS-2 platform demonstrates that the proposed cooperative routing outperforms the compared routing selection strategies in significantly balancing the energy distribution and prolonging the network lifetime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681249/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972160","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Routing for Multi-flow Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Routing for Multi-flow Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Compiegne, France","sourcePdf":"5094a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049237S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679944","isNumber":"6681156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679944","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6681156","articleId":"6681249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6681257,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Cai","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Cai","id":"37877499500"},{"name":"Zhutian Chen","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhutian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086670235"},{"name":"Huaqing Min","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huaqing","lastName":"Min","id":"37551659100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5094-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6681257","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681257","abstract":"Distributed coordination is critical for a multi-robot system in collective cleanup task under a dynamic environment.

Currently, those applications are often written for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in one of the supported modeling languages such as structured text, ladder diagrams and grafcets. The consequences of this approach are that (1) PLC experts are needed to develop the application, (2) it is difficult to verify the application's correctness and (3) when introducing other technologies such as embedded micro controllers, even more experts are needed. This paper proposes an MDE development process that addresses these problems. The use of a domain specific language eliminates the need for PLC experts, and developers can concentrate on the development of the building automation application. Models of the system or a transformation of those models to Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), State chart, or Causal Block Diagram (CBD) formalisms can be used to verify, simulate and optimize the application based on user needs. In a last step, the code for the target platforms can be generated directly from the verified and optimized models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681277/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972146","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model Driven Engineering for Building Automation, a Research Agenda","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Driven Engineering for Building Automation, a Research Agenda","confLoc":"Compiegne, France","sourcePdf":"5094a485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10367S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679944","isNumber":"6681156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679944","xplore-issue":"6681156","articleId":"6681277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6681294,"authors":[{"name":"Noriki Uchida","affiliation":["Depertment of Informational Social Studies, Saitama Institute of Technology, Fukaya, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriki","lastName":"Uchida","id":"37392752400"},{"name":"Kazuo Takahata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Human and Social Studies, Saitama Institute of Technology, Fukaya, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuo","lastName":"Takahata","id":"37289209100"},{"name":"Yoshitaka Shibata","affiliation":["Faculty of Software and Information science, Iwate Prefectural University, Takizawa, Iwate, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshitaka","lastName":"Shibata","id":"37269452500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5094-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6681294","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal of Business Intelligence System by Overlay Cloud Computing Architecture","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Eighth International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679944/6681156/06681294.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"581","publicationTitle":"2013 Eighth International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681156","doi":"10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.100","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Kalman filters","Business","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","competitive intelligence","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business intelligence system","overlay cloud computing architecture","business opportunities","QoS management","virtual network layer","autonomous network configuration","virtual autonomous network configuration","Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Virtualization","Business Inteligence","QoS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681294","abstract":"In case of cloud computing service for business usages, with the growth of business opportunities such as the increased number of employee or commerce site's access, the efficient resource or QoS management in virtual network layer come to be more important. Also, autonomous network configuration in virtual layer which can provide optimal efficient resource and QoS service is needed. Not only network configuration is constructed in physical layer, but also it is needed to be constructed in virtual layer for future services. In this paper, it is discussed about Overlay Cloud Computing Architecture which is consisted of virtual autonomous network configuration in cloud computing service including various server and network services for business intelligent system. In our proposal methods, first of all, there are various kinds of autonomous modes such as eco mode, high power mode, and secure mode. Then, virtual network and server configuration is automatically held in virtual layer with the proper mode setting. Besides, with observation values of network and server condition, virtual configuration is changed optimally. In this optimal configuration changing, Kalman filter is used for the calculation of network and server condition. Then, the prototype of the proposed methods is reported, and the future study is discussed in the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972118","htmlLink":"/document/6681294/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Proposal of Business Intelligence System by Overlay Cloud Computing Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal of Business Intelligence System by Overlay Cloud Computing Architecture","confLoc":"Compiegne, France","sourcePdf":"5094a578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073622S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679944","isNumber":"6681156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679944","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6681156","articleId":"6681294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6681301,"authors":[{"name":"Johnatan E.

Traditionally, WSN applications are developed using programming languages such as C and java, this approach poses a steep learning curve for application developers, e.g. scientists and engineers, who might have limited knowledge of programming. This paper proposes a model-driven engineering (MDE) platform for WSN which is designed for application developers to rapidly implement and test a WSN application. It leverages the notion of feature modeling so that it allows developers to graphically and intuitively specify features (e.g., functionality and configuration policies) in their application. It also validate a set of constrains among features and finally generates runnable application code. For testing, it uses a formal method in order to estimate various properties of application code such as network lifetime.

Previous work has emphasized face tracking and registration and the choice of features classifiers. Relatively neglected is the effect of imbalanced data for action unit detection. While the machine learning community has become aware of the problem of skewed data for training classifiers, little attention has been paid to how skew may bias performance metrics. To address this question, we conducted experiments using both simulated classifiers and three major databases that differ in size, type of FACS coding, and degree of skew. We evaluated influence of skew on both threshold metrics (Accuracy, F-score, Cohen's kappa, and Krippendorf's alpha) and rank metrics (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and precision-recall curve). With exception of area under the ROC curve, all were attenuated by skewed distributions, in many cases, dramatically so. While ROC was unaffected by skew, precision-recall curves suggest that ROC may mask poor performance. Our findings suggest that skew is a critical factor in evaluating performance metrics. To avoid or minimize skew-biased estimates of performance, we recommend reporting skew-normalized scores along with the obtained ones.","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2013.47","startPage":"245","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent

model based HMMs (GMM-HMMs). In this paper, for emotion recognition from speech, we investigate DNN-HMMs with restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) based unsupervised pre-training, and DNN-HMMs with discriminative pre-training. Emotion recognition experiments are carried out on these two models on the eNTERFACE'05 database and Berlin database, respectively, and results are compared with those from the GMM-HMMs, the shallow-NN-HMMs with two layers, as well as the Multi-layer Perceptrons HMMs (MLP-HMMs). Experimental results show that when the numbers of the hidden layers as well hidden units are properly set, the DNN could extend the labeling ability of GMM-HMM. Among all the models, the DNN-HMMs with discriminative pre-training obtain the best results. For example, for the eNTERFACE'05 database, the recognition accuracy improves 12.22% from the DNN-HMMs with unsupervised pre-training, 11.67% from the GMM-HMMs, 10.56% from the MLP-HMMs, and even 17.22% from the shallow-NN-HMMs, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971897","htmlLink":"/document/6681449/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Deep Neural Network--Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) Based Speech Emotion Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Deep Neural Network--Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) Based Speech Emotion Recognition","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"5048a312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057932S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679936","isNumber":"6681389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679936","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6681389","articleId":"6681449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6681456,"authors":[{"name":"Timur R.

In this paper we propose the novel dynamic appearance descriptor Local Gabor Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes (LGBP-TOP), combining the previous success of LGBP-based expression recognition with TOP extensions of other descriptors. LGBP-TOP combines spatial and dynamic texture analysis with Gabor filtering to achieve unprecedented levels of recognition accuracy in real-time. While TOP features risk being sensitive to misalignment of consecutive face images, a rigorous analysis of the descriptor shows the relative robustness of LGBP-TOP to face registration errors caused by errors in rotational alignment. Experiments on the MMI Facial Expression and Cohn-Kanade databases show that for the problem of FACS Action Unit detection, LGBP-TOP outperforms both its static variant LGBP and the related dynamic appearance descriptor LBP-TOP.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679936/6681389/06681456.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2013.65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2013.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Gabor Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes for Automatic Facial Expression Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Gold","Histograms","Face recognition","Robustness","Databases","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Gabor filters","image registration","image texture","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic facial expression recognition","dynamic texture descriptors","facial action detection","static variants","dynamic appearance descriptor","local Gabor binary patterns from three orthogonal planes","LGBP-TOP","dynamic texture analysis","spatial texture analysis","Gabor filtering","face images","rotational alignment","face registration errors","MMI facial expression","Cohn-Kanade databases","FACS action unit detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facial Expression","Dynamic Appearance Descriptors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Local Gabor Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes for Automatic Facial Expression Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681456/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971951","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Gabor Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes for Automatic Facial Expression Recognition","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"5048a356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067704S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679936","isNumber":"6681389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679936","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6681389","articleId":"6681456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6681481,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Deng","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Deng","id":"38248056200"},{"name":"Zixing Zhang","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Zixing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38239957800"},{"name":"Erik Marchi","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Marchi","id":"37075554100"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Schuller","affiliation":["Machine Intelligence & Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Schuller","id":"37283946000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5048-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8111"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8103"}],"articleNumber":"6681481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":149,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3073},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681481","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech recognition","Training","Emotion recognition","Databases","Standards","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse autoencoder-based feature transfer learning","speech emotion recognition","training data","test data","system development","recogniser performance","emotion-specific mapping rule","target domain","data reconstruction","standard databases","source domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech emotion recognition","transfer learning","sparse autoencoder","deep neural networks"]}],"abstract":"In speech emotion recognition, training and test data used for system development usually tend to fit each other perfectly, but further 'similar' data may be available. Transfer learning helps to exploit such similar data for training despite the inherent dissimilarities in order to boost a recogniser's performance. In this context, this paper presents a sparse auto encoder method for feature transfer learning for speech emotion recognition. In our proposed method, a common emotion-specific mapping rule is learnt from a small set of labelled data in a target domain. Then, newly reconstructed data are obtained by applying this rule on the emotion-specific data in a different domain. The experimental results evaluated on six standard databases show that our approach significantly improves the performance relative to learning each source domain independently.","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2013.90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2013.90","startPage":"511","endPage":"516","publicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679936/6681389/06681481.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Autoencoder-Based Feature Transfer Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681481/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Autoencoder-Based Feature Transfer Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13972007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681481/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Autoencoder-Based Feature Transfer Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"5048a511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072016S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679936","isNumber":"6681389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679936","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6681389","articleId":"6681481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6681496,"authors":[{"name":"Jacqueline Wijsman","affiliation":["Factulty of Electrical Engineering, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jacqueline","lastName":"Wijsman","id":"37857960700"},{"name":"Bernard Grundlehner","affiliation":["Body Area Networks, Holst Centre/imec, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Grundlehner","id":"37667271000"},{"name":"Hao Liu","affiliation":["Body Area Networks, Holst Centre/imec, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Liu","id":"38239862200"},{"name":"Julien Penders","affiliation":["Body Area Networks, Holst Centre/imec, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Penders","id":"37393105000"},{"name":"Hermie Hermens","affiliation":["Factulty of Electrical Engineering, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hermie","lastName":"Hermens","id":"37573073000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5048-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8111"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8103"}],"articleNumber":"6681496","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1038},"abstract":"Timely mental stress detection can help to prevent stress-related health problems.

The correlation analysis showed that the higher-reported stress level was related to activity level, SMS and screen on/off patterns.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stress Recognition Using Wearable Sensors and Mobile Phones","publicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2013.117","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679936/6681389/06681508.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2013.117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Stress Recognition Using Wearable Sensors and Mobile Phones","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681508/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13971980","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stress Recognition Using Wearable Sensors and Mobile Phones","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"5048a671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058978S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679936","isNumber":"6681389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679936","citationCount":"211","xplore-issue":"6681389","articleId":"6681508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6681554,"authors":[{"name":"Eleni Kroupi","affiliation":["Multimedia Signal Processing Group (MMSPG), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Kroupi","id":"38468217500"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Vesin","affiliation":["Applied Signal Processing Group (ASPG), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Vesin","id":"37338609600"},{"name":"Touradj Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Multimedia Signal Processing Group (MMSPG), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"],"firstName":"Touradj","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37273737500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5048-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8111"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8103"}],"articleNumber":"6681554","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Thyristors","Couplings","Physiology","Synchronization","Multimedia communication","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science","decision making","electroencephalography","emotion recognition","inference mechanisms","medical signal processing","multimedia computing","physiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-amplitude coupling","EEG","EDA","multimedia content","emotion","social relationships","rational thinking","decision making","reasoning","computer science","physiological signals","electroencephalography signals","skin conductance response","SCR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","EDA","phase-amplitude coupling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681554","abstract":"Emotion is a dynamic process that affects social relationships and influences the mechanisms of rational thinking and decision making. The influence of emotion on reasoning has gained a lot of attention in computer science. One approach to incorporating emotions into computers is by extracting features from various physiological signals and inferring the corresponding emotions or emotional dimensions. However, physiological processes are dynamic rather than static, and physiological signals mainly interact with each other during emotional processes rather than act individually. This study suggests that dynamical interdependencies of various signals that emanate from either the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system might be involved in the emotional experience. Specifically, EEG (electroencephalography) signals captured from the temporal lobe are coupled with a narrow-band skin conductance response (SCR) while subjects are watching music clips, indicating that signals from the auditory cortex interact with SCR during this experience.","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2013.162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2013.162","startPage":"865","endPage":"870","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679936/6681389/06681554.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Amplitude Coupling between EEG and EDA While Experiencing Multimedia Content","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Amplitude Coupling between EEG and EDA While Experiencing Multimedia Content","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681554/","accessionNumber":"13971972","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681554/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Amplitude Coupling between EEG and EDA While Experiencing Multimedia Content","confLoc":"Geneva, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"5048a865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064379S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679936","isNumber":"6681389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679936","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6681389","articleId":"6681554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6681556,"authors":[{"name":"Carina Walter","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Eberhard-Karls University T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carina","lastName":"Walter","id":"37086756267"},{"name":"Stephanie Schmidt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Eberhard-Karls University T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37086756162"},{"name":"Wolfgang Rosenstiel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Eberhard-Karls University T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Rosenstiel","id":"37267029700"},{"name":"Peter Gerjets","affiliation":["Knowledge Media Research Center, T\u00fcbingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Gerjets","id":"38234252200"},{"name":"Martin Bogdan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Bogdan","id":"37265888300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5048-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2156-8111"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-8103"}],"articleNumber":"6681556","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Algebra","Training","Support vector machines","Electrodes","Electroencephalography","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","computer aided instruction","electroencephalography","signal classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-task classification","workload levels classification","complex learning tasks","cognitive load theory","WL","learner memory capacity","electroencephalogram based learning environments","support vector machines","SVM","EEG-signals","generalized classifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","Support Vector Machines","EEG","Workload"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Cross-Task Classification for Classifying Workload Levels in Complex Learning Tasks","doi":"10.1109/ACII.2013.164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681389","endPage":"881","publicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679936/6681389/06681556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACII.2013.164","startPage":"876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681556","abstract":"According to Cognitive Load Theory the type and amount of workload (WL) during learning is crucial for successful learning and should be held within an optimal range of learners' memory capacity.

Therefore, the present study examined cross-task classification accuracies for SVMs trained on EEG-signals, recorded while participants (N= 21) had to solve three working memory tasks. While within-task classification accuracies were high for WM tasks (average: 95% - 97 %), cross-task classification performances were not significant over chance level.

One big challenge for diagnosing an abnormal distributed application is to pinpoint the faulty components. In this paper, we present a black-box online fault localization system called FChain that can pinpoint faulty components immediately after a performance anomaly is detected. FChain first discovers the onset time of abnormal behaviors at different components by distinguishing the abnormal change point from many change points caused by normal workload fluctuations. Faulty components are then pinpointed based on the abnormal change propagation patterns and inter-component dependency relationships. FChain performs runtime validation to further filter out false alarms. We have implemented FChain on top of the Xen platform and tested it using several benchmark applications (RUBiS, Hadoop, and IBM System S). Our experimental results show that FChain can quickly pinpoint the faulty components with high accuracy within a few seconds. FChain can achieve up to 90% higher precision and 20% higher recall than existing schemes. FChain is non-intrusive and light-weight, which imposes less than 1% overhead to the cloud system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679374/6681559/06681572.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FChain: Toward Black-Box Online Fault Localization for Cloud Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Benchmark testing","Web servers","Runtime","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed applications","cloud systems","performance anomaly detection","resource contentions","software bugs","hardware failures","abnormal distributed application diagnosis","faulty components","black-box online fault localization system","FChain","abnormal behaviors","normal workload fluctuations","abnormal change propagation patterns","intercomponent dependency relationships","runtime validation","Xen platform","RUBiS","Hadoop","IBM System S"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"FChain: Toward Black-Box Online Fault Localization for Cloud Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971076","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FChain: Toward Black-Box Online Fault Localization for Cloud Systems","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5000a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088644S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679374","isNumber":"6681559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679374","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6681559","articleId":"6681572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6681593,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guangzhou HKUST Fok Ying Tung Research Institute"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38244196300"},{"name":"Kaishun Wu","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center of Digital Life, Sun Yat-sen University"],"firstName":"Kaishun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404409500"},{"name":"Youwen Yi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guangzhou HKUST Fok Ying Tung Research Institute"],"firstName":"Youwen","lastName":"Yi","id":"37400344200"},{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guangzhou HKUST Fok Ying Tung Research Institute"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38241025000"},{"name":"Lionel M.

In this paper, we present Pilot, a Channel State Information (CSI)-based DfP indoor localization system in WLAN. Pilot design is motivated by the observations that PHY layer CSI is capable of capturing the environment variance due to frequency diversity of wideband channel, such that the position where the entity located can be uniquely identified by monitoring the CSI feature pattern shift. Therefore, a ``passive'' radio map is constructed as prerequisite which include fingerprints for entity located in some crucial reference positions, as well as clear environment. Unlike device-based approaches that directly percepts the current state of entities, the first challenge for DfP localization is to detect their appearance in the area of interest. To this end, we design an essential anomaly detection block as the localization trigger relying on the CSI feature shift when entity emerges. Afterwards, a probabilistic algorithm is proposed to match the abnormal CSI to the fingerprint database to estimate the positions of potential existing entities. Finally, a data fusion block is developed to address the multiple entities localization challenge. We have implemented Pilot system with commercial IEEE 802.11n NICs and evaluated the performance in two typical indoor scenarios. It is shown that our Pilot system can greatly outperform the corresponding best RSS-based scheme in terms of anomaly detection and localization accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.49","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679374/6681559/06681593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681559","startPage":"236","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot: Passive Device-Free Indoor Localization Using Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot: Passive Device-Free Indoor Localization Using Channel State Information","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681593/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971058","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot: Passive Device-Free Indoor Localization Using Channel State Information","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5000a236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110021S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679374","isNumber":"6681559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679374","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6681559","articleId":"6681593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":6681595,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Liu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38666561800"},{"name":"Haojin Zhu","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haojin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37289613100"},{"name":"Rong Du","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Du","id":"37852675300"},{"name":"Cailian Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Cailian","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185843900"},{"name":"Xinping Guan","affiliation":["Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinping","lastName":"Guan","id":"37275635400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5000-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"6681595","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Privacy","Cryptography","Channel estimation","Databases","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","data privacy","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location privacy preserving","dynamic spectrum auction","cognitive radio network","bidders","privacy preserving bid submission protocol","private spectrum distribution protocol","TTP","trusted third party","Google Earth Coverage Maps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Location Privacy","Dynamic Spectrum Auction","Prefix Membership Verification"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic spectrum auction offers the flexibility and capability for bidders to request and acquire unoccupied channels from spectrum license holders.

To thwart this attack, we introduce a new Location Privacy Preserving Dynamic Spectrum Auction (LPPA) scheme which consists of two components: Privacy Preserving Bid Submission protocol (PPBS) and Private Spectrum Distribution protocol (PSD). Based on the prefix membership verification scheme, PPBS allows the auctioneer to construct the conflict relationship between different users and obtain the maximum value of bids on various channels without leaking users' location information. Furthermore, PSD is proposed to efficiently distribute the spectrum among bidders and securely charge the winners with the help of periodically available TTP (Trusted Third Party). To demonstrate the effectivenss of the proposed scheme, we implement our attack and scheme on data extracted from Google Earth Coverage Maps released by FCC.

Although significant efforts have been recently made, existing BFT protocols do not provide acceptable performance when faults occur. As we show in this paper, this comes from the fact that all existing BFT protocols targeting high throughput use a special replica, called the primary, which indicates to other replicas the order in which requests should be processed. This primary can be smartly malicious and degrade the performance of the system without being detected by correct replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called RBFT for Redundant-BFT: we execute multiple instances of the same BFT protocol, each with a primary replica executing on a different machine. All the instances order the requests, but only the requests ordered by one of the instances, called the master instance, are actually executed. The performance of the different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance. If that is not the case, the primary replica of the master instance is considered malicious and replaced. We implemented RBFT and compared its performance to that of other existing robust protocols. Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3%, whereas it is at least equal to 78% for existing protocols.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RBFT: Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.53","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679374/6681559/06681599.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"RBFT: Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681599/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971077","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBFT: Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5000a297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080887S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679374","isNumber":"6681559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679374","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6681559","articleId":"6681599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6681609,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086767475"},{"name":"Di Niu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409788400"},{"name":"Baochun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Baochun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085349451"},{"name":"Ben Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Liang","id":"37287338100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5000-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"6681609","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":592},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Dynamic programming","Pricing","Approximation algorithms","Equations","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cloud computing","dynamic programming","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic cloud resource reservation","infrastructure-as-a-service clouds","pricing options","cloud brokerage service","cloud providers","dynamic programming","approximate algorithms","large-scale Google cluster-usage traces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cloud Brokerage","Cloud Resource Reservation"]}],"abstract":"Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds offer diverse pricing options, including on-demand and reserved instances with various discounts to attract different cloud users. A practical problem facing cloud users is how to minimize their costs by choosing among different pricing options based on their own demands. In this paper, we propose a new cloud brokerage service that reserves a large pool of instances from cloud providers and serves users with price discounts. The broker optimally exploits both pricing benefits of long-term instance reservations and multiplexing gains. We propose dynamic strategies for the broker to make instance reservations with the objective of minimizing its service cost. These strategies leverage dynamic programming and approximate algorithms to rapidly handle large volumes of demand. Our extensive simulations driven by large-scale Google cluster-usage traces have shown that significant price discounts can be realized via the broker.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Cloud Resource Reservation via Cloud Brokerage","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679374/6681559/06681609.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Cloud Resource Reservation via Cloud Brokerage","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681609/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971078","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Cloud Resource Reservation via Cloud Brokerage","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5000a400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05688S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679374","isNumber":"6681559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679374","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6681559","articleId":"6681609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6681620,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["University of Waterloo"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38238086600"},{"name":"Mohamed Faten Zhani","affiliation":["University of Waterloo"],"firstName":"Mohamed Faten","lastName":"Zhani","id":"37393442600"},{"name":"Raouf Boutaba","affiliation":["University of Waterloo"],"firstName":"Raouf","lastName":"Boutaba","id":"37275592200"},{"name":"Joseph L.

Dynamic capacity provisioning is a promising approach for reducing energy consumption by dynamically adjusting the number of active machines to match resource demands. However, despite extensive studies of the problem, existing solutions for dynamic capacity provisioning have not fully considered the heterogeneity of both workload and machine hardware found in production environments. In particular, production data centers often comprise several generations of machines with different capacities, capabilities and energy consumption characteristics. Meanwhile, the workloads running in these data centers typically consist of a wide variety of applications with different priorities, performance objectives and resource requirements. Failure to consider heterogenous characteristics will lead to both sub-optimal energy-savings and long scheduling delays, due to incompatibility between workload requirements and the resources offered by the provisioned machines. To address this limitation, in this paper we present HARMONY, a Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Management System for dynamic capacity provisioning in cloud computing environments. Specifically, we first use the K-means clustering algorithm to divide the workload into distinct task classes with similar characteristics in terms of resource and performance requirements. Then we present a novel technique for dynamically adjusting the number of machines of each type to minimize total energy consumption and performance penalty in terms of scheduling delay. Through simulations using real traces from Google's compute clusters, we found that our approach can improve data center energy efficiency by up to 28% compared to heterogeneity-oblivious solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.28","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679374/6681559/06681620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681559","startPage":"510","endPage":"519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmony: Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Provisioning in the Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Harmony: Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Provisioning in the Cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681620/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971103","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681620/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmony: Dynamic Heterogeneity-Aware Resource Provisioning in the Cloud","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5000a510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066713S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679374","isNumber":"6681559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679374","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6681559","articleId":"6681620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6681622,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085489792"},{"name":"Tarek Abdelzaher","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Abdelzaher","id":"37267896800"},{"name":"Lance Kaplan","affiliation":["Networked Sensing & Fusion Branch, US Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD"],"firstName":"Lance","lastName":"Kaplan","id":"37271026000"},{"name":"Charu C.

We consider a category of crowdsourcing applications where a group of individuals volunteer (or are recruited to) share certain observations or measurements about the physical world. Examples include reporting locations of gas stations that remain operational after a natural disaster or reporting locations of potholes on city streets. We call such applications social sensing. Ascertaining the correctness of reported observations is a key challenge in such applications, referred to as the truth estimation problem. This problem is made difficult by the fact that the reliability of individual sources is usually unknown a priori, since any concerned citizen may, in principle, participate. Moreover, the timescales of crowdsourcing campaigns of interest can be as small as a few hours or days, which does not offer enough history for a reputation system to converge. Instead, recent prior work, including our own, developed fact-finding algorithms to solve this problem by iteratively assessing the credibility of sources and their claims in the absence of reputation scores. Such algorithms, however, operate on the entire dataset of reported observations in a batch fashion, which makes them less suited to applications where new observations arrive continually. In this paper, we describe a streaming fact-finder that recursively updates previous estimates based on new data. The recursive algorithm solves an expectation maximization (EM) problem to determine the odds of correctness of different observations. We compare the performance of our recursive EM algorithm to a batch EM algorithm, as well as to several state-of-art fact-finders through extensive simulations. We also demonstrate convergence of the recursive algorithm to the results of the batch version through a real social sensing experiment. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach can process data streams much more efficiently while keeping the truth estimation accuracy close to that of the (much slower) batch algorithm. Ours is therefore the first fact-finder developed with explicit consideration to the continuous update needs of crowd-sourcing applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2013.54","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679374/6681559/06681622.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2013.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Fact-Finding: A Streaming Approach to Truth Estimation in Crowdsourcing Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681622/","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Fact-Finding: A Streaming Approach to Truth Estimation in Crowdsourcing Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13971046","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681622/","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Fact-Finding: A Streaming Approach to Truth Estimation in Crowdsourcing Applications","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"5000a530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132033S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679374","isNumber":"6681559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679374","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6681559","articleId":"6681622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6681647,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Safavi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Safavi","id":"37398545400"},{"name":"Ali Akbar Safavi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali Akbar","lastName":"Safavi","id":"37086654992"},{"name":"Pedram Veisi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Veisi","id":"37086715804"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5268-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5267-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-6982"}],"articleNumber":"6681647","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational institutions","Smart phones","Laboratories","Electronic learning","Process control","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","control engineering computing","control engineering education","laboratories","programmable controllers","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote PLC laboratory","virtual PLC laboratory","smart phones","programmable logic controller","information and communication technology","engineering education","engineering training","control tools","programming software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Remote and Virtual Laboratory","E-Learning","Smartphones","PLC"]}],"abstract":"In today's technological world, the role of information and communication technology in education and training is quite important.

Thus, improvement of middle-of-line and back-end-of-line (BEOL) materials and process technology (e.g., to achieve reduced barrier material thickness or dielectric permittivity) has always been a key goal in the technology roadmap. However, to date there has not been any systematic quantification of the value of BEOL technology improvements on integrated circuit (LC) design metrics. In this work, we create a framework to study the impact of improvements in interconnect technology on IC designs. Using 45nm technology and benchmark designs from public sources, we map reductions of interconnect resistance and/or capacitance to resulting impacts on design power, performance and area - for various types of physical design and operating contexts. By quantifying potential benefits of interconnect technology improvements at a block or core level, our proposed framework complements lower-level (e.g., critical-path) projections. We believe that this type of early assessment can be useful to guide BEOL technology investments and targets, especially as technology improvements require ever-increasing resources and focus in R&D efforts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Resistance","Capacitance","Wires","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC design","interconnect technology","public sources","interconnect resistance","interconnect capacitance","BEOL technology","size 45 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681680","doi":"10.1109/SLIP.2013.6681680","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 ACM/IEEE International Workshop on System Level Interconnect Prediction (SLIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675895/6681674/06681680.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLIP.2013.6681680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681680/","displayDocTitle":"Toward quantifying the IC design value of interconnect technology improvements","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-2 June 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13974310","htmlLink":"/document/6681680/","conferenceDate":"2-2 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward quantifying the IC design value of interconnect technology improvements","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"Session21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062793S","chronDate":"2-2 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675895","isNumber":"6681674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675895","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6681674","articleId":"6681680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6681709,"authors":[{"name":"Jinliang Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation for Process Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, P.R.

Based on the G-NSGA-II [1], the random immigrant populations are introduced to enhance the diversity of population firstly. Secondly, the fitness function is calculated for the second parent and offspring when the variation occurs, and uses these fitness values of the new evolutionary computation to acquire optimal solution of dynamic multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed approach is validated using the actual production data collected from an iron ore beneficiation process. The experiment study on the constraint conditions (i.e. the equipment capability) changing with the working conditions in the planning optimization of production index decision problem is carried out. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can follow the changes of the environment, and be able to acquire the new environment optimal solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6676471/6681691/06681709.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"581","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization for planning of mineral processing under varied equipment capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shafts","Cyclones","Gold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mineral processing","production planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environment optimal solution","production index decision problem","constraint conditions","iron ore beneficiation process","dynamic multiobjective optimization problem","optimal solution","evolutionary computation","random immigrant populations","G-NSGA-II","elitism approach","dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithm","multiobjective plan optimization problem","equipment capability","mineral processing","planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mineral processing","production indices","planning optimization","multi-objective optimization","dynamic optimization","varied equipment capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization for planning of mineral processing under varied equipment capability","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681709/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977102","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization for planning of mineral processing under varied equipment capability","confLoc":"Luoyang, China","sourcePdf":"FriM0401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064502S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6676471","isNumber":"6681691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676471","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6681691","articleId":"6681709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6681712,"authors":[{"name":"Liangyong Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Liangyong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539351700"},{"name":"Chengyan Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chengyan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086712902"},{"name":"Wenjuan Cui","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Wenjuan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37086716172"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2519-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2518-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0690"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0682"}],"articleNumber":"6681712","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681712","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator dynamics","PD control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underactuated mechanical systems","data driven balance control strategy","linear models","proportional derivative controller","PD controller","unmodeled dynamic compensator","modelling error","Pendubot","pendulum robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underactuated manipulator","balance control","unmodeled dynami","PD control"]}],"abstract":"Unmodeled dynamics and data driven balance control strategy are presented in this paper for a class of underactuated mechanical systems with two freedoms. The idea behind the method are as follows. First, the underactuated system is divided into two subsystems. Linear models for each subsystem are constructed from the experimental datum. The proportional derivative (PD) controller can be designed by this linear model. The unmodeled dynamic compensator is designed to deal with modelling error between the linear model and the real model. Second, to control two outputs of the underactuated systems with one input at the same time, a coordinative control scheme is introduced for weighting the control inputs of the two subsystems. Finally, in order to value the proposed control scheme, the Pendubot (pendulum robot) is selected as the experimental platform to verify the method. Experimental results show that the proposed control strategy can be easily applied and has higher control precision than the existing methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681712","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6676471/6681691/06681712.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"597","doi":"10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unmodeled dynamics and data driven balance control for a class of underactuated mechanical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Unmodeled dynamics and data driven balance control for a class of underactuated mechanical systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681712/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977028","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681712/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unmodeled dynamics and data driven balance control for a class of underactuated mechanical systems","confLoc":"Luoyang, China","sourcePdf":"FriM0404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045713S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6676471","isNumber":"6681691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676471","xplore-issue":"6681691","articleId":"6681712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6681717,"authors":[{"name":"Liyuan Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Liyuan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086655938"},{"name":"Yirong Yao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yirong","lastName":"Yao","id":"38468278900"},{"name":"Quan Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085499311"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2519-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2518-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0690"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0682"}],"articleNumber":"6681717","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Robustness","Algorithm design and analysis","Minimization","Educational institutions","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integral equations","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical sequence deviation integral algorithm","multiobjective optimization","integral global optimization theory","Monte-carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","Hierarchical sequence method","Deviation integral","Monte-carlo technique"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681717","abstract":"To study the multi-objective optimization, the concept of related step length is proposed firstly.

The core of the system is a personalized set of basic configurations of the human hand to facilitate given tasks, referred to as use-patterns. In the concept, the system first senses the positions of the remaining, healthy digits using resistive flex sensors mounted onto a glove. Then, an algorithm using a Z-score metric compares the flex sensor readings to a large set of training data to determine which of several use-patterns the current situation corresponds to. A control system can then move a bionic digit into the intended position corresponding to the use-pattern detected, completing the grip. MATLAB simulations were run to determine the accuracy of this concept on five exemplary use-patterns. The success rate with one amputated digit was 96.5% and the success rate with two amputated digits was 92.5%. This demonstrates the feasibility of a simple, intuitive, and low-cost prosthetic control system based on this premise that could deliver even higher success rates when personalized with self-learning algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681737","startPage":"724","endPage":"729","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6676471/6681691/06681737.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel predictive approach to prosthetic control for digit amputations using grip classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel predictive approach to prosthetic control for digit amputations using grip classification","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681737/","accessionNumber":"13977008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681737/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel predictive approach to prosthetic control for digit amputations using grip classification","confLoc":"Luoyang, China","sourcePdf":"FriP0504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052487S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6676471","isNumber":"6681691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676471","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6681691","articleId":"6681737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6681749,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Song","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Song","id":"37086784264"},{"name":"Hongchun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hongchun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086784813"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2519-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2518-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0690"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0682"}],"articleNumber":"6681749","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681749","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Mechatronics","Neural networks","Optimized production technology","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Bayes methods","genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMBRGA hybrid algorithm","optimization algorithms","Chengdu","network model","LMBRA","BPNN","BP neural networks","genetic algorithm","Levenberg-Marquardt Bayesian regularization algorithm","hybrid algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BPNN","LM algorithm","Bayesian regularization algorithm","GA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681749","pdfPath":"/iel7/6676471/6681691/06681749.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems","startPage":"51","endPage":"56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMechS.2013.6681749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid algorithm based on Levenberg-Marquardt Bayesian Regularization Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"In order to overcome the insufficiencies of the convergence of the low speed, a low precision of the forecast and easy convergence to a local minimum point of error function on BP Neural Networks (BPNN), a new hybrid algorithm-LMBRGA, which uses both the Levenberg-Marquardt(LM) Bayesian Regularization Algorithm(LMBRA) and Genetic Algorithm(GA) to optimize BPNN, is proposed. The specific process was as follows. Firstly, the GA optimized the best weights and thresholds as the training initial values of BPNN. Then, the BPNN after initialization was trained by the LMBRA until the network has converged. Finally, the network model, which met the requirements after being examined by the test samples, was applied to predict the resident consumption level of Chengdu.

In virtualized data centers, consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs) on the minimum number of physical servers has been recognized as a very efficient approach, as this allows unloaded servers to be switched off or used to accommodate more load, which is clearly a cheaper alternative to buy more resources. The consolidation problem must be solved on multiple dimensions, since in modern data centers CPU is not the only critical resource: depending on the characteristics of the workload other resources, for example, RAM and bandwidth, can become the bottleneck. The problem is so complex that centralized and deterministic solutions are practically useless in large data centers with hundreds or thousands of servers. This paper presents ecoCloud, a self-organizing and adaptive approach for the consolidation of VMs on two resources, namely CPU and RAM. Decisions on the assignment and migration of VMs are driven by probabilistic processes and are based exclusively on local information, which makes the approach very simple to implement. Both a fluid-like mathematical model and experiments on a real data center show that the approach rapidly consolidates the workload, and CPU-bound and RAM-bound VMs are balanced, so that both resources are exploited efficiently.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2013.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6731364","startPage":"215","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/6731364/06681861.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Self-Organizing Cloud Data Centers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681861/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Self-Organizing Cloud Data Centers","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-December 2013","accessionNumber":"14078152","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Self-Organizing Cloud Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tcc2013020215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105271S","chronDate":"July-December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"6731364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6731364","articleId":"6681861","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6681863,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Ericson C.

We reviewed the applications intended to complement traditional curriculum materials for K-12. We found 87 research articles on augmented reality learning experiences (ARLEs) in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and other learning technology publications. Forty-three of these articles conducted user studies, and seven allowed the computation of an effect size to the performance of students in a test. In our meta-analysis, research show that ARLEs achieved a widely variable effect on student performance from a small negative effect to a large effect, with a mean effect size of 0.56 or moderate effect. To complement this finding, we performed a qualitative analysis on the design aspects for ARLEs: display hardware, software libraries, content authoring solutions, and evaluation techniques. We explain that AR incur three inherent advantages: real world annotation, contextual visualization, and vision-haptic visualization. We illustrate these advantages through the exemplifying prototypes, and ground these advantages to multimedia learning theory, experiential learning theory, and animate vision theory. Insights from this review are aimed to inform the design of future ARLEs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2014","volume":"7","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14284184","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2014","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6681863/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Reality Learning Experiences: Survey of Prototype Design and Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Augmented Reality Learning Experiences: Survey of Prototype Design and Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tlt-santos-37-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179726S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"6812165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"6812165","articleId":"6681863","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6681876,"authors":[{"name":"Hyein Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyein","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085474584"},{"name":"Seungjun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungjun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37067455000"},{"name":"Hyungsoon Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungsoon","lastName":"Shin","id":"37271406500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6681876","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"The switching time of the magnetic tunnel junction for spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory is investigated as a function of the current.

By representing a test pixel as a linear combination of a small subset of labeled pixels, a sparse representation classifier (SRC) gives rather plausible results compared with that of traditional classifiers such as the support vector machine. Recently, by incorporating additional structured sparsity priors, the second-generation SRCs have appeared in the literature and are reported to further improve the performance of HSI. These priors are based on exploiting the spatial dependences between the neighboring pixels, the inherent structure of the dictionary, or both. In this letter, we review and compare several structured priors for sparse-representation-based HSI classification. We also propose a new structured prior called the low-rank (LR) group prior, which can be considered as a modification of the LR prior. Furthermore, we will investigate how different structured priors improve the result for the HSI classification.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2013.2290531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6763162/06681879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2013.2290531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6763162","startPage":"1235","endPage":"1239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured Priors for Sparse-Representation-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Structured Priors for Sparse-Representation-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14179011","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6681879/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1117545"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"60219-MA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N000141210765"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Priors for Sparse-Representation-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"lgrs-sun-2290531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081653S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6763162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6763162","articleId":"6681879","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6681880,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Chien Huang","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Institute of Nanoscience, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/6603336/6681880/6681880-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Chien Huang was born in I-Lan, Taiwan, on August, 21, 1972.

This paper investigates the effect of vignetting for a pixelated system using spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Our analysis shows that vignetting causes attenuation and intercarrier interference (ICI) in the spatial frequency domain. MATLAB simulations indicate that for a given constellation size, spatial asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (SACO-OFDM) is more robust to vignetting than spatial dc biased optical OFDM (SDCO-OFDM). Moreover, for the case of SDCO-OFDM, the very large zeroth subcarrier causes severe ICI in its neighbourhood causing flattening of the bit error rate (BER) curves. We show that this BER floor can be eliminated by leaving some of the lower spatial frequency subcarriers unused. The BER performance can also be improved by applying a vignetting estimation and equalization scheme. Finally, it is shown that equalized SACO-OFDM with 16-QAM has the same overall data rate as equalized SDCO-OFDM using 4-QAM, but requires less optical power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Effect of Vignetting on MIMO Optical Wireless Systems Using Spatial OFDM","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2294647","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6710256/06681890.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2294647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681890/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Effect of Vignetting on MIMO Optical Wireless Systems Using Spatial OFDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6681890/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","publicationDate":"March1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14031760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Effect of Vignetting on MIMO Optical Wireless Systems Using Spatial OFDM","sourcePdf":"jlt-mondal-2294647-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067274S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6710256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6710256","articleId":"6681890","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6681894,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Materials Engineering, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538053300"},{"name":"Xuan Anh Tran","affiliation":["Global Foundries, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xuan Anh","lastName":"Tran","id":"37395690700"},{"name":"Zheng Fang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37401389800"},{"name":"Hao D.

An aggregated model of renewable wind and solar power generation forecast is proposed to support the quantification of the operational reserve for day-ahead and real-time scheduling. Then, a droop control for power electronic converters connected to battery storage is developed and tested. Compared with the existing droop controls, it is distinguished in that the droop curves are set as a function of the storage state-of-charge (SOC) and can become asymmetric. The adaptation of the slopes ensures that the power output supports the terminal voltage while at the same keeping the SOC within a target range of desired operational reserve. This is shown to maintain the equilibrium of the microgrid's real-time supply and demand. The controls are implemented for the special case of a dc microgrid that is vertically integrated within a high-rise host building of an urban area. Previously untapped wind and solar power are harvested on the roof and sides of a tower, thereby supporting delivery to electric vehicles on the ground. The microgrid vertically integrates with the host building without creating a large footprint.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2294738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6728629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2294738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6728629/06681907.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC Microgrid for Wind and Solar Power Integration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"DC Microgrid for Wind and Solar Power Integration","volume":"2","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681907/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14057314","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681907/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"DC Microgrid for Wind and Solar Power Integration","sourcePdf":"jestpe-strunz-2294738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146137S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6728629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"6728629","articleId":"6681907","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6681921,"authors":[{"name":"Mingquan Bao","affiliation":["Broadband Technologies, Ericsson AB, M\u00f6lndal, SE, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mingquan","lastName":"Bao","id":"37267360400"},{"name":"Rumen Kozhuharov","affiliation":["Dept. of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, SE, Sweden"],"firstName":"Rumen","lastName":"Kozhuharov","id":"37284869700"},{"name":"Herbert Zirath","affiliation":["Dept. of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, SE, Sweden"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"Zirath","id":"37275066000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6681921","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":987},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Gain","Transistors","Power system harmonics","Power generation","Frequency conversion","Transmission line measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar MIMIC","frequency multipliers","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","MMIC frequency convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output frequency range","dc power","InP DHBT technology","conversion gain","third harmonics","common-emitter transistor","converting stage","harmonics generating stage","high power-efficiency D-band frequency tripler MMIC","size 0.25 mum","frequency 110 GHz to 155 GHz","power 45 mW","InP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DHBT","frequency multiplier","InP"]}],"abstract":"A novel frequency tripler consisting of a harmonics generating stage and a converting stage is proposed.

Then, considering the state-dependent properties of memristor, a fuzzy model of MNNs is employed to provide a new way of analyzing the complicated MNNs with only two subsystems, and update laws for the connection weights of slave systems and controller gain are designed to make the slave systems exponentially lag synchronized with the master systems. Two examples about synchronization problems are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, and an application of the obtained theory is also given in the pseudorandom number generator.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/6963534/06681944.pdf","startPage":"1704","endPage":"1713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2294855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2013.2294855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963534","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential Adaptive Lag Synchronization of Memristive Neural Networks via Fuzzy Method and Applications in Pseudorandom Number Generators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Memristors","Neural networks","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","exponential distribution","fuzzy control","neural nets","random number generation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential lag synchronization control","memristive neural networks","MNN","fuzzy method","pseudorandom number generators","PRNG","slave system connection weights","controller gain design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive lag synchronization","fuzzy model","memristor","neural networks","pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Exponential Adaptive Lag Synchronization of Memristive Neural Networks via Fuzzy Method and Applications in Pseudorandom Number Generators","volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6681944/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14786632","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125303 and 61203286"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Adaptive Lag Synchronization of Memristive Neural Networks via Fuzzy Method and Applications in Pseudorandom Number Generators","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-zeng-2294855-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101266S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6963534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6963534","articleId":"6681944","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6681945,"authors":[{"name":"Hyungil Chae","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6722899/6681945/6681945-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyungil Chae (M'06) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1981.

Essentially, there are two major technologies responsible for the growth, namely wind and photovoltaic. The technologies involved in harnessing energy from wind and sun are distinctly different in dynamic characteristics and limitations. Consequently, their influence on stability of power system should not be overlooked. This paper examines the small-disturbance angle stability with high penetration of renewable energy and proposes a methodology to control. The hierarchical principal component analysis, which is a clustering method corresponding to the eigenvalue sensitivity of reactive power control, is utilized to select the renewable generator clusters for different reactive power control scheme. Then, the framework based on structured singular value has been employed, in which the reactive power controls of renewable generator clusters are selected such that the desired robust stability criterion is satisfied. Results obtained in 16-machine 68-bus test system (typically used for small-signal angle stability studies) show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6681946/","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239110","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Small-Disturbance Angle Stability Control With High Penetration of Renewable Generations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Disturbance Angle Stability Control With High Penetration of Renewable Generations","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-shah-2292615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126826S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6799261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6799261","articleId":"6681946","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":6681949,"authors":[{"name":"Masaaki Nagahara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Nagahara","id":"37274787900"},{"name":"Daniel E.

A robustness constraint is proposed to handle the external disturbances. Based on this, a novel robust distributed MPC scheme is designed for the overall agent system. Furthermore, the feasibility of the robust distributed MPC scheme and the robust stability of the overall agent system are analyzed, respectively. The conditions under which the proposed MPC is feasible and the overall agent system is robustly stabilized are established.

The complete closed-form modal solutions are presented for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes in the isosceles right triangular waveguide. The resonant frequencies of a resonator made of a short isosceles right triangular waveguide can then be calculated. A structure called a quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide (QMSIW) is introduced to realize the proposed triangular waveguide resonator in a compact and planar form. Simulated electric field distributions of modes excited in the QMSIW are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the solid waveguide structure, demonstrating the feasibility of QMSIW resonators. Finally, a compact triple-mode filter is designed and fabricated based on the discussed QMSIW. The frequency responses and group delay of the filter are tested, and measured results agree very well with simulated ones. This demonstrates that the proposed QMSIW structure is an excellent candidate for compact triple-mode filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6701340/06681956.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2293128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2293128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Triple-Mode Filter Based on Quarter-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance","Substrates","Boundary conditions","Magnetic separation","Waveguide components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay filters","frequency response","modal analysis","network synthesis","resonator filters","substrate integrated waveguides","waveguide filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quartermode substrate integrated waveguide","isosceles right triangular waveguide","electric wall","magnetic wall","closed-form modal solution","transverse magnetic mode","transverse electric mode","QMSIW","triangular waveguide resonator","electric field distribution","solid waveguide structure","compact triple-mode filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact bandpass filter","half-mode/quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide (QMSIW)","isosceles right triangular waveguide","triple-mode filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compact Triple-Mode Filter Based on Quarter-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide","volume":"62","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6681956/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998039","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Triple-Mode Filter Based on Quarter-Mode Substrate Integrated Waveguide","sourcePdf":"tmtt-cheng-2293128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073512S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6701340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6701340","articleId":"6681956","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6681961,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantin D.

This paper presents an investigation of process bus protection performance, since the inservice behavior of multifunction process buses is largely unknown. An experimental approach was adopted that used a Real Time Digital Simulator and \u201clive\u201d substation automation devices. The effect of sampling synchronization error and network traffic on transformer differential protection performance was assessed and compared to conventional hard-wired connections. Ethernet was used for all sampled value measurements, circuit breaker tripping, transformer tap-changer position reports, and precision time protocol synchronization of sampled value merging unit sampling. Test results showed that the protection relay under investigation operated correctly with process bus network traffic approaching 100% capacity. The protection system was not adversely affected by synchronizing errors significantly larger than the standards permit, suggesting that these requirements may be overly conservative. This \u201cclosed loop\u201d approach, using substation automation hardware, validated the operation of protection relays under extreme conditions. Digital connections using a single shared Ethernet network outperformed conventional hard-wired solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2291789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6819482/06681962.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2291789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System-Level Tests of Transformer Differential Protection Using an IEC 61850 Process Bus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681962/","displayDocTitle":"System-Level Tests of Transformer Differential Protection Using an IEC 61850 Process Bus","volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14318915","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681962/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System-Level Tests of Transformer Differential Protection Using an IEC 61850 Process Bus","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-ingram-2291789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062037S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6819482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6819482","articleId":"6681962","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6681972,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37081300300"},{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenguang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37404783000"},{"name":"Zhongke Shi","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhongke","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278373100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6681972","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":169,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Approximation methods","Discrete-time systems","Learning systems","Output feedback","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning output feedback NN control","deterministic learning technique","adaptive-critic-based neural network controller","nonlinear pure-feedback systems","controller design","predictor form","actor-critic NN control architecture","strategic utility function","partial persistent excitation condition","internal states","periodic reference orbit tracking control","closed-loop signal uniformly ultimate boundedness","Lyapunov stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate dynamic programming","discrete-time system","output feedback control","pure-feedback system","radial basis function neural network (RBF NN)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Humans","Models, Neurological","Nonlinear Dynamics","Online Systems","Reinforcement (Psychology)","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a novel adaptive-critic-based neural network (NN) controller is investigated for nonlinear pure-feedback systems. The controller design is based on the transformed predictor form, and the actor-critic NN control architecture includes two NNs, whereas the critic NN is used to approximate the strategic utility function, and the action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the tracking error. A deterministic learning technique has been employed to guarantee that the partial persistent excitation condition of internal states is satisfied during tracking control to a periodic reference orbit. The uniformly ultimate boundedness of closed-loop signals is shown via Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Output Feedback NN Control Using Deterministic Learning Technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292704","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6740874/06681972.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740874","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6681972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning Output Feedback NN Control Using Deterministic Learning Technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6681972/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111773","pubMedId":"24807456","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning Output Feedback NN Control Using Deterministic Learning Technique","sourcePdf":"tnnls-xu-2292704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124184S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6740874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"6740874","articleId":"6681972","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6681976,"authors":[{"name":"Clara Gouveia","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP), Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Clara Gouveia received her M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP), Portugal, in 2008 and is currently pursuing her Ph.D. degree in power systems from the same university.

This demands a coordinated approach for integrating DG in the network, allowing the DG units to actively contribute to frequency and voltage regulation. Microgrids can provide such coordination by aggregating DG, (controllable) loads, and storage in small-scale networks, which can operate in both grid-connected and islanded mode. In this article, the islanded operating condition is considered. As in the conventional networks, a hierarchical control structure can be implemented in islanded microgrids. In recent years, many different concepts for primary, secondary, and tertiary control of microgrids have been investigated. These controllers can be classified as either local or centralized. In this article, the hierarchical control for application in microgrids is discussed, and an overview of the control strategies is given with respect to the reserve provision by the DG units, loads, and storage equipment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4154573/6681963/06681994.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2013.2279306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2013.2279306","startPage":"42","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microgrids: Hierarchical Control and an Overview of the Control and Reserve Management Strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681994/","displayDocTitle":"Microgrids: Hierarchical Control and an Overview of the Control and Reserve Management Strategies","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6681994/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"13969714","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microgrids: Hierarchical Control and an Overview of the Control and Reserve Management Strategies","sourcePdf":"mie-vandoorn-2279306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128492S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"6681963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"6681963","articleId":"6681994","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6681998,"authors":[{"name":"Taha Selim Ustun","affiliation":["Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, AUSTRALIA"],"bio":{"p":["Taha Selim Ustun (ustun@cmu.edu) received his B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Turkey, in 2007 and his master of engineering science degree from the University of Malaya, Malaysia, in 2009.

As it is spread over a vast surface area, Australia has high car usage and ownership rates, and the inefficiency of the public transportation system contributes to this. Therefore, Australia has a very large potential market for EVs. In addition to the well-known advantages, such as zero direct emissions, reduced dependency on oil, cheaper fuel, and more silent operation through smart grids, EVs also offer a unique benefit called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Through V2G technology, EVs can support better operation of the smart grids in terms of reliability and storage. Based on reliable statistics and social studies, this article studies the EV potential of Australia and envisages the impact of large EV utilization therein. The statistics indicate that the growing population will demand more cars, and acceptance of EVs could also benefit other areas, such as environmental conservation, finance, and energy production. Accordingly, a microgrid system with V2G technology has been modeled and simulated in three different conditions: islanded, IEEE-T14-bus system, and IEEE-34-bus system. The results are presented to forecast the necessary changes in the power networks for the large deployment of EVs.","doi":"10.1109/MIE.2013.2273947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4154573/6681963/06681998.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIE.2013.2273947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Vehicle Potential in Australia: Its Impact on Smartgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6681998/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Electric Vehicle Potential in Australia: Its Impact on Smartgrids","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13969711","htmlLink":"/document/6681998/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Vehicle Potential in Australia: Its Impact on Smartgrids","sourcePdf":"mie-ustun-2273947-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079239S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4154573","isNumber":"6681963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6681963","articleId":"6681998","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IMAGE LICENSED BY INGRAM PUBLISHINGCorwn","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6682042,"authors":[{"name":"Dzmitry Kliazovich","affiliation":["University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Kliazovich","id":"37283713000"},{"name":"Sisay T.

In the environment of HeNBs densely deployment, the proposed scheme will turn the unnecessary HeNBs into sleep mode, and only the neceesary HeNBs are still in the active mode, which aims to save the energy in the networks. Then, we evaluate the user's quality of service (QoS) under different factors. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme not only improves the QoS of the femto user (HUE), but also enhances the capacity of the system and saves the energy.","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.46","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679957/6682013/06682060.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collaborative Sleeping Scheme for Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682060/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Sleeping Scheme for Femtocell Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972370","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682060/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Sleeping Scheme for Femtocell Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5046a142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.176314S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679957","isNumber":"6682013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679957","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6682013","articleId":"6682060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6682075,"authors":[{"name":"Ayesha Kanwal","affiliation":["National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ayesha","lastName":"Kanwal","id":"37085744626"},{"name":"Rahat Masood","affiliation":["National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rahat","lastName":"Masood","id":"38303635500"},{"name":"Um E.

Besides several benefits of Cloud computing, there are still many challenging issues such as security and privacy of data stored on Cloud and lack of trust on Cloud service providers. Trust is one of the major barriers in the growth and adoption of Cloud by the IT industry due to absence of any reliable and efficient trust evaluation mechanism. Various trust management models have been proposed, but there exists no criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in Cloud computing. In this regard, we have proposed an assessment criterion for the evaluation of trust models, containing the essential features that are mandatory for trust establishment in Cloud environment. We have also presented a detailed analysis of existing trust models and analyzed them with respect to our proposed assessment criteria. The assessment and analysis of trust models helps the customers to select the most appropriate and reliable model in accordance with their preferences and requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment Criteria for Trust Models in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.61","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679957/6682013/06682075.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Assessment Criteria for Trust Models in Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682075/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972477","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment Criteria for Trust Models in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5046a254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08315S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679957","isNumber":"6682013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679957","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6682013","articleId":"6682075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6682078,"authors":[{"name":"Sau-Hsuan Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300"],"firstName":"Sau-Hsuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281056700"},{"name":"Hsi-Lu Chao","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300"],"firstName":"Hsi-Lu","lastName":"Chao","id":"37273526900"},{"name":"Chun-Hsien Ko","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300"],"firstName":"Chun-Hsien","lastName":"Ko","id":"37715788500"},{"name":"Shang-Ru Mo","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300"],"firstName":"Shang-Ru","lastName":"Mo","id":"38247878600"},{"name":"Chiau-Feng Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300"],"firstName":"Chiau-Feng","lastName":"Liang","id":"38247449600"},{"name":"Chung-Chieh Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 300"],"firstName":"Chung-Chieh","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38247624600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5046-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6682078","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":517},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Internet","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cloud computing","cognitive radio","metropolitan area networks","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["green spectrum sharing","cloud-based cognitive radio access network","cloud computing resource","cross-layer C2-RAN functions","spectrum resource sharing","channel allocation","power allocation","user scheduling","medium access control","public cloud platform","TV white space","low-power cognitive radio access points","wireless metropolitan area network","power consumption","C2-RAN MAN","3G MAN","3G system","broadband wireless access","bit rate 726.4 Gbit/s","power 203.6 kW","bandwidth 180 MHz","bit rate 8 Gbit/s","power 940.2 kW","frequency 15 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682078","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.64","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","abstract":"Based on the vast and elastic cloud computing resource, a cloud-based cognitive radio access networking (C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-RAN) service model is studied in this work.

In this work, we propose a data-driven story generation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT based techniques enable the real time collection of the elderly's environment data through various sensors located in the home. The story generation system can weave the information mined from the sensor data into a story with high persuasive and emotion arousing power. Our system automatically collects raw sensor data on the cloud server and maps them to values of semantically meaningful context variables through activity functions.

In this paper we exclusively apply the machine learning ensemble learning algorithm Random Forest supervised classifier on an Android feature dataset of 48919 points of 42 features each. Our goal was to measure the accuracy of Random Forest in classifying Android application behavior to classify applications as malicious or benign. Moreover, we wanted to focus on detection accuracy as the free parameters of the Random Forest algorithm such as the number of trees, depth of each tree and number of random features selected are varied. Our experimental results based on 5-fold cross validation of our dataset shows that Random Forest performs very well with an accuracy of over 99 percent in general, an optimal Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error rate [3] of 0.0002 for forests with 40 trees or more, and a root mean squared error of 0.0171 for 160 trees.","doi":"10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.122","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679957/6682013/06682136.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682013","startPage":"663","endPage":"669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Forest Classification for Detecting Android Malware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random Forest Classification for Detecting Android Malware","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682136/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972180","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682136/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Forest Classification for Detecting Android Malware","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5046a663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081464S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679957","isNumber":"6682013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679957","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6682013","articleId":"6682136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6682152,"authors":[{"name":"Chunsheng Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37672306500"},{"name":"Victor C.M.

However, there exists two main weaknesses in existing FH systems, i.e., the low communication resource (frequency, time) utilization rate when there are more than two users in the communication network, and lacking of extra ability to resist spot jamming. In order to cope with these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a novel frequency hopping scheme based on the spectrum sensing of Cognitive Radio, which increases the resource utilization rate of FH system by allotting resources in real time, while reduces the spot jamming by sensing the communications environment. Considering the high cost of too many resource-allotting, we also propose a novel method which allots resources unevenly as a compromise to get higher resource utilization rate with fewer times of resource-allotting. The BER and other performance metrics of our scheme are studied through comparative simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682227/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13972460","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682227/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Frequency Hopping Scheme Based on Cognitive Radio for Aircraft","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Frequency Hopping Scheme Based on Cognitive Radio for Aircraft","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5046b231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05697S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679957","isNumber":"6682013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679957","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6682013","articleId":"6682227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6682234,"authors":[{"name":"Guorui Li","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Guorui","lastName":"Li","id":"37405548900"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Qinhuangdao Institute of Technology, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086774756"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5046-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6682234","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Data communication","Matching pursuit algorithms","Encryption","Sparse matrices","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","cryptography","data communication","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure data transmission scheme","compressive sensing theory","signal reconstruction","linear measurements","encryption processes","decryption processes","signal encryption","signal decryption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Security","Perfect secrecy","Restricted isometry property"]}],"abstract":"In compressive sensing theory, a signal can be reconstructed from a small set of non-adaptive, linear measurements if the signal can be represented as a sparse object in some orthonormal basis.

How to reduce energy consumption has become an important research issue. This study considers the location-aware cloud storage (CS) selection to implement a remote data backup as a strategic to tackle energy efficiency. To satisfy the green computing, a tradeoff between user access (which locates in several locations) and backup (which stores the data at least in two data centers) were balanced to minimize the energy consumption. The objective of minimum energy consumption subjects to the required link and nodal capacity, service level, access proportion, delay, and CSs selection. This work has developed network, access distribution, delay, and energy consumption models as well as proposed a remote backup mechanism.

two dimensional Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radiometer (SAIR) called BHU-2D-U has been developed. The radiometer can obtain images in real-time benefiting from the adoption of the Digital Correlation Unit (DCU). The DCU requires a data acquisition module to digitalize the received analog signal and a correlation module to compute the visibility function samples.

But this is a challenging topic due to the diversity of food, and color, light, view angles' effect on food image. Based on empirical and experimental explorations, we propose to use SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and Gabor descriptors as food image features and KMeans algorithm for feature clustering. We also propose to use pervasive cloud computing paradigm to improve the performance of food image recognition due to the heavy computing requirement for large number of concurrent recognition requests. Evaluations show that the proposed approach can give acceptable recognition rate, and MapReduce programming can provide promising performance advantage compared to traditional client server approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Green Computing and Communications and IEEE Internet of Things and IEEE Cyber, Physical and Social

Firstly, use a fixing length sliding window to split the target program system call sequences to create a short sequence pattern library. Then, use a pattern library to create a system call graph. Thirdly, use improved Page Rank algorithm to compute the weights between adjacent two nodes.

This results in deviations from the original load balance study and Power Management System (PMS) adjustments that were performed during shop tests, as Diesel Generators (D/Gs) often operate in parallel at low load far from their best efficiency points. In this paper, an integrated process control scheme is proposed in order to improve power balance in the vessel's air ventilation and central water cooling systems, involving the variable frequency control of Engine Room (E/R) Fans and Cooling Sea Water Pumps (C.S.W P/Ps). Experimental results derived from system retrofit application to a typical 105,000 DWT Aframax tanker vessel verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme towards achieving significant energy savings, which are in accordance with the theoretical results obtained from the air and heat balance studies. Power balance improvement leads not only to fuel savings but also to the use of only one D/G while sea going. Power quality measurements show compliance with relevant marine harmonic standards.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2013.6682477","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679331/6682441/06682477.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2013.6682477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of an integrated energy efficiency control system for ship power balance and diesel generator fuel consumption optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Development of an integrated energy efficiency control system for ship power balance and diesel generator fuel consumption optimization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682477/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970934","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682477/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an integrated energy efficiency control system for ship power balance and diesel generator fuel consumption optimization","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2013ESC223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106016S","chronDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679331","isNumber":"6682441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679331","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6682441","articleId":"6682477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6682478,"authors":[{"name":"Hsueh-Hsien Chang","affiliation":["Jin Wen University of Science and Technology, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsueh-Hsien","lastName":"Chang","id":"37406779700"},{"name":"Kuo-Lung Lian","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuo-Lung Lian","id":"37541893500"},{"name":"Yi-Ching Su","affiliation":["Chicony Electronics Co.

The proposed modulator can control the FC voltage to follow the requested reference value and simultaneously generate the required ac output voltage regardless of the values of the dc capacitor voltages of the converter. By implementing this method, smaller values of dc-link and flying capacitors can be used even in applications that could experience ripple or transient in the capacitors voltage. In the grid-connected single-phase five-level ANPC, where the capacitors can experience pulsation power and dc-link balancing issues, the selection of the reference voltage value for the FC can play an important role to balance the average values of the dc-link capacitors voltage. The proposed new control strategy uses a new reference voltage for the FC to be applied by the new modulator to have an average balanced dc-link voltages as well as an ac output voltage with good power quality. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modulation technique and control strategy even with using relatively small dc capacitors to produce high quality output voltage and current and maintaining an average balanced dc-link voltages.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Capacitors","Robustness","Artificial intelligence","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","power supply quality","power system transients","PWM power convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unbalanced DC voltage","single-phase grid connected PV system","grid-connected photovoltaic system","single-phase five-level flying capacitor","active-neutral-point-clamped converter","FC voltage control","dc capacitor voltage","grid-connected single-phase five-level ANPC converter","pulsation power","dc-link balancing issue","modulator","power quality","pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active-neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter","flying capacitor","multilevel converters","photovoltaic (PV) power system","pulse width modulation","voltage balancing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.2013.6682502","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679331/6682441/06682502.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2013.6682502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel modulation and control strategy for five-level ANPC converter with unbalanced DC voltage applied to a single-phase grid connected PV system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel modulation and control strategy for five-level ANPC converter with unbalanced DC voltage applied to a single-phase grid connected PV system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682502/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682502/","accessionNumber":"13970844","conferenceDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel modulation and control strategy for five-level ANPC converter with unbalanced DC voltage applied to a single-phase grid connected PV system","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2013IACC292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076755S","chronDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679331","isNumber":"6682441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679331","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6682441","articleId":"6682502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6682508,"authors":[{"name":"Bhim Singh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, I.

The RBF based control algorithm is used for extraction of fundamental weighted value of active and reactive power components of load currents for estimation of reference supply currents. A prototype of DSTATCOM is developed using a DSP (Digital Signal Processor). Test results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of DSTATCOM with proposed control algorithm for compensation of nonlinear loads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13970969","htmlLink":"/document/6682510/","conferenceDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of DSTATCOM using Neural Network Based Radial Basis Function","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of DSTATCOM using Neural Network Based Radial Basis Function","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2013IACC308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076413S","chronDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679331","isNumber":"6682441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679331","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6682441","articleId":"6682510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6682546,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-An Cheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Chun-An Cheng","id":"37334924800"},{"name":"Hung-Liang Cheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Hung-Liang Cheng","id":"37406116300"},{"name":"Tsung-Yuan Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Tsung-Yuan Chung","id":"38523248800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5202-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5201-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"6682546","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":723},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Switches","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","bridge circuits","coupled circuits","DC-DC power convertors","driver circuits","harmonic distortion","inductors","LED lamps","network topology","power factor correction","rectifying circuits","street lighting","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power factor correction","LED street lighting driver","coupled inductor","dual buck-boost converter subcircuit design","AC-DC converter","half-bridge-type LLC DC-DC resonant converter","conversion circuit topology","PFC","discontinuous-conduction mode","DCM","soft switching","power switches","rectifier diode","switching loss reduction","total harmonic distortion","LED lamp","THD","voltage 110 V","power 144 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Converter","LED","LLC resonant converter","power-factor-correction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682546","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2013.6682546","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","abstract":"This paper proposes a single-stage high-powerfactor LED driver with coupled inductors for street-lighting applications.

The coupled inductors inside the dual buck-boost converter sub-circuit are designed to be operated in discontinuous-conduction mode (DCM) for obtaining high power factor. The half-bridge-type LLC resonant converter is designed for achieving soft-switching on two power switches and output rectifier diodes in order to reduce their switching losses. The proposed driver features cost-effectiveness, low input current total-harmonic-distortion (THD<;10%), high power factor (>0.99) and reduced components counts. Finally, a prototype driver for powering a 144W-rated LED lamp with an 110V utility-line input voltage is developed, and satisfying experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed LED circuit.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2013.6682546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682441","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679331/6682441/06682546.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel single-stage high-power-factor LED street-lighting driver with coupled inductors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682546/","displayDocTitle":"A novel single-stage high-power-factor LED street-lighting driver with coupled inductors","conferenceDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970936","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel single-stage high-power-factor LED street-lighting driver with coupled inductors","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2013ILDC441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054084S","chronDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679331","isNumber":"6682441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679331","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6682441","articleId":"6682546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6682547,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Traditional protection schemes and algorithms need to be extensively investigated as more and more DGs get introduced into the network. The current version of IEEE Std 1547 does not present a comprehensive solution for fault current detection in the presence of various kinds of DGs. Power electronic inverter-based DGs are of special concern in distribution network protection as they are often incapable of providing sufficient fault current and their controllers play a principal role in the DG behavior. In this paper, the effects of voltage and current controllers for inverter-based DGs on industrial and commercial power system distribution network protection schemes are investigated. It is shown that the type of controller and its design parameters during the fault have a direct impact on fault current levels and duration. A simplified distribution network model with inverter-based DG operating under voltage and current control modes was tested to verify the effects of these controllers. This paper also proposes an adaptive relaying algorithm to detect the faults in the presence of inverter-based DGs with various types of controllers.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2013.6682617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682441","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679331/6682441/06682617.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The influence of inverter-based DGs and their controllers on distribution network protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682617/","displayDocTitle":"The influence of inverter-based DGs and their controllers on distribution network protection","conferenceDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970903","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The influence of inverter-based DGs and their controllers on distribution network protection","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"2013PSPC397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067009S","chronDate":"6-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679331","isNumber":"6682441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679331","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6682441","articleId":"6682617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6682626,"authors":[{"name":"Wonseok Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Wonseok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085676788"},{"name":"Moon-Gun Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Moon-Gun","lastName":"Song","id":"37596735500"},{"name":"Jaeha Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeha","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37086624179"},{"name":"Gi-Hong Im","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Gi-Hong","lastName":"Im","id":"37265558500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6682626","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1009},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Diversity reception","Approximation methods","Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","fading channels","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","fast-fading channels","soft combining methods","cognitive radio networks","fast-fading environment","probability distribution","mixture of gamma approximation","Neyman-Pearson criterion","MoG distribution","central limit theorem","equal gain combining","SNR weighted combining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","energy detection","cooperative spectrum sensing","soft combining","mixture of gamma","Neyman\u2014Pearson criterion"]}],"abstract":"We propose soft combining methods for cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks over fast-fading channels. In fast-fading environment, it is difficult to obtain the exact probability distribution of the total received energy during an observation period. Therefore, we apply the mixture of gamma (MoG) approximation to obtain the distribution function of the total received energy. By exploiting the approximated distribution, we derive a soft combining method that reduces the probability of missed detection for a given probability of false alarm based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion. In addition, we propose a simplified soft combining method by using the dominant component of the MoG distribution. Simulation results show that the proposed combining methods outperform the conventional methods based on the central limit theorem, the equal gain combining, and the SNR weighted combining.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.112713.131767","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6747950/06682626.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.112713.131767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Combining for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Fast-Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Soft Combining for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Fast-Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682626/","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6682626/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128315","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Combining for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Fast-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"193-cl1402-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05143S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6747950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6747950","articleId":"6682626","onlineDate":"11 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6682628,"authors":[{"name":"Vitalio Alfonso Reguera","affiliation":["Central University of Las Villas, Santa Clara, Cuba"],"firstName":"Vitalio Alfonso","lastName":"Reguera","id":"37680953800"},{"name":"Erik Ortiz Guerra","affiliation":["Central University of Las Villas, Santa Clara, Cuba"],"firstName":"Erik Ortiz","lastName":"Guerra","id":"37086073533"},{"name":"Richard Demo Souza","affiliation":["Federal University of Technology, Curitiba, PR, Brazil"],"firstName":"Richard Demo","lastName":"Souza","id":"37275937500"},{"name":"Evelio M.

With the random vector quantization (RVQ) feedback scheme, only the channel direction information (CDI) is quantized and fed back to the transmitter. Applying the THP directly at the transmitter will cause unavoidable interference at the destination due to the quantization error. We herein design a robust THP with the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion by taking the quantization error into account to mitigate the effect of the quantization error.

However, this is vulnerable to sensing data falsification attacks due to the distributed nature of cooperative spectrum sensing. To overcome this problem, we introduce a primary user emulation test (PUET), under which a trustful central entity (e.g., a cellular base station) transmits a test signal while other users are sensing the spectrum. The core of PUET is to correlate the reported sensing data with the transmission power of the test signal. Since this test signal is, in reality, an interference to the sensing of a primary signal, sensors cannot distinguish the test signal from the primary signal. Considering this characteristic of sensors, PUET detects attacks by evaluating the consistency of channel parameters, which are not known to sensors. By recognizing this defense mechanism, PUET checks the validity of reports from each sensor separately. The efficacy of PUET is validated via experimentation on a testbed deployed in an indoor environment. Our measurement study shows that PUET achieves over 95% detection rate while keeping the false alarm rate under 5%.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2013.6682688","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675898/6682673/06682688.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2013.6682688","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","startPage":"19","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks using interference signatures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Secure cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks using interference signatures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682688/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682688/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970740","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks using interference signatures","confLoc":"National Harbor, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p19choi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061211S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675898","isNumber":"6682673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675898","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6682673","articleId":"6682688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6682689,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjune Gwon","affiliation":["Harvard University"],"firstName":"Youngjune","lastName":"Gwon","id":"37276688800"},{"name":"Siamak Dastangoo","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Siamak","lastName":"Dastangoo","id":"37085675854"},{"name":"Carl Fossa","affiliation":["MIT Lincoln Laboratory"],"firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Fossa","id":"37278981400"},{"name":"H.

In this paper, we design a novel, non-intrusive moving-target defense system, NOMAD, to complement existing solutions. NOMAD prevents web bots from automating web resource access by randomizing HTML elements while not affecting normal users. Specifically, to prevent web bots uniquely identifying HTML elements for later automation, NOMAD randomizes name/id parameter values of HTML elements in each HTTP form page. We evaluate NOMAD against five powerful state-of-the-art web bots on several popular open source web platforms. According to our evaluation, NOMAD can prevent all these web bots with a relatively low overhead.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2013.6682692","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675898/6682673/06682692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2013.6682692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682673","startPage":"55","endPage":"63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMAD: Towards non-intrusive moving-target defense against web bots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NOMAD: Towards non-intrusive moving-target defense against web bots","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682692/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970773","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682692/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOMAD: Towards non-intrusive moving-target defense against web bots","confLoc":"National Harbor, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p55vikram.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072293S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675898","isNumber":"6682673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675898","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6682673","articleId":"6682692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6682701,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085519991"},{"name":"Baochun Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Baochun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085349451"},{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Fenghua Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fenghua","lastName":"Li","id":"38562655000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0895-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6682701","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":795},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public key","Artificial intelligence","Forgery","Games","Equations","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data integrity","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud","security threats","data integrity auditing","public key infrastructure","PKI","certificates","certificate management","certificateless public auditing mechanism","public verifier","data integrity verification"]}],"abstract":"Due to the existence of security threats in the cloud, many mechanisms have been proposed to allow a user to audit data integrity with the public key of the data owner before utilizing cloud data. The correctness of choosing the right public key in previous mechanisms depends on the security of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificates. Although traditional PKI has been widely used in the construction of public key cryptography, it still faces many security risks, especially in the aspect of managing certificates. In this paper, we design a certificateless public auditing mechanism to eliminate the security risks introduced by PKI in previous solutions. Specifically, with our mechanism, a public verifier does not need to manage certificates to choose the right public key for the auditing. Instead, the auditing can be operated with the assistance of the data owner's identity, such as her name or email address, which can ensure the right public key is used. Meanwhile, this public verifier is still able to audit data integrity without retrieving the entire data from the cloud as previous solutions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first certificateless public auditing mechanism for verifying data integrity in the cloud. Our theoretical analyses prove that our mechanism is correct and secure, and our experimental results show that our mechanism is able to audit the integrity of data in the cloud efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2013.6682701","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675898/6682673/06682701.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2013.6682701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682673","startPage":"136","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Certificateless public auditing for data integrity in the cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Certificateless public auditing for data integrity in the cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682701/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970733","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682701/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Certificateless public auditing for data integrity in the cloud","confLoc":"National Harbor, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p136wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072246S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675898","isNumber":"6682673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675898","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6682673","articleId":"6682701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":6682708,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya Sowti Khiabani","affiliation":["Seagate Korea Design Center, Suwon-city, Korea"],"firstName":"Yahya Sowti","lastName":"Khiabani","id":"38234620900"},{"name":"Shuangqing Wei","affiliation":["Seagate Korea Design Center, Suwon-city, Korea"],"firstName":"Shuangqing","lastName":"Wei","id":"37291360200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0895-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6682708","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682708","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Ciphers","Random variables","Privacy","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","entropy","optimisation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential secrecy","unbounded adversary","encryption","privacy amplification","communication channel","adversary resources","common key source","key extractor","R\u00e9nyi extractor","cipher","inverse universal hashing","message transmission","exponent analysis","optimization","information leakage","entropy","error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["universal2 hash functions","L1 norm distance","randomness extractor","R\u00e9nyi entropy","secrecy exponent","equivocation","unbounded adversary","end-to-end secrecy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper without tailoring to any presumed condition on communication channel or any restriction on adversary's resources we design a secrecy scheme with information leakage that decays at an exponential rate.

We analytically evaluate the outage-free secrecy capacity - the maximal data rate that guarantees perfect security within a class of channel realizations. Using analysis and simulations, we evaluate the impact of key system parameters on the secrecy capacity of SDM systems.

GTID exploits the heterogeneity of devices, which is a function of different device hardware compositions and variations in devices' clock skew. We use statistical techniques to create unique, reproducible device and device type signatures that represent time variant behavior in network traffic and use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify devices and device types. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on both an isolated testbed and a live campus network (during peak hours) using a corpus of 27 devices representing a wide range of device classes. We collected more than 100 GB of traffic captures for ANN training and classification. We assert that for any fingerprinting technique to be practical, it must be able to detect previously unseen devices (i.e., devices for which no stored signature is available) and must be able to withstand various attacks. GTID is the first fingerprinting technique to detect previously unseen devices and to illustrate its resilience under various attacker models. We measure the performance of GTID by considering accuracy, recall, and processing time and illustrate how it can be used to complement existing authentication systems and to detect counterfeit devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682720/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970734","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A passive technique for fingerprinting wireless devices with Wired-side Observations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A passive technique for fingerprinting wireless devices with Wired-side Observations","confLoc":"National Harbor, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p305uluagac.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052148S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675898","isNumber":"6682673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675898","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6682673","articleId":"6682720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6682725,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Callegari","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Callegari","id":"37542316200"},{"name":"Alessandro Casella","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Casella","id":"37086772823"},{"name":"Stefano Giordano","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Giordano","id":"37269710800"},{"name":"Michele Pagano","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Pagano","id":"37287806000"},{"name":"Teresa Pepe","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Italy, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Pepe"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0895-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6682725","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"abstract":"The diffusion of technologies for high speed data transmission over the Internet and the growing employment of new multimedia services require fast and effective techniques for the protection against network attacks.

As the power information integrates into Internet, it raises a challenge on security which threats the power system. To ensure the security of sensitive clouding data of electric power system, the straightforward approach is to encrypt such sensitive data. However, traditional cryptographic methods will cause the cipher-text difficult to be efficiently queried. Particularly, it becomes more difficult to deploy such scheme for mobile devices in smart grid, considering that they are usually computation-limited and storage-limited. In this paper, based on the existing schemes for searchable encryption on clouding database, we proposed an efficient, secure, and scalable scheme to address this challenge issue.

To conduct the cyber security situation awareness, a large volume of data streams from monitored devices needs to be efficiently stored and processed in real time. In this paper, we propose a cloud computing based architecture for conducting cyber security situation awareness. Particularly, we leverage the cloud infrastructure with a cost-effective data storage and investigate efficient stream processing techniques to reduce operational delays. To effectively detect threats, we present a parallel cloud based threat detection that integrates both signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection. To capture the insightful characteristics of attacks, we discuss the attack scene analysis based on spatiotemporal correlation and visualization schemes to analyze, trace, and visualize abnormal behaviors. Lastly, we present the testbed setup and the implementation workflow to validate the effectiveness of our proposed system.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675898/6682673/06682765.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cloud computing based architecture for cyber security situation awareness","doi":"10.1109/CNS.2013.6682765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS.2013.6682765","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A cloud computing based architecture for cyber security situation awareness","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13970743","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6682765/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cloud computing based architecture for cyber security situation awareness","confLoc":"National Harbor, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"p488yu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062779S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675898","isNumber":"6682673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675898","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6682673","articleId":"6682765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6682779,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge E.

First we applied a gain-scheduling PI control strategy, allowing a good control performance regardless of the system operating region.

This CAD tool optimizes three structures of Cross-Coupled LC voltage controlled oscillator (LC VCOs) (i.e. CMOS alone, NMOS alone, PMOS alone VCOs) for 2.4GHz central frequency based on IEEE 802.11 in a commercial 0.18um RF CMOS technology, simultaneously. Parasitic aware RF CAD tool casts RF circuit synthesis as weighted multi-objective optimization quandary.

In this paper, we consider a smart attacker which performs its own spectrum sensing and according to its acquired knowledge about the presence or absent of the primary signal, it optimizes the detection performance in an efficient and implementable way.

In each combination scheme, the problem was the sensor selection so that the energy consumption was minimized while detection performance was satisfied. The problem was solved based on the standard convex optimization method.

Secure localization in WSNs needs to detect malicious nodes and exclude them in order to avoid deception by attackers. Accurate and appropriate methods that are usually iterative algorithms such as gradient descent, least median square (LMdS) and voting based secure localization have been introduced in the recent literature. Gradient descent based secure localization has better performance in terms of convergence speed and accuracy while have the minimum complexity compared to the other methods, however, still more convergence speed is needed for real-time applications. In this paper, a new gradient based method has been introduced which has higher convergence speed among all existing algorithms and the probability of fault for this algorithm is less than other algorithms. The other advantage of the proposed method is its low complexity in comparison to the other methods and its capability to be implemented in hardware. Simulation results show that the introduced algorithm's convergence speed is about 10 times more than the gradient descent algorithm with same localization error.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2013-Nov. 1 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682841/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13973953","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682841/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A low complexity and high speed gradient descent based secure localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity and high speed gradient descent based secure localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICCKE2013PC278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047177S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678914","isNumber":"6682797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678914","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6682797","articleId":"6682841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6682845,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sabokrou","affiliation":["Dept. of ICT, MalekAshtar University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Sabokrou","id":"38234848300"},{"name":"Mahmood Fathy","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Fathy","id":"37266676300"},{"name":"Mojtaba Hosseini","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Hosseini","id":"38241470900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2093-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2092-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6682845","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Accuracy","Wireless sensor networks","Visualization","Educational institutions","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","neural nets","target tracking","telecommunication computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile target tracking","non-overlapping wireless visual sensor networks","neural networks","field-of-views","FOV","NN","prediction based method","sensor selection","WVSN cost configuration","energy conservation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Target Tracking","Wireless visual Sensor Networks","Non-overlapping coverage","energy consumption","Accuracy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682845","abstract":"Target tracking using Wireless Visual Sensors Networks (WVSN), is an interesting research area, especially if visual sensors have non-overlapping Field-Of-Views (FOV).

Recently, with the rapid growth of data centers in terms of both size and number, the power consumption has become a major challenge for both industry and society. At the software level, energy-aware task scheduling is an effective technique for power reduction in the data centers. However, most of the currently proposed energy-aware scheduling approaches are only paying attention to computation cost. In the other words, they ignore the energy consumed by the network equipment, namely communication cost. In this paper, the problem of scheduling precedence-constrained parallel tasks of network-intensive applications on homogeneous physical machines in the data centers is addressed. The proposed Energy-Aware Scheduling algorithm (EASy) takes both the computation cost and communication cost into consideration with a low time complexity O(nlogn+2((e+n)mv)). The algorithm reduces energy consumption of the computation and communication by dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) and task packing respectively. The goal of EASy is to minimize the completion time besides energy consumption of the data center. The extensive experimental results using both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications clearly demonstrate that EASy is capable of decreasing energy consumption of physical machines and network devices respectively by 4.5% and 15.06% on average.","doi":"10.1109/ICCKE.2013.6682850","publicationTitle":"ICCKE 2013","displayPublicationTitle":"ICCKE 2013","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678914/6682797/06682850.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCKE.2013.6682850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-aware scheduling algorithm for precedence-constrained parallel tasks of network-intensive applications in a distributed homogeneous environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2013-Nov. 1 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware scheduling algorithm for precedence-constrained parallel tasks of network-intensive applications in a distributed homogeneous environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974004","htmlLink":"/document/6682850/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware scheduling algorithm for precedence-constrained parallel tasks of network-intensive applications in a distributed homogeneous environment","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICCKE2013PC308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095283S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678914","isNumber":"6682797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678914","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6682797","articleId":"6682850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6682893,"authors":[{"name":"Dian Gong","affiliation":["Institute for Robotics and Intelligence Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6840869/6682893/gong-244-small.gif","p":["Dian Gong received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree major in electrical engineering and minor in computer science from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Human motion sequences are represented by multivariate time series in the joint-trajectories space. Under this structured time series framework, we first propose Kernelized Temporal Cut (KTC), an extension of previous works on change-point detection by incorporating Hilbert space embedding of distributions, to handle the nonparametric and high dimensionality issues of human motions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields realtime segmentation, and produces high action segmentation accuracy. Second, a spatio-temporal manifold framework is proposed to model the latent structure of time series data. Then an efficient spatio-temporal alignment algorithm Dynamic Manifold Warping (DMW) is proposed for multivariate time series to calculate motion similarity between action sequences (segments). Furthermore, by combining the temporal segmentation algorithm and the alignment algorithm, online human action recognition can be performed by associating a few labeled examples from motion capture data. The results on human motion capture data and 3D depth sensor data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically segmenting and recognizing motion sequences, and its ability to handle noisy and partially occluded data, in the transfer learning module.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.244","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6840869/06682893.pdf","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6840869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured Time Series Analysis for Human Action Segmentation and Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Structured Time Series Analysis for Human Action Segmentation and Recognition","volume":"36","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14397028","pubMedId":"26353312","publicationDate":"July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6682893/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured Time Series Analysis for Human Action Segmentation and Recognition","sourcePdf":"tpami-gong-244-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119616S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6840869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6840869","articleId":"6682893","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6682899,"authors":[{"name":"Catalin Ionescu","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6840869/6682899/iones-248-small.gif","p":["Catalin Ionescu is a PhD candidate at the University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

Besides increasing the size of the datasets in the current state-of-the-art by several orders of magnitude, we also aim to complement such datasets with a diverse set of motions and poses encountered as part of typical human activities (taking photos, talking on the phone, posing, greeting, eating, etc.), with additional synchronized image, human motion capture, and time of flight (depth) data, and with accurate 3D body scans of all the subject actors involved. We also provide controlled mixed reality evaluation scenarios where 3D human models are animated using motion capture and inserted using correct 3D geometry, in complex real environments, viewed with moving cameras, and under occlusion. Finally, we provide a set of large-scale statistical models and detailed evaluation baselines for the dataset illustrating its diversity and the scope for improvement by future work in the research community. Our experiments show that our best large-scale model can leverage our full training set to obtain a 20% improvement in performance compared to a training set of the scale of the largest existing public dataset for this problem. Yet the potential for improvement by leveraging higher capacity, more complex models with our large dataset, is substantially vaster and should stimulate future research.

In this paper, we demonstrate that motion will be exploited most effectively, if it is regarded over larger time windows. Opposed to classical two-frame optical flow, point trajectories that span hundreds of frames are less susceptible to short-term variations that hinder separating different objects. As a positive side effect, the resulting groupings are temporally consistent over a whole video shot, a property that requires tedious post-processing in the vast majority of existing approaches. We suggest working with a paradigm that starts with semi-dense motion cues first and that fills up textureless areas afterwards based on color. This paper also contributes the Freiburg-Berkeley motion segmentation (FBMS) dataset, a large, heterogeneous benchmark with 59 sequences and pixel-accurate ground truth annotation of moving objects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation of Moving Objects by Long Term Video Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.242","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6822661/06682905.pdf","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6822661","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of Moving Objects by Long Term Video Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6682905/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331987","pubMedId":"26353280","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of Moving Objects by Long Term Video Analysis","sourcePdf":"tpami-ochs-242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15116S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6822661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"6822661","articleId":"6682905","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6682909,"authors":[{"name":"Xuebo Song","affiliation":["School of Computing Clemson University, SC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/6832661/6682909/6682909-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuebo Song received the BS degree in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China.

In this paper we propose a novel and efficient method to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. The proposed method addresses the limitations in existing GO term similarity measurement techniques; it computes the semantic content of a GO term by considering the information content of all of its ancestor terms in the graph. The aggregate information content (AIC) of all ancestor terms of a GO term implicitly reflects the GO term's location in the GO graph and also represents how human beings use this GO term and all its ancestor terms to annotate genes. We show that semantic similarity of GO terms obtained by our method closely matches the human perception. Extensive experimental studies show that this novel method also outperforms all existing methods in terms of the correlation with gene expression data. We have developed web services for measuring semantic similarity of GO terms and functional similarity of genes using the proposed AIC method and other popular methods.

We refer to this scheme as Residual Idle Time Distribution based Scheme (RIBS). In this scheme, the SU randomly senses the channel and if the channel is sensed idle, then it uses residual idle time distribution to estimate its transmission duration such that the probability of its interference with PU is below a predefined threshold. We derive analytical formulae for various performance metrics of SU and validate them through simulations. Simulation experiments are conducted for two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we use synthetically generated channel occupancy data due to PU transmissions using two standard distributions (2-phase Erlang and Uniform distribution). In the second scenario, we use data collected by simulating a TDMA-based PU network that runs realistic applications (VoIP and Web browsing). A pair of sender and receiver SU uses RIBS to opportunistically transmit on the channel. Our simulation experiments show that SU can use RIBS to opportunistically transmit on the channel without violating the interference probability constraint. We also list some of the challenges in using RIBS in realistic scenarios, and provide a comprehensive methodology to use RIBS in such scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","volume":"13","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"14400879","publicationDate":"July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6682911/","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Model Based Opportunistic Channel Access in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Model Based Opportunistic Channel Access in Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-sharma-157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078972S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6845393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6845393","articleId":"6682911","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6682924,"authors":[{"name":"Denny Vrandecic","firstName":"Denny","lastName":"Vrandecic"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-1672"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-1294"}],"articleNumber":"6682924","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":642},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wikipedia","Knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deductive databases","groupware","public domain software","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wikidata","Wikipedia","knowledge base","fact collection","Wikimedia Foundation","free secondary database","collaborative secondary database","multilingual secondary database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wikipedia","Wikidata","knowledge base","intelligent systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682924","abstract":"Wikipedia was recently enhanced by a knowledge base: Wikidata.

Then the frequency-splitting phenomenon is displayed and further explained mathematically and physically. An important factor for frequency splitting is introduced. The boundary condition for frequency splitting and its splitting frequency points are deduced. The amplitude-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics of the input impedance are measured and described to verify the explanation. Three related factors are studied, and the sensitivity analysis is conducted. A solution is proposed that helps improve the efficiency when frequency splitting occurs.

Compressed sensing (CS) theory has been applied to improve the imaging speed and thus the spatiotemporal resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that employs a patch-based 3-D spatiotemporal dictionary for sparse representations of dynamic image sequence in the CS framework. Specifically, the dynamic image sequence is divided into overlapping patches along both the spatial and temporal directions. The dictionary is used to provide flexible sparse expressions for these patches. The underlying optimization problem is solved by variable splitting and the alternating direction method with multiplier. Experimental results based on in vivo cardiac data demonstrate that the proposed method is able to accelerate cardiac cine imaging by a factor up to 8 and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CS methods at high accelerations. The method is expected to be useful in dynamic imaging with a higher spatiotemporal resolution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6774470/06682996.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2294939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2294939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6682996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Using Learned Spatiotemporal Dictionary","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Transforms","Image reconstruction","Three-dimensional displays","Magnetic resonance imaging","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cardiology","cinematography","compressed sensing","image representation","image resolution","image sequences","medical image processing","optimisation","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","dynamic cardiac cine MRI","magnetic resonance imaging","learned spatiotemporal dictionary","spatiotemporal resolution","low imaging speed","sparse representations","dynamic image sequence","overlapping patches","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating direction method with multiplier (ADMM)","dynamic cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","spatiotemporal dictionary"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Heart","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine","Reproducibility of Results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6682996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Using Learned Spatiotemporal Dictionary","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14180269","pubMedId":"24658236","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Using Learned Spatiotemporal Dictionary","sourcePdf":"tbme-ying-2294939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097575S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6774470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"65","articleId":"6682996","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6682997,"authors":[{"name":"Boram Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6949178/6682997/6682997-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Boram Han was born in Incheon, in 1988.

We first consider the problem of finding the input sequences that minimize a given cost function over a finite time horizon. The problem solution is obtained by means of a recursive algorithm that represents the analogue for BCNs of the difference Riccati equation for linear systems. We prove that a significant number of optimal control problems for BCNs can be easily reframed into the present setup. In particular, the cost function can be adjusted so as to include penalties on the switchings, provided that we augment the size of the BCN state variable. In the second part of the paper, we address the infinite horizon optimal control problem and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem solvability. The solution is obtained as the limit of the solution over the finite horizon [0,T], and it is always achieved in a finite number of steps.

In the past, various transformerless PV inverter topologies have been introduced, with leakage current minimized by the means of galvanic isolation and common-mode voltage (CMV) clamping. The galvanic isolation can be achieved via dc-decoupling or ac-decoupling, for isolation on the dc- or ac-side of the inverter, respectively. It has been shown that the latter provides lower losses due to the reduced switch count in conduction path. Nevertheless, leakage current cannot be simply eliminated by galvanic isolation and modulation techniques, due to the presence of switches' junction capacitances and resonant circuit effects. Hence, CMV clamping is used in some topologies to completely eliminate the leakage current. In this paper, several recently proposed transformerless PV inverters with different galvanic isolation methods and CMV clamping technique are analyzed and compared. A simple modified H-bridge zero-voltage state rectifier is also proposed, to combine the benefits of the low-loss ac-decoupling method and the complete leakage current elimination of the CMV clamping method. The performances of different topologies, in terms of CMV, leakage current, total harmonic distortion, losses and efficiencies are compared. The analyses are done theoretically and via simulation studies, and further validated with experimental results. This paper is helpful for the researchers to choose the appropriate topology for transformerless PV applications and to provide the design principles in terms of common-mode behavior and efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Leakage currents","Inverters","Clamps","Switches","Capacitance","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","invertors","leakage currents","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common-mode efficiency","common-mode behavior","harmonic distortion","leakage current","CMV clamping method","ac-decoupling method","H-bridge zero-voltage state rectifier","CMV clamping technique","galvanic isolation methods","resonant circuit effects","junction capacitances","modulation techniques","ac-decoupling","dc-decoupling","common-mode voltage clamping","transformerless PV inverter topologies","transformerless photovoltaic inverters","leakage current minimization","single-phase transformerless grid-connected PV inverters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common-mode voltage (CMV)","leakage current","photovoltaic (PV) system","transformerless"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2294953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6824280/06683013.pdf","startPage":"5358","endPage":"5369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2294953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison and Analysis of Single-Phase Transformerless Grid-Connected PV Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison and Analysis of Single-Phase Transformerless Grid-Connected PV Inverters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683013/","volume":"29","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6683013/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14362397","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison and Analysis of Single-Phase Transformerless Grid-Connected PV Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-freddytan-2294953-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130856S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6824280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"6824280","articleId":"6683013","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6683016,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Subramanyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/6824880/6683016/subra-2294918-small.gif","p":["Pramod Subramanyan is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University.

Our techniques require no manual intervention and experiments show that they determine the functionality of >45% and up to 93% of the gates in each of the test circuits that we examine. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are scalable to real designs by experimenting with a very large, highly-optimized system-on-chip (SOC) design with over 375000 combinational elements. Our inference algorithms cover 68% of the gates in this SOC. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are effective in aiding a human analyst to detect hardware Trojans in an unstructured netlist.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2013.2294918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2013.2294918","startPage":"63","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/6824880/06683016.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse Engineering Digital Circuits Using Structural and Functional Analyses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Reverse Engineering Digital Circuits Using Structural and Functional Analyses","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349367","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6683016/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reverse Engineering Digital Circuits Using Structural and Functional Analyses","sourcePdf":"tetc-subramanyan-2294918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129281S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"6824880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6824880","articleId":"6683016","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6683022,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Shao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6828828/6683022/shao-2293418-small.gif","p":["Ling Shao (M'09\u2013SM'10) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, the M.Sc. degree in medical image analysis, and the Ph.D. degree in computer vision from the University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K.","He is currently a Senior Lecturer with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., and is a Guest Professor with the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China.

Most existing image classification methods use hand-crafted features, which are not adaptive for different image domains. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary learning methodology to automatically generate domain-adaptive global feature descriptors for image classification using multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP). In our architecture, a set of primitive 2-D operators are randomly combined to construct feature descriptors through the MOGP evolving and then evaluated by two objective fitness criteria, i.e., the classification error and the tree complexity. After the entire evolution procedure finishes, the best-so-far solution selected by the MOGP is regarded as the (near-)optimal feature descriptor obtained. To evaluate its performance, the proposed approach is systematically tested on the Caltech-101, the MIT urban and nature scene, the CMU PIE, and Jochen Triesch Static Hand Posture II data sets, respectively. Experimental results verify that our method significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art hand-designed features and two feature learning techniques in terms of classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","volume":"25","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14396603","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6683022/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feature Learning for Image Classification Via Multiobjective Genetic Programming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000858","fundingName":"University of Sheffield"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106 and 91120302"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Learning for Image Classification Via Multiobjective Genetic Programming","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2293418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137054S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6828828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"6828828","articleId":"6683022","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6683025,"authors":[{"name":"Shuzhi Sam Ge","affiliation":["Social Robotics Lab, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shuzhi Sam","lastName":"Ge","id":"37275647400"},{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["The Key Lab of Autonomous System and Network Control, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Li","id":"37086634202"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6683025","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1928},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Vectors","Adaptive control","Lyapunov methods","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","robust control","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive control","MIMO nonlinear systems","high dimensional integral Lyapunov functions","nonlinearities","adaptive state feedback control","high-gain observer","adaptive output feedback control","MIMO plant stabilization","closed-loop stability","tracking error convergence","design parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","integral Lyapunov","MIMO plant","state and output feedback"]}],"abstract":"In this technical note, high dimensional integral Lyapunov functions are introduced for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems with unknown nonlinearities. First, adaptive state feedback control is presented based on the integral Lyapunov function. When only the output is measurable, by using a high-gain observer to estimate the derivative of the system output, adaptive output feedback control is also derived. The proposed control scheme provides a general approach to stabilize the MIMO plant without any restrictive assumptions. The control is continuous and ensures closed-loop stability and convergence of the tracking error to a small residual set. The size of the tracking error at steady state can be specified a priori and guaranteed by choosing the design parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Control for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems by State and Output Feedback","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2013.2294826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6819104/06683025.pdf","startPage":"1624","endPage":"1629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2013.2294826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Control for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems by State and Output Feedback","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6683025/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14318963","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174045 and 61228301"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Control for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems by State and Output Feedback","sourcePdf":"tac-ge-2294826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11538S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6819104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6819104","articleId":"6683025","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6683027,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Yaramasu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/6728629/6683027/6683027-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Venkata Yaramasu (S'08) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2005, and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from the S.

The dc-link capacitor voltages are balanced by the boost converter, and thus the control complexity for the grid-tied inverter is greatly simplified.

The experiments were conducted on five able-bodied subjects and five patients with tetraplegia using electroencephalography signals from six channels, and different time-windows of data were examined to find the highest accuracy. For practical purposes, the best two channel combinations were chosen and presented. The three relevant mental tasks used for the BCI were letter composing, arithmetic, and Rubik's cube rolling forward, and these are associated with three wheelchair commands: left, right, and forward, respectively. An additional eyes closed task was collected for testing and used for on-off commands. The results show a dominant alpha wave during eyes closure with average classification accuracy above 90%. The accuracies for patients with tetraplegia were lower compared to the able-bodied subjects; however, this was improved by increasing the duration of the time-windows. The FPSOCM-ANN provides improved accuracies compared to genetic algorithm-based artificial neural network (GA-ANN) for three mental tasks-based BCI classifications with the best classification accuracy achieved for a 7-s time-window: 84.4% (FPSOCM-ANN) compared to 77.4% (GA-ANN). More comparisons on feature extractors and classifiers were included. For two-channel classification, the best two channels were O1 and C4, followed by second best at P3 and O2, and third best at C3 and O2. Mental arithmetic was the most correctly classified task, followed by mental Rubik's cube rolling forward and mental letter composing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564324","pubMedId":"25192573","htmlLink":"/document/6683068/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Brain\u2013Computer Interface Classifier for Wheelchair Commands Using Neural Network With Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain\u2013Computer Interface Classifier for Wheelchair Commands Using Neural Network With Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"jbhi-chai-2295006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119145S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6889048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6889048","articleId":"6683068","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6683072,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Gao","affiliation":["University of Technology of Belfort-Montbeliard, Belfort, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/6740871/6683072/6683072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Gao (S\u201909\u2013M\u201910) received the Master's degree in electrical and control system engineering and the Ph.D. degree in renewable energy with an university youth doctor reward, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, from the University of Technology of Belfort-Montbeliard (UTBM), Belfort, France.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Energy and Environment Department of the UTBM.

The successful integration requires an optimized flip-chip interconnect. The interconnect performance was optimized by modeling and characterizing the flip-chip transition on a low-loss liquid crystal polymer organic substrate. When the loss of coplanar waveguide (CPW) lines is included, an insertion loss of 0.6 dB per flip-chip-interconnect is measured. If the loss of CPW lines is de-embedded, 0.25 dB of insertion loss is observed. This kind of low-loss flip-chip interconnect is essential for good performance of W-band modules. The module, which we present in this paper, consists of an end-fire Yagi-Uda antenna integrated with an SiGe BiCMOS LNA. The module is 3 mm \u00d7 1.9 mm and consumes only 19.2 mW of dc power. We present passive and active E- and H-plane radiation pattern measurements at 87, 90, and 94 GHz. Passive and active antennas both showed a 10-dB bandwidth of 10 GHz. The peak gain of passive and active antennas was 5.2 dBi at 90 GHz and 21.2 dBi at 93 GHz, respectively. The measurements match well with the simulated results.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2292832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6701340/06683098.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2292832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701340","startPage":"64","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packaging a --Band Integrated Module With an Optimized Flip-Chip Interconnect on an Organic Substrate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Packaging a <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$W$</tex> </formula>-Band Integrated Module With an Optimized Flip-Chip Interconnect on an Organic Substrate","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998046","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6683098/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packaging a <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$W$</tex> </formula>-Band Integrated Module With an Optimized Flip-Chip Interconnect on an Organic Substrate","sourcePdf":"tmtt-khan-2292832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091681S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6701340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6701340","articleId":"6683098","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6683113,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Britton Chance Center for Biomedical Photonics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/6587779/6683113/6683113-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Wang received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2008.

Previous investigations demonstrated that alcohols are excellent optical clearing agents for in vitro skin because they have hydroxyl. However, sugars with hydroxyl groups have received little attention. Here, three sugars, fructose, glucose, and ribose, were investigated using a molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro experiments. The simulated results revealed that fructose and ribose have the highest and lowest optical clearing potential, respectively, according to their propensity to form hydrogen bonds and bridges. The resolutions through skin samples after 24 min of immersion in fructose, glucose, or ribose solutions were quantitatively calculated using a USAF target and reached 14.3 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcm, 27.3 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcm, and 39.6 \u00b1 4.1 \u03bcm, respectively, which are in accordance with the theoretical prediction. Unfortunately, topical fructose treatment of in vivo rat skin could not induce excellent optical clearing. Thus, a chemical penetration enhancer was used for in vivo studies. A comparison of laser speckle imaging of dermal blood flow after topical treatment with fructose, a penetration enhancer, and a mixture of the two to rat skin in vivo demonstrated that the mixture causes the largest increase in the resolution and contrast.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/6587779/06683113.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2013.2289966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2013.2289966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6587779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sugar-Induced Skin Optical Clearing: From Molecular Dynamics Simulation to Experimental Demonstration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skin","Sugar","Optical imaging","Adaptive optics","Bridges","Hydrogen","Speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biomedical optical imaging","haemodynamics","hydrogen bonds","laser applications in medicine","molecular dynamics method","skin","speckle","sugar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sugar-induced skin optical clearing","molecular dynamics simulation","tissue optical clearing technique","biomedical optical imaging","alcohols","hydroxyl groups","hydrogen bonds","hydrogen bridges","fructose solutions","glucose solutions","ribose solutions","USAF target","in vivo rat skin","chemical penetration enhancer","laser speckle imaging","dermal blood flow","time 24 min"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Laser speckle contrast imaging","molecular dynamics (MD) simulation","skin optical clearing","sugars"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sugar-Induced Skin Optical Clearing: From Molecular Dynamics Simulation to Experimental Demonstration","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6683113/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2014","accessionNumber":"13968817","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","externalId":"7101007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sugar-Induced Skin Optical Clearing: From Molecular Dynamics Simulation to Experimental Demonstration","sourcePdf":"jstqe-zhu-2289966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140534S","chronDate":"March-April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6587779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6587779","articleId":"6683113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6683120,"authors":[{"name":"Aydin Behnad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Aydin","lastName":"Behnad","id":"37541917800"},{"name":"Xianbin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Xianbin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281394100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6683120","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Error probability","Signal to noise ratio","Approximation methods","Wireless communication","Harmonic analysis","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","approximation theory","fading channels","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic mean approximation","multihop amplify-and-forward relaying","end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio","fading model","multihop AF relaying systems","exact outage probability","symbol error probability","ergodic capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward","cooperative networks","fading channels","harmonic mean","multihop relaying"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683120","abstract":"The accuracy of the harmonic mean approximation (HMA) of the exact end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in multihop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems is analyzed.

Then, performance bounds for multihop AF relaying systems, including upper and lower bounds for the exact outage probability, average symbol error probability, and ergodic capacity, are obtained using HMA.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.113013.130653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.113013.130653","startPage":"125","endPage":"128","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6797984/06683120.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy of Harmonic Mean Approximation in Performance Analysis of Multihop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy of Harmonic Mean Approximation in Performance Analysis of Multihop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","volume":"3","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6683120/","accessionNumber":"14239336","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683120/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy of Harmonic Mean Approximation in Performance Analysis of Multihop Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"125-wcl1404-aydin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100438S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6797984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6797984","articleId":"6683120","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6683123,"authors":[{"name":"Rausley Adriano Amaral de Souza","affiliation":["National Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel), Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, MG, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rausley Adriano Amaral","lastName":"de Souza","id":"37664381800"},{"name":"Rodrigo Cogliatti","affiliation":["National Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel), Santa Rita do Sapuca\u00ed, MG, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Cogliatti","id":"38523293500"},{"name":"Michel Daoud Yacoub","affiliation":["Department of Communications, School of Electrical and Computation Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas"],"firstName":"Michel Daoud","lastName":"Yacoub","id":"37272286500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6683123","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Wireless communication","Nakagami distribution","Mathematical model","Probability density function","OFDM","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading parameters","hat functions","phase parameters","acceptance-rejection algorithm","Nakagami-m complex signal","Nakagami-m complex samples","efficient acceptance-rejection method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Random number generation","Nakagami distribution","phase statistics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683123","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.120513.130750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.120513.130750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6746479/06683123.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"96","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Acceptance-Rejection Method for Nakagami-m Complex Samples","abstract":"The aim of this Letter is to propose simple and efficient simulation means for the Nakagami-m complex signal using the acceptance-rejection algorithm.

Although previous works considered perfect, outdated, or partial channel state information at the transmitter, we stress that using such assumptions may lead to a feedback overhead for updating the SR with the ST-PR interference channel estimation. Considering only statistical knowledge of the ST-PR channel gain, we investigate a ratio selection scheme using a mean value (MV)-based power allocation strategy referred to as MV-based scheme. We first provide the exact statistics in terms of probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the secondary channel gain as well as of the interference channel gain. Furthermore, we derive exact cumulative density function of the received signal-to-noise ratio at the SR where the ST uses a power allocation based on instantaneous perfect channel state information (CSI) referred to as CSI-based scheme. These statistics are then used to derive exact closed form expressions of the outage probability, symbol error rate, and ergodic capacity of the secondary system when the interference channel from the primary transmitter (PT) to the SR is ignored. Furthermore, an asymptotical analysis is also carried out for the MV-based scheme as well as for the CSI-based scheme to derive the generalized diversity gain for each. Subsequently, we address the performance analysis based on exact statistics of the combined signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the SR of the more challenging case; when the PT-SR interference channel is considered. Numerical results in a Rayleigh fading environment manifest that the MV-based scheme outperforms the CSI-based scheme provided that a low interference power constraint is deployed, implying that the MV-based scheme is more suitable for practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06683127.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact Performance Analysis of MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems Using Transmit Antenna Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683127/","displayDocTitle":"Exact Performance Analysis of MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems Using Transmit Antenna Selection","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115579","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6683127/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Performance Analysis of MIMO Cognitive Radio Systems Using Transmit Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"425jsac0314tourki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10102S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6683127","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6683128,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Samsung Research America Dallas (SRA-D), Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6683128/6683128-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Xin (SM'10) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, in 2003.

SSCT has the following attractive features for practical implementations. First, SSCT employs a simple test statistic and thus has a low implementation complexity. Secondly, SSCT is a sequential detection algorithm and is capable of achieving performance comparable to fixed sample size detection algorithms such as energy detection but with much reduced sensing time. Thirdly, SSCT is essentially a non-coherent detection algorithm in the sense that it does not require any deterministic knowledge of the primary signals. Lastly, SSCT is able to strike a desirable trade-off between sensing performance and sensing time particularly in the signal-to-noise ratio mismatched case. To evaluate sensing performance, we derive the exact false-alarm probability for SSCT, and develop numerical integration algorithms to compute misdetection probability and the average sample number. We further demonstrate the performance of SSCT with several numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683128/","volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6683128/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14115578","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity Sequential Spectrum Sensing Algorithm for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity Sequential Spectrum Sensing Algorithm for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"387jsac0314xin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146178S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6683128","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6683129,"authors":[{"name":"Basak Guler","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6683129/6683129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Basak Guler received her B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, in 2009 and her M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Wireless Communications and Networking Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, in 2012.

The cognitive users sense their environment to determine the receivers they are interfering with, and adapt to it by designing their precoders using interference alignment (IA) in order to avoid causing performance degradation to nearby receivers. The proposed approach judiciously chooses the set of users to be aligned at each receiver as a subset of the cross-tier interferers, hence is termed selective IA. The proposed solution includes identification of the subspace in which cross-tier interference signals would be aligned followed by a distributed algorithm to identify the precoders needed at the selected interferers. The intra-tier interference is then dealt with using minimum mean squared error (MMSE) interference suppression. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of selective IA for both uplink and downlink interference management.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06683129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","startPage":"439","endPage":"450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Interference Alignment for MIMO Cognitive Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selective Interference Alignment for MIMO Cognitive Femtocell Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115568","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6683129/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Interference Alignment for MIMO Cognitive Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"439jsac0314guler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083492S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6683129","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6683130,"authors":[{"name":"Frederic Gabry","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and the ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6683130/6683130-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gabry (S'10) received the M.Sc. degree from Telecom Paristech, France (ingenieur Telecom Paris'Iech), in 2009 and the M.Sc degree and Lie, Eng. degree from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

In particular, we consider a four-node cognitive scenario where the secondary receiver is treated as a potential eavesdropper with respect to the primary transmission. The cognitive transmitter can help the primary transmission, and it should also ensure that the primary message is not leaked to the secondary user. We consider two cognitive scenarios depending on whether the secondary transmitter knows the primary message or not. In the first case, the secondary transmitter is unaware of the primary transmitter's message and acts as a helping interferer to enhance the secrecy of the primary transmission, whereas in the second case, relaying of the primary message is also within its capabilities. First, we find achievable rate regions for these two scenarios in the case of AWGN channels. We then investigate three different optimization problems: the maximization of the primary rate, the maximization of the secondary rate and the minimization of the secondary transmit power. For these optimization problems, we find closed-form expressions in important special cases. Furthermore, we analyze the cooperation between the primary and secondary transmitters from a game-theoretic perspective. We model their interaction as a Stackelberg game, for which we define and find the Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we use numerical examples to illustrate the rate regions, the three optimizations, and the impact of the Stackelberg game on the achievable rates and on the transmission strategies of the secondary transmitter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683130/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","volume":"32","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"14115565","publicationDate":"March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6683130/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimization of the Secondary Transmitter's Strategy in Cognitive Radio Channels with Secrecy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimization of the Secondary Transmitter's Strategy in Cognitive Radio Channels with Secrecy","sourcePdf":"451jsac0314gabry.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12471S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6683130","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6683132,"authors":[{"name":"William Zame","affiliation":["Departments of Economics and Mathematics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6683132/6683132-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["William Zame is a Distinguished Professor in the Departments of Economics and of Mathematics at UCLA and past Director of the California Social Sciences Experimental Laboratory.

Cognitive radio stretches this resource by enabling secondary stations to operate in portions of the spectrum that are reserved for primary stations but not currently used by the primary stations. As it is whenever stations share resources, coordination is a central issue in cognitive radio networks: absent coordination, there may be collision, congestion or interference, with concomitant loss of performance. Cognitive radio networks require coordination of secondary stations with primary stations (so that secondary stations should not interfere with primary stations) and of secondary stations with each other. Coordination in this setting is especially challenging because of the various types of sensing errors. This paper proposes novel protocols that enable secondary stations to learn and teach with the goal of coordinating to achieve a round-robin Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) schedule. These protocols are completely distributed (requiring neither central control nor the exchange of any control messages), fast (with speeds exceeding those of existing protocols), efficient (in terms of throughput and delay) and scalable. The protocols proposed rely on cooperative learning, exploiting the ability of stations to learn from and condition on their own histories while simultaneously teaching other stations about these histories. Analytic results and simulations illustrate the power of these protocols.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","startPage":"464","endPage":"477","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06683132.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning and Coordination for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6683132/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning and Coordination for Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115571","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning and Coordination for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"464jsac0314zame.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099238S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6683132","onlineDate":"12 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6683359,"authors":[{"name":"Sheyda Seyedfarshi","affiliation":["NRI - Iran"],"firstName":"Sheyda","lastName":"Seyedfarshi"},{"name":"Kaveh Pourmostadam","affiliation":["NRI - Iran"],"firstName":"Kaveh","lastName":"Pourmostadam"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-732-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6683359","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power distribution planning","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network","gap analysis method","smart power gird implementation","Iran electric grid structure"]}],"abstract":"The first step in planning for the smart grid implementation is to identify the present state of the grid and its infrastructure, the next step being to describe the vision.

A galaxy image is sampled with a number of points randomly chosen, whose Delaunay triangulation results in an arbitrary graph. The average intensity value in a 5 \u00d7 5 vicinity of a pixel related to a graph vertex is assigned to the corresponding graph vertex. A weight inversely proportional to the photometric distance between each pair of vertices is assigned to the respective graph edge. The Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform is computed from this weighted graph with real-valued vertices yielding a high-dimensional feature vector, which is reduced to a two dimensional vector through Principal Component Analysis. The proposed framework has been assessed through two case studies, namely, the case study of analyzing (i) 2D binary images from shapes and preliminary results of (ii) 2D gray tone images from galaxies. The obtained results imply the suitability of this framework for the characterization of galaxies images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on e-Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6680792/6683875/06683922.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on e-Science","doi":"10.1109/eScience.2013.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2013.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6683875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape Analysis Using the Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Shape","Wavelet domain","Wavelet analysis","Topology","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical image processing","astronomical photometry","Galaxy","graph theory","image sampling","mesh generation","principal component analysis","spectral analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape analysis","spectral graph wavelet transform","galaxy morphological characterization","galaxy image sampling","Delaunay triangulation","average intensity value","graph vertex","photometric distance","real-valued vertices","high-dimensional feature vector","principal component analysis","2D binary images","2D gray tone images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer vision","pattern recognition","shape analysis","graphs","spectral graphs","wavelets","spectral graph wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Shape Analysis Using the Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6683922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974093","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape Analysis Using the Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5083a307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097876S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6680792","isNumber":"6683875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6680792","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6683875","articleId":"6683922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6683951,"authors":[{"name":"Qingshan Tang","affiliation":["Laboratoire Informatique Paris-6, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie CURIE, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Qingshan","lastName":"Tang","id":"38529162500"},{"name":"Habib Mehrez","affiliation":["Laboratoire Informatique Paris-6, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie CURIE, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Mehrez","id":"37284092100"},{"name":"Matthieu Tuna","affiliation":["Flexras Technologies, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Tuna","id":"37277313300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2410-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"6683951","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","Receivers","Algorithm design and analysis","Time division multiplexing","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","multiterminal networks","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-FPGA boards","timing delays","inter-FPGA physical tracks","intra-FPGA track delays","multiterminal nets","multipoint tracks","Gaisler Research Benchmarks","testbench","off-the-shelf board","system frequency","routing algorithm","automatic design flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-Terminal Net","Routing Algorithm","Multi-FPGA","Multi-Point Physical Tracks"]}],"abstract":"Multi-FPGA boards suffer from large timing delays in inter-FPGA physical tracks compared to intra-FPGA track delays, as well as a limited bandwidth between FPGAs due to the limited number of I/Os per FPGA.

The results show that the system frequency can be increased in the off-the-shelf board by the proposed routing algorithm. Secondly, an automatic design flow which generates a custom multi-FPGA board is enhanced by generating multi-point tracks in the board, and each testbench will be implemented with the proposed routing algorithm in custom boards.

This paper explores with an example the possibility of realizing a flexible channel decoder to implement and validate new/incremental algorithm changes with fast turnaround time in design. An application specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) is proposed as flexible core that can decode low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the various block sizes and code rates as specified in WiFi and WiMAX standards.

Moreover, existing approaches are not able to integrate the notion of partial and dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) from the early stages of the decision phases, potentially leading to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose SMASH (Simultaneous Mapping and Scheduling with Heuristics), a highly automated design methodology focused on explicitly taking into account PDR during the design of reconfigurable designs. It combines heuristics for both the design of the architecture and the mapping and scheduling of the partitioned application. We show how this additional degree of freedom leads to architectures whose performance are improved with respect to the baseline.","doi":"10.1109/RSP.2013.6683965","startPage":"102","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6676470/6683946/06683965.pdf","endPage":"108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6683946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2013.6683965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683965/","displayDocTitle":"SMASH: A heuristic methodology for designing partially reconfigurable MPSoCs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6683965/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13973936","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SMASH: A heuristic methodology for designing partially reconfigurable MPSoCs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062365S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6676470","isNumber":"6683946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676470","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6683946","articleId":"6683965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6683970,"authors":[{"name":"Shakith Fernando","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Shakith","lastName":"Fernando","id":"37562391200"},{"name":"Firew Siyoum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Firew","lastName":"Siyoum","id":"38228687400"},{"name":"Yifan He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"He","id":"37532424700"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"},{"name":"Henk Corporaal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Corporaal","id":"37266918700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2410-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5500"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5519"}],"articleNumber":"6683970","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"abstract":"Heterogeneous Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (HMPSoC) are becoming popular as a means of meeting energy efficiency requirements of modern embedded systems. However, as these HMPSoCs run multimedia applications as well, they also need to meet real-time requirements. Designing these predictable HMPSoCs is a key challenge, as the current design methods for these platforms are either semi-automated, non-predictable, or have limited heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a design framework to generate and program HMPSoC designs in a rapid and predictable manner. It takes the application specifications and the architecture model as input and generates the entire HMPSoC, for FPGA prototyping, that meets the throughput constraints. The experimental results show that our framework can provide a conservative bound on the worst-case throughput of the FPGA implementation. We also present results of a case study that computes the area-power trade-offs of an industrial vision application. The entire design space exploration of all configurations was completed in 8 hours. A tool-chain targeting the Xilinx Zynq FPGA is also presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Analytical models","Field programmable gate arrays","Nickel","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAMPSx","predictable heterogeneous MPSoC","heterogeneous multiprocessor system-on-chips","predictable HMPSoC","energy efficiency requirement","embedded system","multimedia application","architecture model","FPGA prototyping","area power trade-off","industrial vision application","Xilinx Zynq FPGA","time 8 hour"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RSP.2013.6683970","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Rapid System Prototyping (RSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6676470/6683946/06683970.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6683946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSP.2013.6683970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAMPSx: A design framework for rapid synthesis of predictable heterogeneous MPSoCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6683970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MAMPSx: A design framework for rapid synthesis of predictable heterogeneous MPSoCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6683970/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6683970/","accessionNumber":"13973929","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAMPSx: A design framework for rapid synthesis of predictable heterogeneous MPSoCs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061085S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6676470","isNumber":"6683946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676470","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6683946","articleId":"6683970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6684031,"authors":[{"name":"Iman Samizadeh","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Centre, London Metropolitan University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Samizadeh","id":"37086128797"},{"name":"Hassan B.

ZigBee is commonly used in wireless architecture and in controlling and monitoring applications. ZigBee's cost effective potential makes it highly likely that it will soon be used to transfer large amounts of data or stream video. However, ZigBee's current bandwidth is very low for video transmissions over IEEE 802.15.4 networks, therefore this will be difficult to achieve. Additionally, the ZigBee limitation could become a real problem if the user wishes to transmit a large amount of data in a very short time. Hence, in this paper a solution has been accomplished by applying Particle Swarm Optimization to Scalable Rate Control in order to increase the available bandwidth, which leads to both an improvement in the quality of picture and a reduction in the data loss when transmitting MPEG-4 video over the ZigBee wireless sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684031","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684026","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675893/6684026/06684031.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive scalable rate control over IEEE 802.15.4 using particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684031/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive scalable rate control over IEEE 802.15.4 using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684031/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13973867","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive scalable rate control over IEEE 802.15.4 using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s01p01id002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05669S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675893","isNumber":"6684026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675893","xplore-issue":"6684026","articleId":"6684031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6684046,"authors":[{"name":"Hanqing Hu","affiliation":["CECS Department, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, U.S"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086597901"},{"name":"Mehmed M.

In an extremely unbalanced data set, usually a lot of data points need to be labeled to get enough minority class samples. The goal of this research was to reduce the total number of samples needed in the labeling process of training new classification models for updating streaming data ensemble classifier. Our proposed approach is to find minority class clusters using the grid density algorithm, and sample minority class instances inside those regions. The result from the synthetic data set showed that efficiency of our proposed approaches varies with different grid sizes. Results on real world data sets confirmed that observation, and showed that when the data set has high dimensionality, dimensionality reduction was useful for reducing the number of grids in the data space increasing sampling efficiency. Our best results showed 19.4% improvement for an eight-dimension data set without dimensionality reduction, and 27.4% improvement for a thirty-six-dimension data set with dimensionality reduction.","doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684046","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675893/6684026/06684046.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting samples for labeling in unbalanced streaming data environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","displayDocTitle":"Selecting samples for labeling in unbalanced streaming data environments","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684046/","accessionNumber":"13973875","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684046/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting samples for labeling in unbalanced streaming data environments","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s03p04id102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04873S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675893","isNumber":"6684026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675893","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6684026","articleId":"6684046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6684073,"authors":[{"name":"Alma Husagic-Selman","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, International University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, BiH"],"firstName":"Alma","lastName":"Husagic-Selman","id":"38357436200"},{"name":"Rasit Koker","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Rasit","lastName":"Koker","id":"37992022200"},{"name":"Suvad Selman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, International University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, BiH"],"firstName":"Suvad","lastName":"Selman","id":"38132062200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0431-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6684073","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Principal component analysis","Training","Artificial neural networks","Biological neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","computer network security","neural nets","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network committee machine","computer technology","communication technology","intrusion detection system","false positive rate","FPR","false negative rate","FNR","attack detection precision","NNCM IDS","input reduction system","principal component analysis","PCA","backpropagation neural network","offline system update"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Neural Networks","Committee Machine","Intelligent Intrusion Detection System"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684073","abstract":"Intrusion detection plays an important role in todays computer and communication technology.

The main challenge of operating plasma etchers is to maintain a consistent etch rate spatially and temporally for a given wafer and for successive wafers processed in the same etch tool. Etch rate measurements require expensive metrology steps and therefore in general only limited sampling is performed. Furthermore, the results of measurements are not accessible in real-time, limiting the options for run-to-run control. This paper investigates a Virtual Metrology (VM) enabled Dynamic Sampling (DS) methodology as an alternative paradigm for balancing the need to reduce costly metrology with the need to measure more frequently and in a timely fashion to enable wafer-to-wafer control. Using a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) VM model for etch rate estimation of a plasma etch process, the proposed dynamic sampling methodology is demonstrated and evaluated for a number of different predictive dynamic sampling rules.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasmas","Ground penetrating radar","Metrology","Semiconductor device modeling","Data models","Semiconductor device measurement","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","production facilities","regression analysis","sputter etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic sampling methodology","plasma etch process","Gaussian process regression","semiconductor manufacturing facilities","wet chemical etch technology","plasma etchers","successive wafers","run-to-run control","virtual metrology","wafer-to-wafer control","GPR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Sampling","Virtual Metrology","Gaussian Processes","Plasma Etch"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684080","publicationTitle":"2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 XXIV International Conference on Information, Communication and Automation Technologies (ICAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6675893/6684026/06684080.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAT.2013.6684080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic sampling methodology for plasma etch processes using Gaussian process regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic sampling methodology for plasma etch processes using Gaussian process regression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684080/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684080/","accessionNumber":"13973876","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic sampling methodology for plasma etch processes using Gaussian process regression","confLoc":"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina","sourcePdf":"s08p03id029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06441S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6675893","isNumber":"6684026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675893","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6684026","articleId":"6684080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6684140,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Psaras","affiliation":["University College London, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6919360/6684140/6684140-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Psaras received a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Democritus University of Thrace, Greece in 2004, and the PhD degree from the same institute in 2008.

We argue that in Information-Centric Networking environments, deterministically caching content messages at predefined places along the content delivery path results in unfair and inefficient content multiplexing between different content flows, as well as in significant caching redundancy. Instead, allocating resources along the path according to content flow characteristics results in better use of network resources and therefore, higher overall performance. The design principles of our proposed in-network caching scheme, which we call ProbCache, target these two outcomes, namely reduction of caching redundancy and fair content flow multiplexing along the delivery path. In particular, ProbCache approximates the caching capability of a path and caches contents probabilistically to: 1) leave caching space for other flows sharing (part of) the same path, and 2) fairly multiplex contents in caches along the path from the server to the client. We elaborate on the content multiplexing fairness of ProbCache and find that it sometimes behaves in favor of content flows connected far away from the source, that is, it gives higher priority to flows travelling longer paths, leaving little space to shorter-path flows. We introduce an enhanced version of the main algorithm that guarantees fair behavior to all participating content flows. We evaluate the proposed schemes in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cache size environments and formulate a framework for resource allocation in in-network caching environments. The proposed probabilistic approach to in-network caching exhibits ideal performance both in terms of network resource utilization and in terms of resource allocation fairness among competing content flows. Finally, and in contrast to the expected behavior, we find that the efficient design of ProbCache results in fast convergence to caching of popular content items.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6919360","startPage":"2920","endPage":"2931","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6919360/06684140.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Network Cache Management and Resource Allocation for Information-Centric Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684140/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"In-Network Cache Management and Resource Allocation for Information-Centric Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14652065","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Network Cache Management and Resource Allocation for Information-Centric Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-psaras-304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083144S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6919360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6919360","articleId":"6684140","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6684147,"authors":[{"name":"Gilbert Kowarzyk","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"],"firstName":"Gilbert","lastName":"Kowarzyk","id":"38093786400"},{"name":"Normand B\u00e9langer","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"],"firstName":"Normand","lastName":"B\u00e9langer","id":"37295069000"},{"name":"David Haccoun","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Haccoun","id":"37276818400"},{"name":"Yvon Savaria","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"],"firstName":"Yvon","lastName":"Savaria","id":"37276922900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"6684147","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"44KB","file":"/ielx7/71/6919360/6684147/graphical_abstract/tpds-gagraphic-311.gif","coverImage":""},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684147","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Optimization","Encoding","Systematics","Indexes","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","error correction codes","optimisation","orthogonal codes","parallel processing","resource allocation","telecommunication computing","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel tree-search optimization","shortest-span error-correcting CDO codes","optimal-short-span convolutional self-doubly orthogonal codes","simplified-CDO codes","S-CDO codes","implicitly-exhaustive search algorithm","CDO validation function","high-performance pseudorandom search algorithms","deterministic search-space reduction","data structure","load-balancing techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional code","self-doubly orthogonal code","parallel tree-traversal","data-reuse","systematic encoder","threshold decoder"]}],"abstract":"Finding optimal/short-span Convolutional Self-Doubly Orthogonal (CDO) codes and Simplified-CDO (S-CDO) codes for a specified order J is computationally very challenging.

These speedups are achieved through enhancements in the deterministic search-space reduction, and a vastly improved validation function that makes use of a novel data structure for enabling data-reuse and incremental computations. The resulting validation function speedup is greater than 60 000 (S-CDO, J = 17) and 190 000 (CDO, J = 17) when compared to its reference implementation.

Web services have been widely employed for building service-oriented applications in both industry and academia in recent years. The number of publicly available Web services is steadily increasing on the Internet. However, this proliferation makes it hard for a user to select a proper Web service among a large amount of service candidates. An inappropriate service selection may cause many problems (e.g., ill-suited performance) to the resulting applications. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative filtering-based Web service recommender system to help users select services with optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS) performance. Our recommender system employs the location information and QoS values to cluster users and services, and makes personalized service recommendation for users based on the clustering results. Compared with existing service recommendation methods, our approach achieves considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy. Comprehensive experiments are conducted involving more than 1.5 million QoS records of real-world Web services to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6828815/06684151.pdf","startPage":"1913","endPage":"1924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6828815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Service Recommendation via Exploiting Location and QoS Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684151/","displayDocTitle":"Web Service Recommendation via Exploiting Location and QoS Information","volume":"25","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396637","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684151/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Service Recommendation via Exploiting Location and QoS Information","sourcePdf":"tpds-zheng-308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093418S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6828815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6828815","articleId":"6684151","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6684156,"authors":[{"name":"Waseem Ahmed","affiliation":["Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7010070/6684156/6684156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Waseem Ahmed received the MSc degree from the Computer Science Department of Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, in 2002.

For Internet services, the presence of low-performance servers, high latency or overall poor service quality can translate into lost sales, user frustration, and customers lost. In this paper, we propose a novel method for QoS metrification based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which further suggests an optimal path for the execution of user requests. The technique we show can be used to measure and predict the behavior of Web Services in terms of response time, and can thus be used to rank services quantitatively rather than just qualitatively. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of our methodology by drawing experiments on real world data. The results have shown how our proposed method can help the user to automatically select the most reliable Web Service taking into account several metrics, among them, system predictability and response time variability.

This paper exploits a cellular computing model in the slime mold physarum polycephalum to solve the Steiner tree problem which is an important NP-hard problem in various applications, especially in network design. Inspired by the path-finding and network formation capability of physarum, we develop a new optimization algorithm, named as the physarum optimization, with low complexity and high parallelism. To validate and evaluate ourproposed models and algorithm, we furtherapplythe physarum optimization to the minimal exposure problem which is a fundamental problem corresponding to the worst-case coverage in wireless sensor networks. Complexity analysis and simulation results show that our proposed algorithm could achieve good performance with low complexity. Moreover, the core mechanism of our physarum optimization also may provide a useful starting point to develop some practical distributed algorithms for network design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684158/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14914310","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Physarum Optimization: A Biology-Inspired Algorithm for the Steiner Tree Problem in Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physarum Optimization: A Biology-Inspired Algorithm for the Steiner Tree Problem in Networks","sourcePdf":"tc-liu-2290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117143S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7031983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7031983","articleId":"6684158","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6684181,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Guo","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Jing Guo is a PhD candidate in microelectronics and solid-state electronics at Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

The traditional single-error correction, double-error detection (SEC-DED) codes are not enough because transient multiple-cell upsets (MCUs) are becoming major issues in SRAM reliability. One-step majority-logic decodable (OS-MLD) codes that can correct MCUs are a good choice due to low complexity and latency. However, these codes restrict the choice of code-word lengths such that they can't be directly used to protect memories with common word lengths (that is, a power of two). This article proposes novel mixed codes (MCs), which are constructed by doubly transitive invariant (DTI) and Hamming codes, to mitigate MCUs in common memories with lower overheads and higher code rates. For the Hamming codes, the encoder-reuse technique (ERT) is used to minimize area overhead without disturbing the whole encoding and decoding process. In addition, the puncturing technique is used to increase the code rates of the proposed codes. As an application example, the authors evaluate a (64, 42) double-error correction (DEC) MC and compare it with the existing DEC codes. The results show that the proposed MC with higher code rate can not only effectively mitigate MCUs in memories but also reduce the overheads of the extra circuits and memory cells.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13972789","htmlLink":"/document/6684181/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Novel Mixed Codes for Multiple-Cell Upsets Mitigation in Static RAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Mixed Codes for Multiple-Cell Upsets Mitigation in Static RAMs","sourcePdf":"mmi2013060066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098382S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"40","isNumber":"6684176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6684176","articleId":"6684181","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6684194,"authors":[{"name":"Noriyuki Miura","affiliation":["Keio University"],"bio":{"p":["Noriyuki Miura is an assistant professor at the Graduate School of System Informatics at Kobe University, working on mixed-signal sensor design including 3D heterogeneous integration.

The proposed method also includes a new adaptive neural network control scheme where the objective for the robot end effector can be specified as a dynamic region, instead of the desired position or trajectory. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using Lyapunov-like analysis. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach and the energy-saving property of the proposed neural network controller with dynamic region.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2013.2293498","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2013.2293498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/6800075/06684277.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Control of Robot Based on a Unified Objective Bound","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684277/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Control of Robot Based on a Unified Objective Bound","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6684277/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14251215","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001348","fundingName":"Agency for Science, Technology and Research","grantNumber":"1121202014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Control of Robot Based on a Unified Objective Bound","sourcePdf":"tcst-li-2293498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132958S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6800075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6800075","articleId":"6684277","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6684279,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanming Zhu","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38466553400"},{"name":"Zhongsheng Hou","affiliation":["Advanced Control Systems Laboratory, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongsheng","lastName":"Hou","id":"37279945500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6684279","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1296},"abstract":"A novel model-free adaptive control method is proposed for a class of discrete-time single input single output (SISO) nonlinear systems, where the equivalent dynamic linearization technique is used on the ideal nonlinear controller.

In general, the EMF should be canceled for every space, time, and load condition of interest. Three generalized design methods for cancelling the EMF of WEV are proposed in this paper. By adding active EMF cancel coils to each primary main coil and secondary main coil, respectively, the EMF generated from each main coil can be independently cancelled by their corresponding cancel coils. Moreover, the EMF can be successfully mitigated if a dominant EMF source only is cancelled with 3-dB margin, which can be applied to any resonant type wireless power transfer systems. Furthermore, no significant power drop may occur if the cancel coils are placed aside from magnetic coupling path. Design examples are shown for U-type and W-type IPTS as well as a wireless stationary EV charger. Experimental verifications are shown for a recently developed I-type IPTS, which has a narrow rail width structure with alternating magnetic polarity along with a roadway. The proposed design methods have been demonstrated, without the loss of generality, to only the secondary coil where relatively large EMF is generated due to high ampere turns. An optimum spacing for cancel coils from main coils and an optimum number of turns are determined. Through experiments, additional EMF mitigation techniques such as the magnetic mirror method, separating pick-up rectifiers, and passive Al plate are provided. Thus, the EMF at 1 m distance from the center of a pick-up becomes under 44 mG even for the maximum power of 12 kW.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Wireless communication","Electric vehicles","Magnetic fields","Magnetic flux","Magnetic resonance","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","electric vehicles","inductive power transmission","superconducting coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive plate","separating pick up rectifiers","magnetic mirror method","alternating magnetic polarity","EMF cancel coils","electromagnetic field","inductive power transfer systems","wireless electric vehicles","generalized active EMF cancel methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic field (EMF)","inductive power transfer system (IPTS)","I-type","wireless electric vehicle (WEV)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2295094","startPage":"5770","endPage":"5783","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6850100/06684288.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2295094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Active EMF Cancel Methods for Wireless Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized Active EMF Cancel Methods for Wireless Electric Vehicles","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14429996","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","volume":"29","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684288/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2010-0029179"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Active EMF Cancel Methods for Wireless Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tpel-choi-2295094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165471S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6850100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6850100","articleId":"6684288","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6684289,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Nassar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6744712/6684289/6684289-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcel Nassar (M'05) received the B.E. degree in computer and communications engineering, with a minor degree in mathematics, from the American University of Beirut in 2006, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2008 and 2013, respectively.","During his studies, he interned at the University of California, Berkeley in 2005, at Intel Corporation in 2008 and 2009, and at Texas Instruments in 2011 and 2012.

Impulsive noise arises in many modern wireless and wireline communication systems, such as Wi-Fi and powerline communications, due to uncoordinated interference that is much stronger than thermal noise. We first show that the bit-error-rate optimal receiver jointly estimates the propagation channel coefficients, the noise impulses, the finite-alphabet symbols, and the unknown bits. We then propose a near-optimal yet computationally tractable approach to this joint estimation problem using loopy belief propagation. In particular, we merge the recently proposed \u201cgeneralized approximate message passing\u201d (GAMP) algorithm with the forward-backward algorithm and soft-input soft-output decoding using a \u201cturbo\u201d approach. Numerical results indicate that the proposed receiver drastically outperforms existing receivers under impulsive noise and comes within 1 dB of the matched-filter bound. Meanwhile, with N tones, the proposed factor-graph-based receiver has only O(NlogN) complexity, and it can be parallelized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Factor Graph Approach to Joint OFDM Channel Estimation and Decoding in Impulsive Noise Environments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2295063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6744712/06684289.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2295063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6744712","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Factor Graph Approach to Joint OFDM Channel Estimation and Decoding in Impulsive Noise Environments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6684289/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2014","publicationDate":"March15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14142702","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Factor Graph Approach to Joint OFDM Channel Estimation and Decoding in Impulsive Noise Environments","sourcePdf":"tsp-nassar-2295063-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10547S","chronDate":"March15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6744712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6744712","articleId":"6684289","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6684296,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Xu","affiliation":["Bio-Computing Research Center, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6898047/6684296/xu-2293391-small.gif","p":["Yong Xu (M'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Air Force College of Meteorology, Nanjing, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligence system from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, in 2005.","From 2005 to 2007, he was with Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow.

However, this deviation does not always well reflect the difference between the test sample and each class. With this paper, we propose a novel representation-based classification method for face recognition. This method integrates conventional and the inverse representation-based classification for better recognizing the face. It first produces conventional representation of the test sample, i.e., uses a linear combination of the training samples to represent the test sample. Then it obtains the inverse representation, i.e., provides an approximation representation of each training sample of a subject by exploiting the test sample and training samples of the other subjects. Finally, the proposed method exploits the conventional and inverse representation to generate two kinds of scores of the test sample with respect to each class and combines them to recognize the face. The paper shows the theoretical foundation and rationale of the proposed method. Moreover, this paper for the first time shows that a basic nature of the human face, i.e., the symmetry of the face can be exploited to generate new training and test samples. As these new samples really reflect some possible appearance of the face, the use of them will enable us to obtain higher accuracy. The experiments show that the proposed conventional and inverse representation-based linear regression classification (CIRLRC), an improvement to linear regression classification (LRC), can obtain very high accuracy and greatly outperforms the naive LRC and other state-of-the-art conventional representation based face recognition methods. The accuracy of CIRLRC can be 10% greater than that of LRC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684296/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581854","pubMedId":"25222718","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Conventional and Inverse Representation for Face Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61125106, 61370163, 61233011, 91120302, 61203376 and 61332011"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Council","grantNumber":"JC201005260122A, JCYJ20120613153352732 and CXZZ20120613141657279"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Key Innovation Team of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2012KCT-04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Conventional and Inverse Representation for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-li-2293391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098646S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6898047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6898047","articleId":"6684296","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6684297,"authors":[{"name":"Sachit Rao","affiliation":["Systemantics India Pvt Ltd., Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Sachit","lastName":"Rao","id":"37632841800"},{"name":"Debasish Ghose","affiliation":["Guidance, Control, and Decision Systems Laboratory, Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Debasish","lastName":"Ghose","id":"37282785700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6684297","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1858},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"In this brief, decentralized sliding mode controllers that enable a connected and leaderless swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to reach a consensus in altitude and heading angle are presented.

The proposed approach guarantees correct task execution and compliance of the robot's body during intentional or accidental interaction in the null space of the main task, simultaneously. The asymptotic stability of the task-space error is ensured by using suitable observers to estimate and compensate the generalized forces acting on the task variables, without using joint torque measurements. Two different controller-observer algorithms are designed, and they are based on the task-space error and on the generalized momentum of the robot, respectively.

Using the well-known and challenging FRGC v2 dataset, we report a superior performance compared to other algorithms, with a 97.83% verification rate for probes with all facial expressions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Face Recognition Using Curvelet Local Features","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2295119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6687259/06684301.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2295119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"3-D Face Recognition Using Curvelet Local Features","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6684301/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13996556","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Face Recognition Using Curvelet Local Features","sourcePdf":"lsp-elaiwat-2295119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081409S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6687259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6687259","articleId":"6684301","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6684304,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Akcakaya","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Depratment, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4664312/6805676/6684304/6684304-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Akcakaya (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912) received the B.Sc. in electrical and electronics engineering from the Department of Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2005, and the M.Sc. and the Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA, in May and December 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Research Assistant Professor at Northeastern University, Boston, MA.

We show that the SAR image can be reconstructed simultaneously in the range and azimuth directions from a small number of the raw data. The proposed algorithm can handle large-scale data because both the CSO and its inverse allow fast matrix-vector multiplications.

Given a fixed total bandwidth for the two feedback channels, the receiver must determine how to allocate its feedback bits to the transmitter and helper. Assuming zero-forcing transmission at the helper and random vector quantization of the channels, an analytic expression for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate due to the resulting quantization errors is derived. While direct optimization of the secrecy rate is difficult, an approximate upper bound for the mean loss in secrecy rate is derived and a feedback bit allocation method that minimizes the average upper bound on the secrecy rate loss is studied. A closed-form solution is shown to be possible if the integer constraint on the bit allocation is relaxed. Numerical simulations indicate the significant advantage that can be achieved by adaptively allocating the available feedback bits.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2295059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06684307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2295059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","startPage":"993","endPage":"1004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Limited Feedback for MISO Wiretap Channels With Cooperative Jamming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Limited Feedback for MISO Wiretap Channels With Cooperative Jamming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14056592","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6684307/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Limited Feedback for MISO Wiretap Channels With Cooperative Jamming","sourcePdf":"tsp-pei-2295059-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097675S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6684307","onlineDate":"13 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6684313,"authors":[{"name":"Leqi Zhang","affiliation":["ESAT, Katholieke Universitet Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Leqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38495543500"},{"name":"Augusto Redolfi","affiliation":["Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Redolfi","id":"38483626400"},{"name":"Christoph Adelmann","affiliation":["Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Adelmann","id":"37314104900"},{"name":"Sergiu Clima","affiliation":["Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sergiu","lastName":"Clima","id":"37568184200"},{"name":"Iuliana P.

The CS theory shows that when a signal is sparsely rendered on some basis, it can be recovered exactly by a relatively small set of random measurements of the original signal. In this paper, such notion is applied to a more general case to analyze nonlinear PolSAR data. Therefore, the NCSLT model is presented with the following two objectives: to capture the nonlinear structure of PolSAR data on a manifold surface using the CS theory and to provide a generative explanation for the relationship between the image pixels and high-level complex scenes for image classification by establishing a Texture-CS-Topic model. Compared with the other traditional SAR image-classification methods, the proposed method displayed potential achievements when applied to two sets of PolSAR image data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote

Therefore, many methods have been proposed and designed to enhance the CR system performance. In this paper, an improvement for ED performance is achieved by using digital signal processing (DSP) for the primary user (PU) signal before taking the final decision by the secondary user (SU). Firstly, the uncertain noise power will be estimated (signal to noise ratio (SNR) estimation) by the SU to find the quantity of the noise that is affected on the PU signal. Secondly, signal denoising technique will be applied on the noisy PU signal to reduce the noise effect on ED technique accuracy. Consequently, hybrid slantlet transform (HST) has been used to implement these two proposed solutions of noise impact alleviation. Moreover, HST is a set of digital filters which separate the noise from the non-stationary PU signals. Simulation results compare the detection performance of the proposed approach with wavelet approach based signal denoising technique which was used in ED before. Furthermore, the results show the obvious superiority for our proposed approach in comparison with wavelet approach in the detection probability versus the SNR and false alarm probability for different number of PU signal samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684368/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13974049","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684368/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy detection performance enhancement for cognitive radio using noise processing approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy detection performance enhancement for cognitive radio using noise processing approach","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569814859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048683S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679355","isNumber":"6684341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679355","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6684341","articleId":"6684368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6684371,"authors":[{"name":"Merad Boudia Omar Rafik","affiliation":["STIC Laboratory, University of Tlemcen, Algeria"],"firstName":"Merad Boudia","lastName":"Omar Rafik","id":"37072910100"},{"name":"Feham Mohammed","affiliation":["STIC Laboratory, University of Tlemcen, Algeria"],"firstName":"Feham","lastName":"Mohammed","id":"38257598500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2969-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3281"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-329X"}],"articleNumber":"6684371","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Barium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECC","elliptic curve cryptography","concealed data aggregation","WSN","wireless sensor network","secure data aggregation","sensor deployment","elliptic curve El Gamal","end-to-end confidentiality","ECEG","fast scalar multiplication","side channel attack","simple power analysis","fast point decompression algorithm","homomorphic operation","secure encryption","storage capacity 8 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["secure data aggregation","wireless sensor networks","elliptic curve cryptography","homomorphic encryption"]}],"abstract":"In the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), research on secure data aggregation has grown dramatically in the past few years, since the sensors are deployed in unattended and hostile environments. For this purpose, end-to-end solutions known as concealed data aggregation have been proposed to provide privacy between the sensors and the sink. The recent experiments showed that the Elliptic Curve El Gamal (ECEG) is the most suitable cryptosystem for WSNs in order to provide the end-to-end confidentiality with a high level of security based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). However, the execution time remains the major drawback due to the complexity of ECC operations and the nature of sensor nodes which are equipped with limited computer resources. Therefore, an efficient implementation of such operations is then crucial. In this paper, we present a fast and secure implementation of ECEG in MicaZ mote, based on an enhanced version of TinyECC library, a fast scalar multiplication is employed, which is also secure against side channel attacks (in particular simple power analysis). Moreover, a fast point decompression algorithm needed for homomorphic operation is used to efficiently computing square roots in prime fields, satisfying p = 3 mod 4. Our results show that a secure encryption of ECEG takes only 1.29s, which is considerably better than previous software implementations on 8-bits platforms.","doi":"10.1109/GIIS.2013.6684371","publicationTitle":"Global Information Infrastructure Symposium - GIIS 2013","displayPublicationTitle":"Global Information Infrastructure Symposium - GIIS 2013","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679355/6684341/06684371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GIIS.2013.6684371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and secure implementation of ECC-based concealed data aggregation in WSN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684371/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and secure implementation of ECC-based concealed data aggregation in WSN","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684371/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974028","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and secure implementation of ECC-based concealed data aggregation in WSN","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569815167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064632S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679355","isNumber":"6684341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679355","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6684341","articleId":"6684371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6684372,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In particular, approximate outage probability expressions are derived and the effect of different IQI parameters is analyzed for different ranges of SNR. The diversity order is also derived depending on the IQI levels. Furthermore, we explain when and where it is more beneficial to invest in compensating the imbalance or in increasing the transmission power.

It is very important in such migrations of VMs to decide when to move which VM to what physical machine. Random or naive migrations may result into degradation in overall performance of the cluster.

In recent years many clients from all over the world are demanding the various services at rapid rate. Many algorithms have been designed to carry out the client's request towards the cloud nodes. Accordingly the cloud computing platform will dynamically configure its servers and these servers may be present physically or virtually in the computing environment. Hence, selecting the virtual machines or servers has to be scheduled properly by using an appropriate load balancing approach. In the present work, a local optimized load balancing approach is proposed for distributing of incoming jobs uniformly among the servers or virtual machines. Further, the performance is analyzed using CloudAnalyst simulator and compared with existing Round Robin and Throttled algorithms. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has distributed the load uniformly among virtual machines.","doi":"10.1109/CCEM.2013.6684434","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6684339/6684412/06684434.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCEM.2013.6684434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Balancing in Cloud Computingusing Modified Throttled Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684434/","displayDocTitle":"Load Balancing in Cloud Computingusing Modified Throttled Algorithm","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684434/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","conferenceDate":"16-18 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974124","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Balancing in Cloud Computingusing Modified Throttled Algorithm","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"pid1149334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039566S","chronDate":"16-18 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6684339","isNumber":"6684412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6684339","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6684412","articleId":"6684434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6684476,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander D\u00f6tlinger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"D\u00f6tlinger","id":"38666589500"},{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Stumper","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Stumper","id":"38557428600"},{"name":"Ralph Kennel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Kennel","id":"38557336200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0681-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0680-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-6725"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-6733"}],"articleNumber":"6684476","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Planning","Vectors","DC motors","Current measurement","Permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","feedforward","optimal control","path planning","predictive control","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receding horizon based trajectory planning method","two-degree-of-freedom tracking control","fast sampling constrained systems","receding horizon based control","model predictive control","state constraints","input constraints","sampling control system","constraint handling","input trajectories","state trajectories","tracking behavior","dynamic feedforward path","dynamic feedforward control","dynamical two-mass system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a trajectory planning method inspired by receding horizon based control - for example model predictive control. To plan a trajectory that is perfectly trackable by an underlying controller, a cost functional with input and state constraints is minimized. The proposed planning method is decoupled from a very fast sampling control system in the 100 kHz range because of the relatively high computational demand. This structure allows to profit from the advantages of model predictive control, such as the handling of constraints, even for very fast sampling systems. Here the state and input trajectories which are naturally available in receding horizon based trajectory planning are used to improve the tracking behavior with the help of a dynamic feed-forward path. This concept of dynamic feed-forward control enables perfect tracking of the planned trajectory even in dynamic operation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning and control approach for a highly dynamical two-mass system. The proposed scheme is compared to two conventional control techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLED-PRECEDE.2013.6684476","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives and Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (SLED/PRECEDE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives and Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (SLED/PRECEDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678915/6684473/06684476.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/SLED-PRECEDE.2013.6684476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receding horizon based trajectory planning and two-degree-of-freedom tracking control for fast sampling constrained systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Receding horizon based trajectory planning and two-degree-of-freedom tracking control for fast sampling constrained systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684476/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974490","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684476/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receding horizon based trajectory planning and two-degree-of-freedom tracking control for fast sampling constrained systems","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"p12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060518S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678915","isNumber":"6684473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678915","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6684473","articleId":"6684476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6684480,"authors":[{"name":"Helfried Peyrl","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Helfried","lastName":"Peyrl","id":"37643907600"},{"name":"Junyi Liu","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37075293300"},{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37391100100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0681-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0680-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-6725"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-6733"}],"articleNumber":"6684480","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684480","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Vectors","Stator windings","Field programmable gate arrays","Gradient methods","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","gradient methods","power electronics","predictive control","quadratic programming","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","fast gradient method","model predictive pulse pattern control problem","computational complexity","MP3C","optimisation-based control method","power electronic systems","quadratic program"]}],"abstract":"The computational complexity of Model Predictive Pulse Pattern Control (MP\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nC) and its real-time requirements have so far limited the deployment of this optimisation-based control method for power electronic systems.

Enumeration-based model predictive control (MPC) methods are very simple, easy to understand and, in general, offer the possibility to control any nonlinear system with arbitrary user-defined terms in the cost function. However, the two most important drawbacks are the increased computational effort which is required and the high ripples on the controlled variables which limit the applicability of these methods. These high ripples result from the fact that in enumeration-based MPC algorithms the actuating variable can only be changed at the beginning of a sampling interval. However, by changing the applied voltage vector within the sampling interval, a voltage vector can be applied for a shorter time than one sample, which results in a reduced ripple. Since this strategy leads to an additional overhead which is crucial especially for multilevel inverters, it is combined with a heuristic preselection of the optimal voltage vector to reduce the calculation effort. Experimental results are provided to verify the proposed strategy. Furthermore, it will be shown experimentally that a conventional enumeration-based MPC method will lead to very low switching frequencies and high current ripples at low machine speeds; this significant drawback can be overcome with the proposed VSP2CC strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Switches","Inverters","Rotors","Current

The effects of the temperature rise on PMSM parameters are investigated and the stator resistance change is successfully tracked with the proposed Two-Stage Single-Flock Particle Swarm Optimization method in steady-state operation condition. The simulation is based on a proper model of the PMSM, including electromagnetic and mechanical elements.

However these techniques distort motor currents, which introduce torque ripple and acoustic noise. Lower signal injection amplitude reduces torque ripple but increases position estimation error, so correct signal injection amplitude is required for satisfactory drive performance. More over signal injection amplitude required in transients is higher than steady state conditions. In this work signal amplitude is adaptively increased during transients based on rate of change of load and reduced back to original value under steady state. This work reports implementation details and simulation results of adaptive signal injection based sensor less control.

Different sensorless techniques have been proposed to estimate the rotor position using current and voltage measurements of the machine. Detection of the back-electromotive force (EMF) zero-crossing moments is one of the methods most used to achieve sensorless control by predicting the commutation moments. Most of the techniques based on this phenomenon have the inherit disadvantage of an indirect detection of commutation moments. This is the result of the commutation moment occurring 30 electrical degrees after the zero-crossing of the induced back-emf in the unexcited phase. Often, the time difference between the zero crossing of the back-emf and the optimal current commutation is assumed constant. This assumption can be valid for steady-state operation, however a varying time difference should be taken into account during transient operation of the BLDC machine. This uncertainty degrades the performance of the drive during transients. To overcome this problem which improves the performance while keeping the simplicity of the back-emf zero-crossing detection method an enhancement is proposed. The proposed sensorless method operates parameterless in a way it uses none of the brushless dc-machine parameters. In this paper different aspects of experimental implementation of the new method as well as various aspects of the FPGA programming are discussed. Proposed control method is implemented within a Xilinx Spartan 3E XC3S500E board.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives and Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (SLED/PRECEDE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678915/6684473/06684524.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Sensorless Control for Electrical Drives and Predictive Control of Electrical Drives and Power Electronics (SLED/PRECEDE)","doi":"10.1109/SLED-PRECEDE.2013.6684524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SLED-PRECEDE.2013.6684524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based implementation of the back-EMF symmetric-threshold-tracking sensorless commutation method for Brushless DC-machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Commutation","Voltage measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Inverters","Delays","Rotors","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","electric potential","field programmable gate arrays","permanent magnet motors","sensorless machine control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Spartan 3E XC3S500E board","FPGA programming","BLDC machine","current commutation","sensorless control","EMF zero-crossing moments","current measurements","voltage measurements","rotor position estimate","sensorless techniques","back-electromotive force","brushless DC permanent-magnet machines","back-EMF symmetric-threshold-tracking sensorless commutation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Permanent-magnet brushless DC-machine (BLDC-machine)","back-EMF zero-crossing","sensorless control","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based implementation of the back-EMF symmetric-threshold-tracking sensorless commutation method for Brushless DC-machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684524/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974499","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based implementation of the back-EMF symmetric-threshold-tracking sensorless commutation method for Brushless DC-machines","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"s71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056669S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678915","isNumber":"6684473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678915","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6684473","articleId":"6684524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6684527,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Pernici","affiliation":["Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC), University of Florence, Florence, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6940341/6684527/perni-250-small.gif","p":["Federico Pernici received the laurea degree in information engineering in 2002, the post-laurea degree in internet engineering in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in information and telecommunications engineering in 2005, from the University of Florence, Florence, Italy.

To this end, we use multiple instances of scale invariant local features weakly aligned along the object template. This allows taking into account the 3D shape deviations from planarity and their interactions with shadows, occlusions, and sensor quantization for which no invariant representations can be defined. A non-parametric learning algorithm based on the transitive matching property discriminates the object from the context and prevents improper object template updating during occlusion. We show that our learning rule has asymptotic stability under mild conditions and confirms the drift-free capability of the method in long-term tracking. A real-time implementation of the ALIEN tracker has been evaluated in comparison with the state-of-the-art tracking systems on an extensive set of publicly available video sequences that represent most of the critical conditions occurring in real tracking environments. We have reported superior or equal performance in most of the cases and verified tracking with no drift in very long video sequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context modeling","Feature extraction","Tracking","Search problems","Target tracking","Detectors","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image matching","image sequences","object tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object tracking","ALIEN tracking method","local invariant representations","robust object/context discriminative classifier","scale invariant local features","object template","3D shape deviations","occlusions","sensor quantization","nonparametric learning algorithm","transitive matching","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tracking","Motion","Invariants","Feature representation","Computer vision"]},{"kwd":["Visual real-time tracking","long-term tracking","learning from video","local feature invariance","template update"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6940341/06684527.pdf","startPage":"2538","endPage":"2551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6940341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Tracking by Oversampling Local Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Object Tracking by Oversampling Local Features","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684527/","volume":"36","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684527/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14703163","pubMedId":"26353156","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Tracking by Oversampling Local Features","sourcePdf":"tpami-pernici-250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122907S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6940341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6940341","articleId":"6684527","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6684530,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Gupta","affiliation":["Microsoft, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6871455/6684530/gupta-184-small.gif","p":["Manish Gupta is an Applied Researcher at Microsoft Bing, Gachibowli, Hyderabad, India, and also a visiting faculty member at IIT-Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.

Moreover, mobile devices may not be willing to forward data items to other devices due to the limited resources. Hence, effective data dissemination schemes need to be designed to encourage nodes to collaboratively share data. We propose a Multi-Receiver Incentive-Based Dissemination (MuRIS) scheme that allows nodes to cooperatively deliver information of interest to one another via chosen paths utilizing few transmissions. Our scheme exploits local historical paths and users' interests information maintained by each node. In addition, the charge and rewarding functions incorporated within our scheme stimulate cooperation among nodes such that the nodes have no incentive to launch edge insertion attacks. Furthermore, our charge and rewarding functions are designed such that the chosen delivery paths mimic efficient multicast tree that results in fewer delivery hops. Extensive simulation studies using real human contact-based mobility traces show that our scheme outperforms existing methods in terms of delivery ratio and transmission efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6722871/06684544.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incentive Based Data Sharing in Delay Tolerant Mobile Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Peer-to-peer computing","Equations","Delays","Wireless communication","Ad hoc networks","Information management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay tolerant networks","information dissemination","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real human contact based mobility trace","multicast tree","MuRIS scheme","multireceiver incentive-based dissemination scheme","data dissemination scheme","mobile wireless device","delay tolerant mobile networks","incentive based data sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Incentive mechanism","publisher/subscriber","delay tolerant networks","data sharing","mobile networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Incentive Based Data Sharing in Delay Tolerant Mobile Networks","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6684544/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056249","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incentive Based Data Sharing in Delay Tolerant Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"370-tw1401-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089219S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6722871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6722871","articleId":"6684544","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6684548,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6722871/6684548/6684548-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lu Wang received her B.

As a promising solution, cognitive radio emerges and shows its advantages. It allows the unlicensed users to opportunistically access the spectrum not used by the licensed users. To ensure that the unlicensed users can identify the vacate spectrum fast and accurately without interfering the licensed users, cooperative sensing is explored to improve the sensing performance by leveraging spatial diversity. However, cooperation gain can be compromised dramatically with cooperation overhead. Furthermore, when sensing decisions are made, contention on spectrum access also contributes a lot to the control overhead, especially in the distributed networks. Motivated by this, we propose a novel MAC design, termed Frequency domain Cooperative sensing and Multi-channel contention (FCM) for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRAHNs). FCM is proposed for OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) modulation based communication systems, which moves cooperative sensing and multi-channel contention from time domain into frequency domain. Therefore, control overhead caused by cooperation and contention can be significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the sensing and access performance can be both guaranteed. Extensive simulation results show that FCM can effectively reduce the control overhead, and improve the average throughput by 220% over Traditional Cooperative MAC for CRAHNs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722871","startPage":"440","endPage":"449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6722871/06684548.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harnessing Frequency Domain for Cooperative Sensing and Multi-channel Contention in CRAHNs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684548/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Harnessing Frequency Domain for Cooperative Sensing and Multi-channel Contention in CRAHNs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056241","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harnessing Frequency Domain for Cooperative Sensing and Multi-channel Contention in CRAHNs","sourcePdf":"440-tw1401-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096357S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6722871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6722871","articleId":"6684548","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6684549,"authors":[{"name":"Indika A.

Recent studies which are based on loss systems show that maximal capacity can be achieved using dynamic CA strategies. However the channel allocation schemes suffer from high blocking and forced termination when primary users become active. In this paper, we propose to introduce queues for secondary users so that those flows that would otherwise be blocked or forcibly terminated could be buffered and possibly served later. More specifically, in a multi-channel network with heterogeneous traffic, two queues are separately allocated to real-time and elastic users and channel access opportunities are distributed between these two queues in a way that real-time services receive higher priority. Two queuing schemes are introduced based on the delay tolerance of interrupted elastic services. Furthermore, continuous time Markov chain models are developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed CA strategy with queues, and the correctness as well as the preciseness of the derived theoretical models are verified through extensive simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the integration of queues can further increase the capacity of the secondary network and spectrum utilization while decreasing blocking probability and forced termination probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14131460","htmlLink":"/document/6684549/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Assembling with Priority-Based Queues in Cognitive Radio Networks: Strategies and Performance Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Assembling with Priority-Based Queues in Cognitive Radio Networks: Strategies and Performance Evaluation","sourcePdf":"0630-tw1402-indika.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132438S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6684549","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6684550,"authors":[{"name":"Sarabjot Singh","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG), The University of Texas, Austin"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6750007/6684550/6684550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sarabjot Singh (S'09) received the B.

To achieve sufficient load balancing, the offloaded users often have much lower SINR than they would on the macrocell. This SINR degradation can be partially alleviated through interference avoidance, for example time or frequency resource partitioning, whereby the macrocell turns off in some fraction of such resources. Naturally, the optimal offloading strategy is tightly coupled with resource partitioning; the optimal amount of which in turn depends on how many users have been offloaded. In this paper, we propose a general and tractable framework for modeling and analyzing joint resource partitioning and offloading in a two-tier cellular network. With it, we are able to derive the downlink rate distribution over the entire network, and an optimal strategy for joint resource partitioning and offloading. We show that load balancing, by itself, is insufficient, and resource partitioning is required in conjunction with offloading to improve the rate of cell edge users in co-channel heterogeneous networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.120713.130548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120713.130548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06684550.pdf","startPage":"888","endPage":"901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Resource Partitioning and Offloading in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint Resource Partitioning and Offloading in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","volume":"13","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684550/","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14143562","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684550/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Resource Partitioning and Offloading in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"0888-tw1402-singh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150841S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"274","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6684550","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6684551,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Che Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6722871/6684551/6684551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Che Hung was born in Taichungh, Taiwan, in 1983.

Moreover, the analytical results show that the proposed sequence can greatly reduce the multi-cell interference (MCI) induced by carrier frequency offset (CFO) to a negligible level. Therefore, the CFO estimation algorithms designed for single-user or single-cell environments can be slightly modified, and applied in multi-cell environments; an example is given for showing how to modify the estimation algorithms. Consequently, the computational complexity can be dramatically reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed sequences and the CFO estimation algorithms outperform conventional schemes in multi-cell environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Interference","Correlation","Synchronization","Frequency-domain analysis","OFDM","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency estimation","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","sequential codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","CFO estimation algorithms","carrier frequency offset","multicell interference","multipath channels","zero autocorrelation","constant amplitude","handshaking stage","training sequence","multicell networks","interference mitigation","sequence designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sequence designs","multi-cell interference (MCI)","synchronization","OFDM","CFO estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6722871/06684551.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence Designs for Interference Mitigation in Multi-Cell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684551","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequence Designs for Interference Mitigation in Multi-Cell Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684551/","volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684551/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14056253","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence Designs for Interference Mitigation in Multi-Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"394-tw1401-hung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074606S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6722871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6722871","articleId":"6684551","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":6684553,"authors":[{"name":"Xinqian Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6722871/6684553/6684553-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinqian Xie received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Communications (BUPT), China, in 2010.

By taking advantage of the apriori information of wireless channels to further improve channel estimation accuracy, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) based estimation schemes are developed to estimate the composite source-source channel coefficients and the amplitude of individual source-relay channels with apriori knowledge of channel distribution information (CDI). Variations of MAP estimation algorithms are also developed for systems under practical constraints where channel CDI needs to be estimated. In particular, scale MAP estimator as well as a long term estimation algorithm is developed to effectively control the negative impact of CDI estimation error on MAP estimation performance. The simulation results show that the MAP based estimation strategies consistently outperform maximum likelihood estimation methods in the measure of mean square error, thus establishes the advantage of presented MAP based schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.120313.130864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6722871/06684553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120313.130864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722871","startPage":"450","endPage":"463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum a Posteriori Based Channel Estimation Strategy for Two-Way Relaying Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum a Posteriori Based Channel Estimation Strategy for Two-Way Relaying Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056255","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6684553/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum a Posteriori Based Channel Estimation Strategy for Two-Way Relaying Channels","sourcePdf":"450-tw1401-xie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118782S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6722871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6722871","articleId":"6684553","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6684555,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Shen","affiliation":["Southeast University, National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6750007/6684555/6684555-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Shen (S'11) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in information engineering from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we aim to design a robust MIMO transceiver for nonregenerative MIMO relay systems against imperfect CSI from a worst-case robust perspective. Specifically, we formulate the robust transceiver design, under the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion, as a minimax problem. Then, by decomposing the minimax problem into two subproblems with respect to the relay precoder and destination equalizer, respectively, we show that the optimal solution to each subproblem has a favorable channel-diagonalizing structure under some mild conditions. Based on this finding, we transform the two complex-matrix subproblems into their equivalent scalar forms, both of which are proven to be convex and can be efficiently solved by our proposed methods. We further propose an alternating algorithm to jointly optimize the precoder and equalizer that only requires scalar operations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed robust design is verified by simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06684555.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120413.130009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Worst-Case Robust MMSE Transceiver Design for Nonregenerative MIMO Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Transceivers","Relays","MIMO","Equalizers","Optimization","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","minimax techniques","precoding","radio transceivers","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst case robust MMSE transceiver design","nonregenerative MIMO relaying","MIMO relay systems","imperfect channel state information","MIMO transceiver","robust transceiver design","minimum mean squared error criterion","minimax problem","relay precoder","destination equalizer","channel diagonalizing structure","complex matrix subproblems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems","minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)","worst-case transceiver design","imperfect channel state information (CSI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Worst-Case Robust MMSE Transceiver Design for Nonregenerative MIMO Relaying","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6684555/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14131466","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Worst-Case Robust MMSE Transceiver Design for Nonregenerative MIMO Relaying","sourcePdf":"0695-tw1402-shen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217098S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6684555","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6684556,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Yuan","affiliation":["Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing, School of Engineering & Physical Sciences Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6722871/6684556/6684556-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Yuan received the BSc degree with distinction in Electronic Engineering from Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 2006 and MSc degree with distinction in Mobile Communications from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K., in 2009.

The proposed RS-GBSM, combining line-of-sight (LoS) components, a two-sphere model, and an elliptic-cylinder model, has the ability to study the impact of the vehicular traffic density (VTD) on channel statistics, and jointly considers the azimuth and elevation angles by using the von Mises Fisher distribution. Moreover, a novel parameter computation method is proposed for jointly calculating the azimuth and elevation angles in the SoS channel simulator. Based on the proposed 3D theoretical RS-GBSM and its SoS simulation model, statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated. The impact of the elevation angle in the 3D model on key statistical properties is investigated by comparing with those of the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) model. It is demonstrated that the 3D model is more accurate to characterize real V2V channels, in particular for pico cell scenarios. Finally, close agreement is achieved between the theoretical model, SoS simulation model, and simulation results, demonstrating the utility of the proposed models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel 3D Geometry-Based Stochastic Models for Non-Isotropic MIMO Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.120313.130434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6722871/06684556.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.120313.130434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","displayDocTitle":"Novel 3D Geometry-Based Stochastic Models for Non-Isotropic MIMO Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6684556/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056240","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel 3D Geometry-Based Stochastic Models for Non-Isotropic MIMO Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channels","sourcePdf":"298-tw1401-yuan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142782S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6722871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6722871","articleId":"6684556","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6684558,"authors":[{"name":"Haitong Li","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haitong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085344311"},{"name":"Peng Huang","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Huang","id":"38240539000"},{"name":"Bin Gao","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37399191900"},{"name":"Bing Chen","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539161700"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Liu","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280578200"},{"name":"Jinfeng Kang","affiliation":["Peking University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinfeng","lastName":"Kang","id":"37273713100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6684558","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3448},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684558","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Integrated circuit modeling","SPICE","Resistance","Microprocessors","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage currents","random-access storage","SPICE","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SPICE model","large-scale memory array simulation","oxide-based resistive random access memory RRAM","dc behavior","transient behavior","conductive filament evolution","large-scale array","one transistor-one resistor RRAM array","wire resistance","wire capacitance","resistance-capacitance delay","RESET","leakage current","power dissipation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit simulation","memory array","power dissipation","resistive random access memory (RRAM)","SPICE model"]}],"abstract":"A SPICE model of oxide-based resistive random access memory (RRAM) for dc and transient behaviors is developed based on the conductive filament evolution model and is implemented in large-scale array simulation.

In this configuration, the Raman and Parametric processes are separated and each one takes place in a separate span of fiber, allowing for optimization of amplification gain (e.g., > 20 dB), gain bandwidth (e.g., 170 nm) and gain ripple (e.g., <; 4 dB). We also focus on the potential signal degradation performance due to the generation of idlers within the operational bandwidth. To overcome this limitation, we propose and model a modified HROPA design, which allows for the management and the suppression of idlers in the amplifier. The idler suppression is achieved through partitioning the channels in two sub-bands and using a wavelength-division multiplexed DEMUM/MUX pair to limit/suppress the idlers, as well as crosstalk terms generated in the amplifier. Our study shows that with proper selection of pump wavelength and power and engineering the HROPA with correct filter transfer function, we can achieve error free performance even in the case when significant misalignment of the transmitter wavelength from the center of the coarse WDM channel band exists.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684559/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","publicationDate":"March1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14031774","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Engineering an Extended Gain Bandwidth Hybrid Raman\u2014Optical Parametric Amplifier for Next Generation CWDM PON","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-0901563"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Engineering an Extended Gain Bandwidth Hybrid Raman\u2014Optical Parametric Amplifier for Next Generation CWDM PON","sourcePdf":"jlt-peiris-2295176-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086777S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6710256","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6710256","articleId":"6684559","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6684563,"authors":[{"name":"Fangcheng Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6850100/6684563/6684563-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fangcheng Liu (S\u201911) was born in China.

In this paper, the stability issues of Z + Z type cascade systems in HESS are focused. The stability issues of cascade systems have been studied for many years. Impedance ratio type criterions in the form of ZS/ZL or ZL/ZS have been proposed to solve these stability issues. However, existing ratio type criteria still have problems in some cascade systems. The terminal characteristics of submodule are studied and the different types of cascade system are defined in this paper. The validity of conventional impedance ratio type criterion would be influenced by the right-half-plane zeros (RHZ) in terminal impedance of submodules in the Z + Z type cascade system. Two improved criteria are proposed for the Z + Z type cascade system: one is improved ratio type criterion considering the RHZ in the terminal impedance of the submodule; the other one is sum type criterion which does not need the information about RHZ in terminal impedance of each submodule. Experimental evidences are provided to prove the validity of these two improved criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2295259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6850100/06684563.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2295259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850100","startPage":"5846","endPage":"5859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Issues of - Type Cascade System in Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability Issues of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Z + Z$</tex></formula> Type Cascade System in Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684563/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14429998","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6684563/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Issues of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Z + Z$</tex></formula> Type Cascade System in Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2295259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180022S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6850100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6850100","articleId":"6684563","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6684570,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Bijamov","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6750065/6684570/6684570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alex Bijamov received the B.S. degree in physics from Tbilisi State University, Tbilisi, Georgia, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in engineering sciences from Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA, in 2011.","From 2011 and 2012, he was a Research Associate with Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, where he developed advanced models for electromagnetic-induction-based target detection and classification, and worked on statistical signal processing.

Unlike other classification techniques, which often rely on library matching or expert knowledge, our combined clustering/Gaussian-mixture-model approach first uses the inherent properties of the data in feature space to build a custom training list that is then used to score all unknown targets by assigning them a likelihood of being UXO. The ground truth for the most likely candidates is then requested and used to correct the model parameters and reassign the scores. The process is repeated several times until the desired statistical margin is reached, at which point a final dig is produced. Our method could decrease intervention by human experts and, as the results of the blind test show, identify all targets of interest correctly while minimizing false-alarm counts.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2287510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2287510","startPage":"5218","endPage":"5229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6750065/06684570.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camp Butner Live-Site UXO Classification Using Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Camp Butner Live-Site UXO Classification Using Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Modeling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2014","volume":"52","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684570/","accessionNumber":"14131346","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684570/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"MR-1572"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Camp Butner Live-Site UXO Classification Using Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Modeling","sourcePdf":"tgrs-shubitidze-2287510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10321S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6750065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6750065","articleId":"6684570","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6684571,"authors":[{"name":"Isik C.

The Sobel operator is applied to detect the gradient magnitude and direction of each fraction image at each coarse-resolution pixel. The gradient direction is used to determine the direction of subpixel spatial dependence. The gradient magnitude is used to determine the weights of neighboring subpixels in the neighborhood system. The HNNA was examined on synthetic images with artificial shapes, a synthetic IKONOS image, and a real Landsat multispectral image.

In this paper, we develop a decision directed estimation (DDE) algorithm to know the effects of charge leakage in NAND flash memory using the error pattern of the accessed data. While the conventional sensing directed estimation (SDE) method demands extra memory sensing to know the signal distribution, the proposed DDE algorithm induces no sensing overheads. The proposed algorithm approximates the threshold voltage distribution as a Gaussian mixture and also assumes that the increase of standard deviation is linearly proportional to the amount of mean shift. Since the threshold voltage distribution in real devices is not a perfect Gaussian mixture, we conduct error analysis of the proposed algorithm to examine the sources of estimation errors and quantify their impact on the estimation accuracy. We also present a combined estimation scheme that employs the DDE and the SDE algorithms to minimize the number of memory sensing operations while maintaining high estimation accuracy. The developed algorithm is applied to both simulated and real NAND flash memory, and the estimation errors are measured.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2295056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06684584.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2295056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision Directed Estimation of Threshold Voltage Distribution in NAND Flash Memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Decision Directed Estimation of Threshold Voltage Distribution in NAND Flash Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684584/","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14056598","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684584/","volume":"62","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision Directed Estimation of Threshold Voltage Distribution in NAND Flash Memory","sourcePdf":"tsp-sung-2295056-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127356S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6684584","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6684585,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Pandey","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rahul Pandey received the bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from IIT, Kanpur, India, in 2010.

Using numerical simulations, random telegraph noise (RTN) amplitude induced by a single charge trap is investigated with regard to trap location, electron band-to-band-generation rate, bias, and transistor size. It is found that HTFET RTN amplitude does not scale inversely with gate length and is governed by tunneling distance of carriers at source-channel junction. HTFET exhibits 40% less relative RTN amplitude at 0.3 V at gate lengths around 20 nm, over subthreshold Si-FinFET. RTN of HTFET at VGS=0 V is higher for a trap location at source-channel tunnel junction. To analyze flicker, shot, and thermal noise, we created transistor level Verilog-A-based electrical noise models. The results indicate HTFETs competitive noise performance in megahertz frequency range, over Si-FinFET. In the range 10 GHz or more with operating voltages exceeding 0.3 V, HTFET input noise is worse due to the dominance of shot noise. A differential amplifier with active load is used to examine the electrical noise performance at circuit level. We emphasize that high intrinsic gain, drive current, and output resistance of HTFET can be used to achieve superior mixed signal performance metrics in HTFET design over Si-FinFET design, at an improved electrical noise performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Noise in Heterojunction Interband Tunnel FETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron

Direct-Conversion Receivers","abstract":"Software-defined radio technology is experiencing more and more attention in modern communication and radar systems. The main practical challenge in deploying such technology is related to achieving sufficient linearity and spurious-free dynamic range in the RF front-end, especially in low-cost mass-product devices. This paper focuses on the analysis and digital mitigation of nonlinear distortion in software-define radio devices, building on wideband multicarrier/multiradio direct-conversion receiver principle where a wide collection of radio frequencies is in-phase/quadrature down-converted as a whole. A complete behavioral model for the total nonlinear distortion of the whole receiver chain is first derived, taking into account the third-order nonlinear distortion effects in all individual components, namely, RF low-noise amplifier, in-phase/quadrature mixer, and baseband in-phase/quadrature amplifiers. Stemming from this modeling, an adaptive digital feed-forward linearization structure is then developed to efficiently mitigate the joint nonlinear distortion of the whole receiver. The effectiveness of this approach is verified through extensive simulations and actual RF system measurements with a commercially available software-defined radio platform, which clearly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods that do not jointly consider RF and baseband nonlinearities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998040","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Mitigation of Nonlinear RF and Baseband Distortions in Wideband Direct-Conversion Receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Mitigation of Nonlinear RF and Baseband Distortions in Wideband Direct-Conversion Receivers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-grimm-2292603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04771S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"6701340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"50","articleId":"6684589","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6684591,"authors":[{"name":"Zuohua Ding","affiliation":["Lab of Intelligent Computing and Software Engineering, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7000614/6684591/6684591-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zuohua Ding (M'11) received the Ph.D. degree in mathematics and M.S. degree in computer science from the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA, in 1996 and 1998, respectively.","He is currently a Professor and the Director of the Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Software Engineering, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Hangzhou, China, and has been a Research Professor at the National Institute for Systems Test and Productivity, USA, since 2001.

To do so, we propose first an analytical solution of the optimum switching frequency to maximize the converter efficiency. When the parasitic capacitances are low, this solution leads to an identical contribution of the switches and transfer capacitors to the converter output impedance. As the parasitic capacitances increase, the optimum switching frequency decreases. Secondly, optimum capacitor and switch sizes for maximum efficiency are provided. We show that the overdrive voltage strongly impacts the optimum switch width through the modification of their conductance. To support the sizing methodology, a model of the efficiency of switched-capacitor DC/DC converters is developed. It is validated against simulation and measurement results in 65 nm and 0.13 \u03bcm CMOS, respectively. The proposed sizing methodology shows how the converter efficiency can be traded-off for die area reduction and what is the impact of parasitic capacitances on the converter sizing.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2285692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6805240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2285692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6805240/06684601.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sizing Methodology for On-Chip Switched-Capacitor DC/DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Sizing Methodology for On-Chip Switched-Capacitor DC/DC Converters","volume":"61","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684601/","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14265381","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684601/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sizing Methodology for On-Chip Switched-Capacitor DC/DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-devos-2285692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143523S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6805240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6805240","articleId":"6684601","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6684603,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwen Zhu","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6820808/6684603/6684603-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiwen Zhu (M'04\u2013SM'13) received the B.Eng. degree from the East China Institute of Technology (ECIT), Nanjing, China, in 1991 and the Ph.D. degree from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1997, both in electrical engineering.","From 1991 to 1992, he was a Research Engineer in the Department of Electrical Engineering, ECIT.

Product type splitting property refers to the case where each customer order consists of several product types and the workload of all associated product types can be arbitrarily split among machines. The objective is to minimize the total completion time of the orders. Several optimality properties of the general problem are derived. Based on these properties, an easily computable lower bound of the objective function is established. Two important special cases are further explored. Three heuristics are proposed to solve the general problem. It is shown that the worst case performances of all the three heuristics are bounded by simple functions of makespan related measures. Numerical studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the lower bound and heuristics. Additional insights are offered by comparison studies focusing on the computational efficiency of the heuristics proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14836001","volume":"12","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6684604/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Customer Order Scheduling on Unrelated Parallel Machines to Minimize Total Completion Time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customer Order Scheduling on Unrelated Parallel Machines to Minimize Total Completion Time","sourcePdf":"tase-xu-2291899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7000614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7000614","articleId":"6684604","onlineDate":"16 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6684605,"authors":[{"name":"Michel P.

While generation and transmission networks already use a considerable number of automation and measurement devices, a large number of smart monitors and meters are to be deployed in the distribution network to allow broad observability and real-time monitoring. This situation creates new requirements concerning the communication interface, computational intelligence and the ability to process data or signals and also to share information. Therefore, a considerable increase in data exchange and in storage is likely to occur. In this context, one must achieve an efficient use of channel communication bandwidth and a reduced need of storage space for power system data. Here, we review the main compression techniques devised for electric signal waveforms providing an overview of the achievements obtained in the past decades. Additionally, we envision some smart grid scenarios emphasizing open research issues regarding compression of electric signal waveforms. We expect that this paper will contribute to motivate joint research efforts between electrical power system and signal processing communities in the area of signal waveform compression.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6693741/06684605.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

industrialized nation in the world. As the utility grid ages and the demand for electricity grows, the impact of major interruptions of the electricity infrastructure will be more intense. Costly power outages throughout the world caused by natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes have highlighted the importance of reinforcing the electricity infrastructure. A recent study conducted for the U.S. Department of Energy indicated that sustained power interruptions (those lasting more than 5 min) in the United States incur costs of more than US$26 billion dollars annually. Power outages caused by Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina in the United States threw into notice the crucial role of smart grid technology and the need for further investments in more comprehensive data communication and distribution management systems, distributed energy resources, energy storage facilities, additional automation, and further migration toward decentralized operations for the largely centralized power grid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","volume":"12","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13976988","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6684680/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Only Connect: Microgrids for Distribution System Restoration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Only Connect: Microgrids for Distribution System Restoration","sourcePdf":"12mpe01-che-2286317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046047S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8014","isNumber":"6684621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8014","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6684621","articleId":"6684680","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6684716,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Oborina","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Oborina","id":"37394030700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-6037-66-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-6037-65-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6684716","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Fading","System performance","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)","velocity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system performance","mobility scenarios","3GPP LTE DL","ergodic system capacity","moment generating function","MGF","post-processed SINR","channel impairments","mobile velocity","velocity 3 km/h","velocity 10 km/h","velocity 30 km/h","velocity 60 km/h","velocity 80 km/h","velocity 120 km/h"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobility","velocity","ergodic capacity","effective SINR","LTE","system level simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684716","abstract":"This paper investigates the impact of the mobility to the system performance in different mobility scenarios in 3GPP LTE DL.

The system simulations results in realistic mobility scenarios with 3, 10, 30, 60, 80 and 120 km per hour in LTE DL network confirm an clear impact of the mobile velocity to the ergodic system capacity and demonstrate about 25% loss in system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICECom.2013.6684716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECom.2013.6684716","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECom 2013","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679356/6684704/06684716.pdf","publicationTitle":"ICECom 2013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of mobile velocity on the system capacity in LTE DL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Effect of mobile velocity on the system capacity in LTE DL","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684716/","accessionNumber":"13978564","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684716/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of mobile velocity on the system capacity in LTE DL","confLoc":"Dubrovnik, Croatia","sourcePdf":"s124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053731S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679356","isNumber":"6684704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679356","xplore-issue":"6684704","articleId":"6684716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"KoREMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6684717,"authors":[{"name":"Erwin H.

The production these antennas for wireless communication is focused to design efficient, wide band, antennas that easily can be incorporated into various systems. Design parameters of microstrip antenna need to be calculated in very high accuracy to ensure proper functioning. Design of the rectangular or circular microstrip patch antenna requires high accuracy of calculations, and it is not so easy task. The known models (transmission line model or cavity model) give less accurate results. Simulations based on full-wave analysis techniques, such as CST Studio SuiteTM, enable more accurate analysis of microstrip antenna characteristics, but they suffer from time consuming, intensive computations. Demand for fast and enough accurate computations can be satisfied using neural network models. This work studies microstrip patch antenna design using artificial neural network optimized by PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm. According to neural network design results an antenna was made. The calculated and neural network results are compared with measured antenna values.","doi":"10.1109/ICECom.2013.6684759","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679356/6684704/06684759.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"ICECom 2013","publicationTitle":"ICECom 2013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECom.2013.6684759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstrip antenna design using neural networks optimized by PSO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Microstrip antenna design using neural networks optimized by PSO","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13990427","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6684759/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microstrip antenna design using neural networks optimized by PSO","confLoc":"Dubrovnik, Croatia","sourcePdf":"s335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119485S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679356","isNumber":"6684704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679356","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6684704","articleId":"6684759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"KoREMA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6684860,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Technology Systems, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37653920600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5261-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-5848"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-634X"}],"articleNumber":"6684860","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":674},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Educational institutions","Green products","Materials","Virtual machine monitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer aided instruction","computer science education","educational courses","educational institutions","public domain software","teaching","virtual instrumentation","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable virtual lab modules","cloud computing concept teaching","cloud computing skills teaching","virtual machines","educational courses","centralized virtual labs","decentralized virtual labs","open source cloud infrastructures","educational institutions","Google App Engine","EC2","Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","public cloud services","information technology application delivery","information technology resource delivery","highly-scalable model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","virtualization","virtual laboratory","online education"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is a highly scalable model for delivering information technology resources and applications, on demand, as a service, to end users through the network. In recent years, cloud computing has been adopted rapidly and extensively in industry. Notable public cloud services include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Google App Engine, among others. There is a fast growing demand for professionals with cloud computing skills. However, the demand is not being fulfilled, partially due to the inability of educational institutions to keep up with technological advancements, as well as a lack of hands-on educational material. We have been developing portable virtual lab modules which can be used to teach basic cloud computing concepts and skills early and often. The labs run on virtual machines and can be ported between different courses and between different platforms. The virtual labs can be deployed in centralized or decentralized ways. To meet the learning outcomes, the students are expected to: (1) comprehend the fundamental concepts of cloud computing; (2) identify the building blocks of cloud computing systems; (3) understand the basic operation of open source cloud infrastructures; and (4) recognize commonly used, commercial cloud computing services and applications.","doi":"10.1109/FIE.2013.6684860","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679339/6684765/06684860.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2013.6684860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Portable lab modules on cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6684860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6684860/","displayDocTitle":"Portable lab modules on cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13978178","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6684860/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Portable lab modules on cloud computing","confLoc":"Oklahoma City, OK, USA","sourcePdf":"1569723037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039107S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679339","isNumber":"6684765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679339","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6684765","articleId":"6684860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685012,"authors":[{"name":"Melody Moh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, San Jos\u00e9 State University, San Jos\u00e9, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Melody","lastName":"Moh","id":"38182269400"},{"name":"Rafael Alvarez-Horine","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, San Jos\u00e9 State University, San Jos\u00e9, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Alvarez-Horine","id":"37061307300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5261-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-5848"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-634X"}],"articleNumber":"6685012","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"abstract":"Modern web-based services increasingly have a cloud-based component, which only in recent years has been studied in an academic manner.

To that end we present a cloud computing class that through the use of labs, presentations, and research projects, integrates practical hands-on experiences with academic research. The labs not only deploy to multiple public cloud environments, but also walk students through the process of creating, configuring, and maintaining their own private clouds.

Thereby, a trade-off between maximum array dimension, element spacing and hardware efforts exists. In terms of estimating the direction of arrival, the covariance matrix of the array element signals plays an important role. Here, minimum redundancy arrays aim at a hardware reduction with signal reconstruction by exploiting the Toeplitz characteristics of the covariance matrix. However, the discrete spatial convolution complicates the finding of an optimal antenna setup with minimum redundancy. Combinatorial effort is the consequence. This paper presents a possible simplified algorithm in order to find MIMO array setups of maximum dimension with minimum redundancy.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685236","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679354/6685224/06685236.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A design-algorithm for MIMO radar antenna setups with minimum redundancy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685236/","displayDocTitle":"A design-algorithm for MIMO radar antenna setups with minimum redundancy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13978539","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685236/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A design-algorithm for MIMO radar antenna setups with minimum redundancy","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049882S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679354","isNumber":"6685224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679354","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6685224","articleId":"6685236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685246,"authors":[{"name":"Charles F.

LEDs have a limited operating voltage range and the voltage-current characteristic shows a nonlinear behavior. When an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is used to drive these transmitter LEDs (VLC-OFDM), LED chip overheating and nonlinear distortions occur, due to high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signal. Unlike radio frequency baseband communication systems, the VLC-OFDM signal is a real-valued signal. This would lend itself to the PAPR reduction in VLC-OFDM. In this paper, we propose to use exponential nonlinear companding transformation techniques in VLC-OFDM to reduce the PAPR. Simulation results demonstrate that with the exponential companding function employed in VLC-OFDM, the PAPR of the VLC-OFDM is significantly reduced, compared with previously considered methods.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685269","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679354/6685224/06685269.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduced OFDM visible light communication using exponential nonlinear companding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685269/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduced OFDM visible light communication using exponential nonlinear companding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13978495","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685269/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduced OFDM visible light communication using exponential nonlinear companding","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052677S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679354","isNumber":"6685224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679354","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6685224","articleId":"6685269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685279,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Gotthans","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, ESIEE, France"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Gotthans","id":"37704291000"},{"name":"Genevi\u00e8ve Baudoin","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, ESIEE, France"],"firstName":"Genevi\u00e8ve","lastName":"Baudoin","id":"37277494700"},{"name":"Amadou Mbaye","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, ESIEE, France"],"firstName":"Amadou","lastName":"Mbaye","id":"38467643600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685279","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Complexity theory","Polynomials","Predistortion","Mathematical model","Numerical models","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","integer programming","polynomials","power amplifiers","Volterra series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal order estimation","digital baseband predistortion","Volterra series","integer genetic algorithm","polynomial series","power amplifier modeling","power amplifier predistortion","fitness function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685279","abstract":"Power amplifier is an essential component in communication systems. Digital baseband predistortion is a cost effective approach to linearize a power amplifier. Models derived from Volterra series are often used. For a given type of model, two questions have to be solved: estimation of the model coefficients, and determination of the model structure, e.g. orders of non-linearity, memory lengths, etc. There have been many works on the estimation of model coefficients but few works have focused on the determination of the model structure. To choose proper orders of series is not evident in order to keep low complexity with acceptable results. In the article, we propose to use an integer genetic algorithm for the determination of orders of polynomial series for predistortion or power amplifier modeling. The used fitness function aims to achieve a compromise between accuracy and complexity of the model. The method is evaluated on real measured power amplifier. The obtained results show that the proposed integer genetic algorithm is able to determine in a very small number of iterations a good model structure. Its complexity is quite low and it can be applied whether offline or online for adaptive determination of the structure.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685279","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685224","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679354/6685224/06685279.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal order estimation for modeling and predistortion of power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685279/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal order estimation for modeling and predistortion of power amplifiers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685279/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13978518","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal order estimation for modeling and predistortion of power amplifiers","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045546S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679354","isNumber":"6685224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679354","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6685224","articleId":"6685279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6685285,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The computational complexity is reduced by up to 60%. Such CS solution uses a fixed size measurement matrix chosen to offer a compromise between the processing overhead and signals acquisition success level. This paper proposes a dynamic acquisition algorithm for GPS signals based on CS. Instead of using a fixed size sampling channels and fixed correlators in the measurement matrix, our DSCR dynamically changes the number and size of the required Channels/Correlators according to the received GPS signals power during acquisition. This adaptive solution offers better fix capability when the GPS receiver is located in harsh signal environment or it will save valuable processing/decoding time (battery power, especially for Smartphones) when the receiver outdoors. A feedback loop is devised to control the sampling channels number and resize the measurement matrix.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685295","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronic Systems (COMCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679354/6685224/06685295.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2013.6685295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DCSR: A dynamic channel and resolution sampling for a Compressive Sensing receiver to acquire GPS signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685295/","displayDocTitle":"DCSR: A dynamic channel and resolution sampling for a Compressive Sensing receiver to acquire GPS signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13978501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685295/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DCSR: A dynamic channel and resolution sampling for a Compressive Sensing receiver to acquire GPS signals","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044597S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679354","isNumber":"6685224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679354","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6685224","articleId":"6685295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6685302,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Heller","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Heller","id":"37085812867"},{"name":"Emanuel Cohen","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Emanuel","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37399532700"},{"name":"Eran Socher","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Socher","id":"37371220200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685302","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":882},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","MMICs","Gallium nitride","Gain","Power measurement","Field effect transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","cores","field effect MIMIC","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave amplifiers","Q-factor","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["W-band LNA","cross coupled common source cores","cross-coupling capacitance","millimeter wave common source","CMOS process","bulk-CMOS cores","transformer geometry","quality factor","size 28 nm","frequency 70 GHz to 110 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mm-wave","neutralization","cross-coupling","low-noise","common-source","quality factor","noise correlation","noise sensitivity","Bode-Fano","non-equiangular transformers"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the constraints set by device dimensions and cross-coupling capacitance on the power gain, bandwidth, and noise performance of millimeter-wave common-source pairs fabricated in CMOS processes.

This scheduling problem belongs to the family of scheduling with time windows, and besides complexities of classical scheduling problems, it has additional requirements that make it over-constrained and challenging to solve to optimality. In fact, in some cases it is even hard to find a feasible solution that satisfies all user requirements and resource constraints. As with other computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems, heuristic solutions are employed to find high quality solutions in reasonable amount of computation time. In this paper we present a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm for the problem, which is a local search based algorithm that simulates the cooling process by gradually lowering the temperature of the system until it converges to a stable state. The Satellite Toolkit is used for the experimental study and performance evaluation of the algorithm through a family of instances of small, medium and large sizes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685372/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13990973","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685372/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Ground Station Scheduling Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Ground Station Scheduling Problem","confLoc":"Seo-gu, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"2510a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067132S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6684444","isNumber":"6685323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6684444","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6685323","articleId":"6685372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":6685386,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Valeros Bernardo","affiliation":["Db2Powerhouse Global Research Institute"],"firstName":"Danilo Valeros","lastName":"Bernardo","id":"37397905500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2510-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2509-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0418"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0426"}],"articleNumber":"6685386","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Organizations","Software as a service","Risk management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asset management","cloud computing","cost reduction","risk management","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing service management","security risk approach","strategic ICT agenda","Internet","information sharing","ICT asset transfer","cost reduction agenda","predefined contractual terms","security threats","acceptable measures","governance","risk management","SRA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Probability","SRA","Cloud Computing Services","CSPDDOS","XML","HX-DDOS","Risks","Security"]}],"abstract":"There is no doubt that Cloud Computing (CC) introduces opportunities that mobilize new strategic ICT agenda across organizations.

IEEE802.11p or ARIB STD-T109 in Japan are widely developed because autonomous distributed networks are easily made by using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) MAC protocol. However, the hidden terminals in CSMA networks cause the performance degradation. In our previous study, a new IVC scheme using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) had been proposed to mitigate the impact of hidden terminals and evaluated the performance in the simple straight road model. However, performances of both IVC schemes are not evaluated in the urban area road model assuming multipath fading. In this paper, performances of the DS-CDMA IVC scheme and CSMA/OFDM IVC scheme are evaluated in urban area road model. As the results of simulations, it was confirmed that the PER (Packet Error Rate) performances of CSMA/OFDM IVC can be made better than the DS-CDMA. On the other hand, DS-CDMA shows the possibility that it is able to achieve a low delay communication as compared with CSMA/OFDM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of DS-CDMA IVC scheme and CSMA/OFDM IVC scheme","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2013.6685516","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678913/6685509/06685516.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2013.6685516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of DS-CDMA IVC scheme and CSMA/OFDM IVC scheme","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685516/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977435","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of DS-CDMA IVC scheme and CSMA/OFDM IVC scheme","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"1569821881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063449S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678913","isNumber":"6685509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678913","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6685509","articleId":"6685516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685545,"authors":[{"name":"Taimoor Abbas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Taimoor","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37717501800"},{"name":"Andreas Thiel","affiliation":["Delphi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Salzdetfurth, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Thiel","id":"37531062800"},{"name":"Thomas Zemen","affiliation":["Forschungszentrum Telekommunikation Wien (FTW), Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zemen","id":"37268211000"},{"name":"Christoph F.

It is found that the model can be made more general if an intersection dependent parameter, that depends on the property and number of available scatterers in that particular intersection, is included in the model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of a non-line-of-sight path-loss model for V2V communications at street intersections","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2013.6685545","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678913/6685509/06685545.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2013.6685545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Validation of a non-line-of-sight path-loss model for V2V communications at street intersections","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685545/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977455","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of a non-line-of-sight path-loss model for V2V communications at street intersections","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"1569823525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064787S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678913","isNumber":"6685509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678913","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6685509","articleId":"6685545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6685556,"authors":[{"name":"Arturs Aboltins","affiliation":["Institute of radio electronics, Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Arturs","lastName":"Aboltins","id":"38526485200"},{"name":"Peteris Misans","affiliation":["Institute of radio electronics, Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Peteris","lastName":"Misans","id":"37662102900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0846-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685556","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Silicon","Vectors","Communication systems","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized unitary rotation","synchronization sequences","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM signal","frequency resources","channel estimation","pilot signal assisted modulation","PSAM","frequency domain equalization","Monte Carlo computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["communication systems","correlation","estimation","OFDM modulation","sequences","signal processing algorithms"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for obtaining an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a super-imposed synchronization sequence, which is orthogonal to the rest of the signal.

The proposed precoder is based on a new class of fast unitary transformations and it is compatible with classic OFDM systems with pilot signal assisted modulation (PSAM) and frequency domain equalization. Moreover, it can be used in conjunction with existing OFDM timing offset and carrier frequency synchronization methods. The impact of frequency domain equalization on the orthogonality between the synchronization sequence and data subcarriers is analyzed.

In spectrum shared multi-hop vehicular networks, each link has different signal to noise ratio (SNR) because of different distance of vehicles and avoiding interference toward a primary user (PU). In addition, since a vehicle has high mobility, SNR is dynamically changed in a short time. Therefore, the end-to-end throughput is fluctuated in a short time and it is difficult to establish stable communication by using multi-hop wireless networks. In order to solve this problem, we propose a utilization of vehicle mobility information (e.g. position, direction, and speed) to predict the link throughput of multi-hop networks with sharing the spectrum with PU. The spectrum of each link is assigned by using the result of throughput prediction of the end-to-end links. By using computer simulations, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in term of end-to-end throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13977477","htmlLink":"/document/6685560/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing between IVC and RVC in multihop vehicular cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing between IVC and RVC in multihop vehicular cognitive radio","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"1569823325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047386S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678913","isNumber":"6685509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678913","xplore-issue":"6685509","articleId":"6685560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6685561,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Theodorakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Theodorakopoulos","id":"37086733610"},{"name":"Panagiotis Papaioannou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Papaioannou","id":"37086729795"},{"name":"Taimoor Abbas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Taimoor","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37717501800"},{"name":"Fredrik Tufvesson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Tufvesson","id":"37296876300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0846-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685561","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Manganese","Scattering","MIMO","Antenna arrays","Buildings","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","fading channels","MIMO communication","multipath channels","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry based stochastic model","MIMO V2V channel simulation","cross-junction scattering environments","MIMO V2V fading channels","path-loss model","time-variant transfer function","multipath components","angle-of-departures","angle-of-arrivals","receiver","transmitter","double bounce reflections","side walls","single bounce reflections","line-of-sight","propagation process","T-junction","urban cross-junction scenario","vehicle-to-vehicle communication channels","multiple-input multiple-output simulation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) simulation model for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channels in an urban cross-junction scenario is presented. The model is an extension and modification of an existing T-junction model in the literature. Four propagation processes are considered: line-of-sight (LOS), single bounce reflections from side walls, double bounce reflections from side walls, and single bounce reflections from the corner of the building in front of the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). Each propagation process is linked to a cluster of scatterers, with a cluster size that varies with respect to the position of the TX and RX. The relations between angle-of-arrivals and angle-of-departures of all Multipath Components (MPCs) are derived depending on the different positions of the TX and RX. For the single bounce reflections from the corner a new method is being used where the scatterers are distributed randomly in a triangular plane, based on the assumption that corners of buildings typically have different scattering objects contributing to the reflection process. A complete expression for the time-variant transfer function is then derived by super positioning all contributions, including the LOS when this is available. The final results show that our model follows a realistic measurement based path-loss model, which subsequently makes the model a suitable candidate for analyzing MIMO V2V fading channels in cross-junction scattering environments.","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2013.6685561","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678913/6685509/06685561.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2013.6685561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A geometry based stochastic model for MIMO V2V channel simulation in cross-junction scenario","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685561/","displayDocTitle":"A geometry based stochastic model for MIMO V2V channel simulation in cross-junction scenario","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977447","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685561/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A geometry based stochastic model for MIMO V2V channel simulation in cross-junction scenario","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"1569823529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07031S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678913","isNumber":"6685509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678913","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6685509","articleId":"6685561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6685573,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Kalakech","affiliation":["Univ Lille Nord de France"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kalakech","id":"37273078000"},{"name":"Marion Berbineau","affiliation":["Univ Lille Nord de France"],"firstName":"Marion","lastName":"Berbineau","id":"37419455700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0846-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685573","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Estimation","Bit error rate","Decoding","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","channel estimation","cognitive radio","electromagnetic wave scattering","equalisers","fast Fourier transforms","hyperbolic equations","interpolation","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","railway communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM frequency domain channel matrix","channel simulator","mathematical analysis","off-diagonal elements","FFT interpolation technique","iterative least square estimation","sparse pilot distribution","sliding window discrete optimisation procedure","performance improvement","suboptimal linear minimum mean square channel equalisation technique","LMMSE","wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channel assumption","WSSUS","orthogonal frequency division multiplex","LTE rails","cognitive radio-for-rails","Long Term Evolution","fast Fourier transform","OFDM subcarriers","mobile terminal","broadband railway communication problems","OFDM systems","hyperbolic modelling","rapid changing channel equalisation","rapid changing channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Recently, OFDM systems have been proposed as a solution to solve broadband railway communication problems. Channel estimation and equalisation for OFDM system become challenging when the mobile terminal is moving at high speed as the OFDM subcarriers lose their orthogonality in such situations. In this paper we present a novel channel estimation algorithm based on the hyperbolic modelling of rapidly varying channels. The hyperbolic model is based on the observation of the OFDM frequency domain channel matrix provided by rapid channel simulator, and on mathematical analysis of the off-diagonal elements of the channel matrix. The hyperbolic model can be combined with an FFT interpolation technique and then used to perform an iterative least square estimation of the channel matrix even when sparse pilot distribution is used. Furthermore, a sliding window discrete optimisation procedure is introduced to improve the performance of the suboptimal Linear Minimum Mean Square (LMMSE) channel equalisation technique. Numerical results for a mobile moving at 280 km/h and under the Wide Sense Stationary Uncorrelated Scattering (WSSUS) channel assumption are reported. The provided results prove the efficiency and effectiveness of the suggested algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid changing channel estimation and equalisation based on hyperbolic modelling for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2013.6685573","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678913/6685509/06685573.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2013.6685573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Rapid changing channel estimation and equalisation based on hyperbolic modelling for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685573/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977478","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid changing channel estimation and equalisation based on hyperbolic modelling for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tampere, Finland","sourcePdf":"1569831289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086027S","chronDate":"5-7 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678913","isNumber":"6685509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678913","xplore-issue":"6685509","articleId":"6685573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685594,"authors":[{"name":"U.

In the first proposed algorithm, we make use of the three-dimensional DBA algorithm from wireless OFDM, modify it according to the characteristics of the fiber channel, and apply it to upstream access in OFDMA-PONs to reduce the transmitting power of ONUs. In order tofurther minimize the total transmitting power, we propose the second algorithm by allocating the subcarrier and bit in the same procedure. The complexity of the two proposed algorithms was evaluated by polynomial time. From simulation results, the transmitting power of ONUs under a certain bit error rate is reduced by ~30% and ~50% using the first and the second proposed algorithms, respectively, compared with the traditional two-dimensional DBA algorithm in OFDMA-PONs.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.5.001353","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/6685595/06685600.pdf","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.5.001353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm in OFDMA-PONs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685600/","displayDocTitle":"Power efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm in OFDMA-PONs","volume":"5","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13973349","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685600/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power efficient dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm in OFDMA-PONs","sourcePdf":"1353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157999S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6685595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6685595","articleId":"6685600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6685605,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["CSPC Group, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533619600"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["CSPC Group, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"6685605","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical distortion","OFDM","Optical modulation","Optical polarization","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","intensity modulation","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","optical distortion","optical modulation","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer modulation","MLM-aided IMDD DCO-OFDM","intensity-modulated direct-detection optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM","ACO-OFDM","double turbo receiver","clipping distortion","genetic-algorithm-aided weight optimization","bits per symbol throughput","BPS throughput","numerical analysis","DTR iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Optical modulation","Optical OFDM","Peak-to-average-power-ratio reduction","Turbo receiver"]}],"abstract":"Multi-layer modulation (MLM)-aided intensity-modulated direct-detection (IM/DD) DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) are considered.

Circuits are only used to provide static point-to-point optical links between routers. As others have recognized, current practice makes it hard to take advantage of very high-speed, low-power optical circuit switches in the core. Despite many proposals to mix packet switching with dynamic circuit switching, none have taken hold. In these times of rapidly increasing traffic, and rapidly decreasing profits for ISPs, it is time to rethink how backbones are built. In this paper, we propose to replace the largest backbone routers with much cheaper hybrid packet-optical switches in a fully meshed IP core. We take advantage of new control planes for software-defined networks to control the packet and circuit networks from a single vantage point. To demonstrate the enormous potential cost savings, we present a detailed analysis of the capital expenditure and show how our approach offers 60% cost savings for typical backbone operators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6685608/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13973350","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rethinking IP core networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rethinking IP core networks","sourcePdf":"1431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060368S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6685595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6685595","articleId":"6685608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6685663,"authors":[{"name":"Jianmin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37076229900"},{"name":"Lasith Yasakethu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Lasith","lastName":"Yasakethu","id":"37086666656"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5106-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685663","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","SCADA systems","Support vector machines","Training","Computer security","Feature extraction","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critical infrastructures","risk analysis","SCADA systems","security of data","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one class SVM","SCADA systems protection","European Framework-7","CockpicCI project","intelligent risk detection techniques","intelligent risk analysis techniques","intelligent risk protection techniques","critical infrastructures","automated anomaly detection","supervisory control and data acquisition","SCADA field equipment communications","central SCADA systems","support vector machines","telecommunication networks","detection rates","CI","FP7"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","risk analysis","SVMs"]}],"abstract":"Funded by European Framework-7 (FP7), the CockpicCI project aims at developing intelligent risk detection, analysis and protection techniques for Critical Infrastructures (CI).

Network simulators lack a realistic near space path loss and fading module which would allow having accurate simulation. To explore and simulate accurately the influence of rain, cloud, gaseous absorption and multipath fading on the air-ground link, the mathematical and simulation models for the rain attenuation, cloud attenuation, gaseous absorption attenuation and Ricean fading were implemented. Moreover, modeling and simulation were done within QualNet. Simulation results quantitatively show the effects of rain attenuation, cloud attenuation, gaseous absorption attenuation and Ricean fading on the performance of packet delivery rate of the High Altitude Platform station (HAPs) air-ground link. Thus, simulation of the air-ground link becomes more accurate and reasonable. Simultaneously, the used simulation platform is also improved by integrating new models.","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2013.78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2013.78","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/6684446/6685639/06685719.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Simulation of Pathloss and Fading for Air-Ground Link of HAPs within a Network Simulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Simulation of Pathloss and Fading for Air-Ground Link of HAPs within a Network Simulator","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991144","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685719/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Simulation of Pathloss and Fading for Air-Ground Link of HAPs within a Network Simulator","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5106a421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063446S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6684446","isNumber":"6685639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6684446","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6685639","articleId":"6685719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685720,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzhen Huang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37597449200"},{"name":"Yunpeng Cheng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yunpeng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37279570000"},{"name":"Xueqiang Zheng","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xueqiang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37652448700"},{"name":"Jinlong Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinlong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086321718"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5106-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685720","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of MRC Diversity for Spectrum Sharing Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation","abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance of maximum ratio combining (MRC) diversity in spectrum sharing systems with imperfect channel estimation. Considering the limited power and number of pilot symbols, we study the impact of imperfect channel estimation about the secondary transmission link on the performance of the spectrum sharing system. Specifically, the exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average symbol error rate (SER) of spectrum sharing systems are derived, and the impact of various key system parameters, such as interference temperature, number of antennas, and channel estimation error, is investigated. Moreover, simple asymptotic expressions for the outage probability and average SER at the high signal-to-noise-ratio regime are provided, based on which the diversity and coding gains achieved by the secondary system are characterized. The finding of this paper suggests that zero diversity gain is attained due to imperfect channel estimation whereas a full diversity can be achieved under the perfect channel estimation case.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6684446/6685639/06685720.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"432","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2013.79","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2013.79","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685720","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity reception","Diversity methods","Receivers","Vectors","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","diversity reception","probability","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","MRC diversity","spectrum sharing systems","imperfect channel estimation","maximum ratio combining diversity","secondary transmission link","exact closed-form expressions","outage probability","average symbol error rate","SER","simple asymptotic expressions","high signal-to-noise-ratio regime"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum sharing","imperfect channel estimation","outage probability","SER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685720/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of MRC Diversity for Spectrum Sharing Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation","accessionNumber":"13991083","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6685720/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of MRC Diversity for Spectrum Sharing Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5106a427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054107S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6684446","isNumber":"6685639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6684446","xplore-issue":"6685639","articleId":"6685720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685722,"authors":[{"name":"Xuefei Wang","affiliation":["Dept.

It is very important to establish a reasonable channel model to simulate the actual scene. In this paper, a novel cooperative channel model framework is proposed for cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels. The proposed model framework is adaptable to multiple cooperative MIMO scenarios when the relay's mode is Amplify-and-forward. Given the information of correlation coefficient of transmitting, relay and receiving and the information of Mean and variance of Rayleigh channel, we can simulate the equivalent channel. Matlab simulations show that the equivalent channel is reasonable and the presented channel model can imitate the characters of the AF channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel7/6684446/6685639/06685724.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"452","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2013.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2013.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Cooperative MIMO Channel Model Concerning the Correlation of B-R and R-M","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","Relays","Channel models","Wireless communication","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","cooperative communication","correlation methods","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","stochastic processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic cooperative MIMO channel model","B-R correlation","R-M correlation","AF relay system","channel estimations","novel cooperative channel model framework","cooperative multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels","relay mode","amplify-and-forward","Rayleigh channel variance","equivalent channel simulation","Matlab simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative communication","correlation","channel model","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Cooperative MIMO Channel Model Concerning the Correlation of B-R and R-M","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685724/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991146","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Cooperative MIMO Channel Model Concerning the Correlation of B-R and R-M","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5106a448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078353S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6684446","isNumber":"6685639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6684446","xplore-issue":"6685639","articleId":"6685724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685736,"authors":[{"name":"Shaobo Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer and communication engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaobo","lastName":"Shi","id":"37086660683"},{"name":"Yue Qi","affiliation":["School of Computer and communication engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085408992"},{"name":"Qin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and communication engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085407933"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5106-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6685736","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Itemsets","Data mining","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Acceleration","Indexes","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA acceleration","Eclat","frequent itemset mining algorithm","sorted-set intersection computation","parallel data mining","comparator matrix structure","parallel intersection computation","software implementation","full comparator matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel Data mining","FPGA acceleration","Frequent itemset mining","sorted-set intersection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685736","abstract":"Frequent item set mining is an important researching area in data mining and Eclat is a typical and high performance frequent item set mining algorithm.

However, to this date it is still unclear whether the envisioned V2V standard, dedicated short-range communications, can become available in commercially available vehicle products, while widely available consumergrade GPS receivers do not provide the required accuracy for many safety applications. In this article, combining visible light communications and visible light positioning, we propose the use of smart automotive lighting in vehicle safety systems. These lights would be able to provide the functions of illumination and signaling, reliable communications, and accurate positioning in a single solution. The proposed solution has low complexity, and is shown to be scalable in high vehicle density and fast topology changing scenarios. In this article, we also present several design guidelines for such a system, based on the results of our analytic and empirical studies. Finally, evaluation of our prototype provides evidence that the system can indeed detect potential risks in advance and provide early warnings to the driver in real-world scenarios, lowering the probability of traffic accidents.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6685741/06685757.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6685757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6685757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart automotive lighting for vehicle safety","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Receivers","Lighting","Radio frequency","Vehicle safety","Intelligent vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","Global Positioning System","lighting","mobile radio","radio receivers","road safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic accidents probability","real-world scenarios","design guidelines","vehicle density","reliable communications","signaling","illumination","vehicle safety systems","visible light positioning","visible light communications","safety applications","consumer-grade GPS receivers","short-range communications","V2V standard","submeter error","V2V communications","communications","smart automotive lighting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Smart automotive lighting for vehicle safety","volume":"51","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6685757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13973297","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart automotive lighting for vehicle safety","sourcePdf":"016TSAI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068474S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6685741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6685741","articleId":"6685757","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6685758,"authors":[{"name":"Liane Grobe","affiliation":["Heinrich Hertz Institute"],"bio":{"p":["Liane Grobe (liane.grobe@hhi.fraunhofer.de) received her Dipl.-Ing. degree on media technology from Technische Universitaet Ilmenau, Germany, in 2008.

Signals transmitted by the LEDs are used to determine the position of a person or object within a room. To take full advantage of this new opportunity, it is essential that comprehensive and robust international standards are developed before a plethora of incompatible proprietary systems flood the market. In this article, we discuss the very diverse range of potential applications of these future systems and their implications for the design of a new standard. Another consideration is that the transmission of positioning signals must not compromise the primary function of the LEDs, which is energy-efficient illumination, so visible flicker must be avoided. Position information can be derived from a range of properties of the received signal, such as the power of the received signal or the angle at which the signal reaches the receiver. The suitability of different techniques for an indoor positioning system is considered. Finally, we discuss the implications each of these aspects has for the design of an effective standard.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6685759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6685759","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6685741/06685759.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible light positioning: a roadmap for international standardization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Visible light positioning: a roadmap for international standardization","volume":"51","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13973291","publicationDate":"December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6685759/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible light positioning: a roadmap for international standardization","sourcePdf":"018ARMSTRONG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044415S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6685741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"255","xplore-issue":"6685741","articleId":"6685759","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6685761,"authors":[{"name":"Chester Sungchung Park","affiliation":["Konkuk University"],"bio":{"p":["Chester Sunghcung Park (sungchung.park@gmail.com) received his Ph.D. degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, in 2006.

Geolocation databases are designed to store information related to incumbents, and CRs are envisioned to consult this database before spectrum access. Spectrum occupancy and related environment information can be constructed using these geolocation databases. In that regard, Radio Environment Map (REM) is a promising tool that provides a practical means for the realization of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). It constructs a comprehensive map of the CRN by utilizing multi-domain information from geolocation databases, characteristics of spectrum use, geographical terrain models, propagation environment, and regulations. REMs contribute to cognition engines by building long-term knowledge via processing spectrum measurements collected from sensors to estimate the state of locations where there is no measurement data. In addition, REM utilizes feedback from the CRs and can apply various learning tools. The vision is to design CRNs such that CRs, though being simple devices without advanced cognitive functionalities, can become cognitive via REMs and operate in an efficient manner. In this paper, an overview of the REM concept is presented in various dimensions ranging from its architecture and stored information to REM construction techniques as well as REM quality metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","publicationDate":"December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685772/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13973296","volume":"51","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radio environment map as enabler for practical cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio environment map as enabler for practical cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"031YILMAZ_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05424S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6685741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6685741","articleId":"6685772","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6685773,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Xia","affiliation":["INRS, University of Quebec"],"bio":{"p":["Minghua Xia [M] (xia@emt.inrs.ca) is a Research Fellow at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Energy, Materials and Telecommunications center (INRS-EMT), University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada.

Among its three major implementation paradigms, namely, interweave, overlay and underlay, underlay CR is the most flexible. However, the transmit power of secondary users (SUs) having to be strictly limited by the prescribed tolerable interference power dictated by primary users (PUs), confines underlay CR to short-range communications. To address this limitation, cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying techniques can be exploited to extend the coverage area and reduce the interference region of secondary transmission with low implementation complexity. Nevertheless, despite the significant potential of cooperation in underlay CR systems, advances in this context have been limited so far, mainly due to the extreme difficulty of mathematical tractability involved in the performance evaluation and design of these systems. This article aims to overview recent advances in this area. In particular, important dominating factors on system performance of underlay cooperative AF relaying in cellular networks are identified, in terms of cochannel interference coming from concurrent primary transmission, relay selection, number of relaying hops, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we outline some future research topics in this exciting area.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2013.6685773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/6685741/06685773.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2013.6685773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underlay cooperative af relaying in cellular networks: performance and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685773/","displayDocTitle":"Underlay cooperative af relaying in cellular networks: performance and challenges","volume":"51","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13973289","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685773/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underlay cooperative af relaying in cellular networks: performance and challenges","sourcePdf":"032XIA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071111S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6685741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6685741","articleId":"6685773","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685797,"authors":[{"name":"Amanda S.

In general terms, existing solutions for MD-PLE support high-level model refinement into lower level abstractions in order to reach code implementation of product line architectures. Nevertheless, the applicability of such approaches is limited due to either the unsystematic processes that do not clearly specify how to refine models to decrease the level of abstraction, or the lack of automation support. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure for MD-PLE. The infrastructure encompasses a model-driven, systematic and semi-automated engineering method that combines a set of existing process, tools, languages and models to implement product line architectures. Common Variability Language (CVL) is adopted to specify and resolve architectural variability explicitly and systematically.

With the utilization of the presented method, the SNR of the target range profiles is improved, the conventional ISAR motion compensation methods perform much better, and the ISAR image result is much better focused under a low SNR condition.

For a variety of reasons it is often desirable to automatically detect and remove these artifacts. Especially, for accurate source localization of epileptic spikes in an EEG recording from a patient with epilepsy, it is of great importance to remove any concurrent artifact. Due to similarities in morphology between the EKG artifacts and epileptic spikes, any automated artifact removal algorithm must have an extremely low false-positive rate in addition to a high detection rate. In this paper, an automated algorithm for removal of EKG artifact is proposed that satisfies such criteria. The proposed method, which uses combines independent component analysis and continuous wavelet transformation, uses both temporal and spatial characteristics of EKG related potentials to identify and remove the artifacts. The method outperforms algorithms that use general statistical features such as entropy and kurtosis for artifact rejection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6815992/06685831.pdf","startPage":"1634","endPage":"1641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2295173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2295173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6815992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Removal of EKG Artifact From EEG Data Using Independent Component Analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Electroencephalography","Integrated circuits","Continuous wavelet transforms","Scalp","Algorithm design and analysis","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","independent component analysis","medical signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EKG artifact automated removal","EEG data","independent component analysis","continuous wavelet transformation","electrical potential","cardiac activity","electroencephalogram","electrocardiographic artifact","epileptic spikes","entropy","kurtosis","artifact rejection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous wavelet transformation (CWT)","electrocardiographic (EKG) artifact","electroencephalogram (EEG)","independent component analysis (ICA)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Algorithms","Artifacts","Electrocardiography","Electroencephalography","Humans","Wavelet Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Automated Removal of EKG Artifact From EEG Data Using Independent Component Analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation","volume":"61","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6685831/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14300714","pubMedId":"24845273","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Removal of EKG Artifact From EEG Data Using Independent Component Analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation","sourcePdf":"tbme-bagherihamaneh-2295173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100174S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6815992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6815992","articleId":"6685831","onlineDate":"17 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6685834,"authors":[{"name":"Benoit Frenay","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6786374/6685834/frena-2292894-small.gif","p":["Beno\u00eet Fr\u00e9nay received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain, Belgium, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","His current research interests include machine learning include support vector machines, label noise, extreme learning, graphical models, classification, data clustering, probability density estimation, and feature selection."]},"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Frenay","id":"37085394487"},{"name":"Michel Verleysen","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics and Applied Mathematics, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6786374/6685834/verle-2292894-small.gif","p":["Michel Verleysen (M'86) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain, Belgium, in 1987 and 1992, respectively.","He is a Full Professor with Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, and the Honorary Research Director of the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research.

For example, the accuracy of predictions may decrease, whereas the complexity of inferred models and the number of necessary training samples may increase. Many works in the literature have been devoted to the study of label noise and the development of techniques to deal with label noise. However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey on the different types of label noise, their consequences and the algorithms that consider label noise. This paper proposes to fill this gap. First, the definitions and sources of label noise are considered and a taxonomy of the types of label noise is proposed. Second, the potential consequences of label noise are discussed. Third, label noise-robust, label noise cleansing, and label noise-tolerant algorithms are reviewed. For each category of approaches, a short discussion is proposed to help the practitioner to choose the most suitable technique in its own particular field of application. Eventually, the design of experiments is also discussed, what may interest the researchers who would like to test their own algorithms. In this paper, label noise consists of mislabeled instances: no additional information is assumed to be available like e.g., confidences on labels.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6786374/06685834.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6786374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification in the Presence of Label Noise: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Classification in the Presence of Label Noise: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685834/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14236946","pubMedId":"24808033","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685834/","volume":"25","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification in the Presence of Label Noise: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tnnls-frenay-2292894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.409668S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6786374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"557","xplore-issue":"6786374","articleId":"6685834","onlineDate":"17 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6685836,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085396605"},{"name":"Zhengwei Du","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengwei","lastName":"Du","id":"37275786100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6685836","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3082},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685836","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual coupling","Couplings","Bandwidth","Impedance","Scattering parameters","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","microstrip antenna arrays","printed circuits","S-parameters","telecommunication terminals","UHF antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband printed dual-antenna","neutralization line","mobile terminal","symmetric antenna element","printed circuit board","mutual coupling","S-parameters","surface current distributions","simplified equivalent model","impedance bandwidth","GSM1800","GSM1900","UMTS","LTE2300","LTE2500","WLAN band","radiation patterns","diversity performance","bandwidth 1.3 GHz","frequency 1.62 GHz to 2.92 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband decoupling","multi-antenna","multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)","neutralization line"]}],"abstract":"A wideband printed dual-antenna for mobile terminals is studied.

The major source of EMI, in bioelectric measurement systems, is mains power, which is mainly coupled to the system through stray capacitances. The interference reduction is usually implemented using driven-right-leg (DRL) and shield-driver circuits, which are both feedback circuits. A variety of other auxiliary circuits may also be used for safety, ESD protection, and radio-frequency EMI filtering. Therefore, the system has great potential to become unstable. The general equivalent circuit of the bioelectric measurement system, which models the parasitic capacitive couplings between mains power and the system, is well known. The stability analysis of such systems is performed based on the simplified model, which is extracted from the general model by neglecting many electrical elements. In this paper, a simple and powerful approach is proposed to define the loop gain of the bioelectric measurement system explicitly and directly from the general model. Due to the nature of the proposed method, it can be implemented directly using computer-aided design software, to calculate the loop gain of the general model. Thus, the design process is improved significantly and many complex situations can be analyzed more easily. In particular, the proposed approach shows its advantages when the power line interference is coupled to the system through various capacitive paths. Another contribution of this paper is the stability analysis of isolated amplifier system, which is equipped with transconductance DRL and shield-driver circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14351593","htmlLink":"/document/6685837/","displayDocTitle":"The Stability Analysis of a Biopotential Measurement System Equipped With Driven-Right-Leg and Shield-Driver Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Stability Analysis of a Biopotential Measurement System Equipped With Driven-Right-Leg and Shield-Driver Circuits","sourcePdf":"tim-alnasser-2293811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07211S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6826597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6826597","articleId":"6685837","onlineDate":"17 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6685852,"authors":[{"name":"Aiguo Song","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Aiguo Song (M'98\u2013SM'11) received the B.S. degree in automatic control, the M.S. degree in measurement and control from Nanjing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Nanjing, China, in 1990 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in measurement and control from Southeast University, Nanjing, in 1996.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Instrument Science and Engineering, Southeast University.

This paper presents a novel design of a surface texture sensor by imitating human active texture perception by touch. A thin polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is used as the sensitive element to fabricate a high-accuracy, high-speed-response fabric surface texture sensor, and a mechanism is designed to produce the relative motion at a certain speed between the texture sensor and the surface of the perceived fabric with constant contact force. Thus, the surface texture property can be measured as the output charge of the PVDF film of the sensor induced by the small height/depth variation of the moving fabric surface. A texture feature extraction method by compressing the zero value spectral lines in frequency domain is proposed. In addition, a radial basis function (RBF) neural networks based on unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm is used as classifier for texture recognition. The experiments show that the proposed texture sensor is effective in detecting the feature signals of fabric surface textures, which are suitable for the RBF networks to classify the different fabrics.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrics","Surface texture","Force","Surface treatment","Neural networks","Force sensors","Strain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fabrics","feature extraction","radial basis function networks","statistical analysis","surface texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture sensor","fabric surface textures","fabric texture measurement","fabric texture classification","polyvinylidene fluoride","PVDF film","texture feature extraction method","radial basis function neural networks","RBF networks","unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm","texture recognition","feature signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fabric texture classification","fabric texture measurement","radial basis function (RBF) neural networks","textile industry","texture sensor."]},{"kwd":["Fabric texture classification","fabric texture measurement","radial basis function (RBF) neural networks","textile industry","texture sensor"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6826597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2013.2293812","startPage":"1739","endPage":"1747","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6826597/06685852.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2013.2293812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Texture Sensor for Fabric Texture Measurement and Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Texture Sensor for Fabric Texture Measurement and Classification","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14351582","publicationDate":"July 2014","volume":"63","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685852/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272379, 61240032 and 61325018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2010063"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Texture Sensor for Fabric Texture Measurement and Classification","sourcePdf":"tim-song-2293812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065979S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6826597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6826597","articleId":"6685852","onlineDate":"17 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6685855,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Computer and Energy Engineering, School of Electrical, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6685848/6685855/6685855-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Cao (S'99\u2013M'02\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. degree in physics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1996, the M.A. degree in biophysics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","He was a Summer Intern with Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA, in 2000, and with IBM Microelectronics Division, East Fishkill, NY, USA, in 2001.

The situation is further compounded by real-time uncertainties in workload and ambient conditions, which dynamically influence the degradation rate. To improve design predictability and guarantee system lifetime, accurate modeling, and simulation tools for reliability are essential to both digital and analog circuits. This paper presents cross-layer solutions for emerging reliability threats, including: 1) device-level modeling of reliability mechanisms, such as transistor aging and its statistical behavior; 2) circuit-level long-term aging models that capture unique operation patterns in digital and analog design, and directly predict the degradation; and 3) simulation methods for very-large-scale designs. Built on the long-term model, the new methods significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of reliability analysis. As validated by silicon data, these solutions close the gap between the underlying reliability physics and circuit/system design for resilience.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

of power. Indeed, they can hardly provide a full day of use between charging operations even with a 2000 mAh battery. While power minimization and dynamic power management techniques have been heavily explored to improve the power efficiency of modules (processors, memory, display, GPS, etc.) inside a smartphone platform, there is one critical factor that is often overlooked: the power conversion efficiency of the power delivery network (PDN). This paper focuses on dc-dc converters, which play a pivotal role in the PDN of the smartphone platform. Starting from detailed models of the dc-dc converter designs, two optimization methods are presented: 1) static switch sizing to maximize the efficiency of a dc-dc converter under statistical loading profiles and 2) dynamic switch modulation to achieve the high efficiency enhancement under dynamically varying load conditions. To verify the efficacy of the optimization methods in actual smartphone platforms, this paper also presents a characterization procedure for the PDN. The procedure is as follows: 1) group the modules in the smartphone platform together and use profiling to estimate their average and peak power consumption levels and 2) build an equivalent dc-dc converter model for the power delivery path from the battery source to each group of modules and use linear regression to estimate the conversion efficiency of the corresponding equivalent converter. Experimental results demonstrate that the static switch sizing can achieve 6% power conversion efficiency enhancement, which translates to 19% reduction in power loss general usage of the smartphone. The dynamic switch modulation accomplishes similar improvement at the same condition, while also achieving high efficiency enhancement in various load conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the Power Delivery Network in a Smartphone Platform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2282287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6685848/06685857.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2282287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the Power Delivery Network in a Smartphone Platform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973341","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the Power Delivery Network in a Smartphone Platform","sourcePdf":"tcad-lee-2282287-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040315S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"6685848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6685857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6685884,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Feng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of the Ministry of Education of China, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6750067/6685884/6685884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Feng received the B.S. degree from Chang'an University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.

It involves two crucial problems, i.e., suitable measure criterion and effective search strategy. Mutual information (MI) has been widely used as the measure criterion for its nonlinear and nonparametric characteristics. For efficient calculation, traditional MI-based criteria commonly use bivariate MI (BMI) to approximate the ideal MI-based criterion. However, these BMI-based criteria may miss the bands having discriminative information and do not give the condition of the approximation. In this paper, a novel criterion based on trivariate MI (TMI) is proposed to measure the redundancy for classification. From the multivariate MI perspective, the proposed TMI-based and traditional BMI-based criteria are proved as the low-order approximations of the ideal criterion under some assumptions. Compared with the BMI-based criteria, a more relaxed assumption condition is required for the TMI-based criterion. To alleviate the problem of few labeled samples existing in hyperspectral images, the TMI-based criterion is extended to the semisupervised TMI-based (STMI) method by adding a graph regulation term. Additionally, to search an appropriate band subset by the TMI- and STMI-based criteria, a new clonal selection algorithm (CSA) is proposed. In CSA, integer encoding and adaptive operators are devised to reduce space and time cost. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for hyperspectral band selection.","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6750067/06685884.pdf","startPage":"4092","endPage":"4105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2279591","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2279591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685884","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Approximation methods","Redundancy","Feature extraction","Correlation","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","hyperspectral imaging","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral band selection","trivariate mutual information","clonal selection algorithm","preprocessing step","hyperspectral data processing","suitable measure criterion","effective search strategy","nonlinear characteristic","nonparametric characteristic","efficient calculation","traditional MI-based criteria","bivariate MI","BMI","ideal MI-based criterion","discriminative information","approximation condition","trivariate MI","TMI","classification redundancy measurement","multivariate MI perspective","proposed TMI-based criteria","traditional BMI-based criteria","low-order approximations","ideal criterion","relaxed assumption condition","labeled samples","hyperspectral images","semisupervised TMI-based method","STMI method","graph regulation term","appropriate band subset","STMI-based criteria","CSA","integer encoding","adaptive operators","space reduction","time cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clonal selection algorithm (CSA)","graph regulation","hyperspectral band selection","trivariate mutual information (TMI)"]},{"kwd":["Clonal selection algorithm (CSA)","graph regulation","hyperspectral band selection","trivariate mutual information (TMI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Band Selection Based on Trivariate Mutual Information and Clonal Selection","accessionNumber":"14131250","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6685884/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"},{"fundingName":"Program for Cheung Kong Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1170"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs (the 111 Project)","grantNumber":"B07048"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272282"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"K50513100012 and K50511020011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Band Selection Based on Trivariate Mutual Information and Clonal Selection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-feng-2279591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112112S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6750067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6750067","articleId":"6685884","onlineDate":"17 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6685904,"authors":[{"name":"William Lumpkins","affiliation":["Wi2Wi"],"bio":{"p":["William Lumpkins, (xillia@ieee.org) is the lead technical consultant for Wi2Wi, Inc.

A controlled voltage drop in the wind farm collector grid is initiated upon the occurrence of fault in the high-voltage grid in order to achieve fast power reduction. In the process, a dc voltage of defined magnitude and duration is injected by the sending-end converter together with the voltage reduction to suppress the dc component of the short-circuit current arising from the voltage reduction. As a result, the electrical and mechanical stress on the wind turbines, especially on the DFIG-based units and their converters, are mitigated.

The system can synchronize two camera inputs with the same view with only a tiny time delay on the sub-microsecond timescale. Real-time video processing is performed in hardware logic by extracting the moment features of multiple cells in 512 \u00d7 256 images at 4000 fps for the two camera inputs and their frame-straddling time can be adjusted from 0 to 0.25 ms in 9.9 ns steps. By setting the frame-straddling time in a certain range to avoid large image displacements between the two camera inputs, our frame-straddling high-speed vision platform can perform simultaneous shape and motion analysis of cells in fast microchannel flows of 1 m/s or greater. The results of real-time experiments conducted to analyze the deformabilities and velocities of sea urchin egg cells fast-flowing in microchannels verify the efficacy of our vision-based cell analysis system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microchannel","Cameras","Shape","Real-time systems","Feature extraction","Head","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","bioMEMS","cellular biophysics","delays","feature extraction","image motion analysis","image sensors","microchannel flow","synchronisation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous vision-based shape","motion analysis","cell fast-flowing","microchannel flows","multiobject feature extraction algorithm","frame-straddling high-speed vision platform","synchronization","camera inputs","tiny time delay","submicrosecond timescale","real-time video processing","hardware logic","moment feature extraction","frame-straddling time","camera inputs","deformabilities","sea urchin egg cells","vision-based cell analysis system","time 0 ns to 9.9 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automated cell inspection","cell deformation analysis","frame-straddling camera","high-speed vision","lab-on-a-chip (LOC)","multiobject feature extraction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASE.2013.2292583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7000614/06685940.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7000614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2013.2292583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Vision-Based Shape and Motion Analysis of Cells Fast-Flowing in a Microchannel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Vision-Based Shape and Motion Analysis of Cells Fast-Flowing in a Microchannel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685940/","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685940/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14835989","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Vision-Based Shape and Motion Analysis of Cells Fast-Flowing in a Microchannel","sourcePdf":"tase-gu-2292583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103862S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7000614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7000614","articleId":"6685940","onlineDate":"17 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6685966,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Paralleling and Distributed Processing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7031983/6685966/6685966-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng Ma received the BS and PhD degrees in computer science and technology from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

Existing designs for torus networks do not efficiently handle variable-size packets. For deadlock free operations, a design uses two VCs, which negatively affects the router frequency. Some optimizations use one VC. Yet, they regard all packets as maximum-length packets, inefficiently utilizing the precious buffers. We propose flit bubble flow control (FBFC), which maintains one free flit-size buffer slot to avoid deadlock. FBFC uses one VC, and does not treat short packets as long ones.

Many approaches have been proposed to lower the error floor by designing new LDPC codes with fewer such substructures or by modifying the decoding algorithm. Using a theoretical analysis of iterative MP decoding in an idealized trapping set scenario, we show that a contributor to the error floors observed in the literature may be the imprecise implementation of decoding algorithms and, in particular, the message quantization rules used. We then propose a new quantization method - (q+1)-bit quasi-uniform quantization - that efficiently increases the dynamic range of messages, thereby overcoming a limitation of conventional quantization schemes. Finally, we use the quasi-uniform quantizer to decode several LDPC codes that suffer from high error floors with traditional fixed-point decoder implementations. The performance simulation results provide evidence that the proposed quantization scheme can, for a wide variety of codes, significantly lower error floors with minimal increase in decoder complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.112313.120917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6719911/06685976.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.112313.120917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized Iterative Message Passing Decoders with Low Error Floor for LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","displayDocTitle":"Quantized Iterative Message Passing Decoders with Low Error Floor for LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685976/","publicationDate":"January 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14056418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685976/","volume":"62","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized Iterative Message Passing Decoders with Low Error Floor for LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"001-tc1401-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11462S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6719911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6719911","articleId":"6685976","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6685977,"authors":[{"name":"Colby Boyer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6777265/6685977/6685977-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Colby Boyer Colby Boyer received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California Berkeley in 2009.

RFID is distinguished by inexpensive, low power and compact form factor tags, whose longevity and efficacy are predicated on using passive communication techniques and on-tag power harvesting. Such tags employ backscatter modulation, which does not require any active RF components. As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model. In turn,the trade off between diversity order and spatial multiplexing gains are distinct from wide-area MIMO.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.120713.130417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.120713.130417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06685977.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u2014 Invited Paper \u2014 Backscatter Communication and RFID: Coding, Energy, and MIMO Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"\u2014 Invited Paper \u2014 Backscatter Communication and RFID: Coding, Energy, and MIMO Analysis","volume":"62","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685977/","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685977/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u2014 Invited Paper \u2014 Backscatter Communication and RFID: Coding, Energy, and MIMO Analysis","sourcePdf":"0770-tc1403-boyer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131959S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6685977","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6685978,"authors":[{"name":"Shijian Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6719911/6685978/6685978-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shijian Tang (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Tianjin University in 2011, and now is pursuing his M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University.

The impulse response of UWOC links has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally by researchers but has not been derived in simple closed-form to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we analyze the optical characteristics of seawater and present a closed-form expression of double Gamma functions to model the channel impulse response. The double Gamma functions model fits well with Monte Carlo simulation results in turbid seawater such as coastal and harbor water. The bit-error-rate (BER) and channel bandwidth are further evaluated based on this model for various link ranges. Numerical results suggest that the temporal pulse spread strongly degrades the BER performance for high data rate UWOC systems with on-off keying (OOK) modulation and limits the channel bandwidth in turbid underwater environments. The zero-forcing (ZF) equalization designed based on our channel model has been adopted to overcome ISI and improve the system performance. It is plausible and convenient to utilize this impulse response model for performance analysis and system design of UWOC systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.120713.130199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.120713.130199","startPage":"226","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6719911/06685978.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulse Response Modeling for Underwater Wireless Optical Communication Links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Impulse Response Modeling for Underwater Wireless Optical Communication Links","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056427","publicationDate":"January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6685978/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulse Response Modeling for Underwater Wireless Optical Communication Links","sourcePdf":"226-tc1401-tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070267S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6719911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"6719911","articleId":"6685978","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6685979,"authors":[{"name":"Jihai Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6719911/6685979/6685979-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jihai Cao received the B.A.Sc. and M.A.Sc. degrees with honours in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, China in 2006 and 2008 respectively and Ph.D. from McMaster University, Canada in 2013.

Through simulation, binary-input distributions have been observed to be optimal in many cases, however, little analytical work exists on conditions for optimality or the form of optimal signalling. In this second part, the general properties of Part I are extended to the case of DTP channels where binary-inputs are optimal. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the optimality of binary (i.e. two mass point) distributions are presented by leveraging the general properties of DTP capacity-achieving distributions. Closed-form expressions of the capacity-achieving distributions are derived in several important special cases including zero dark current and for high dark current.

In this paper, the symbol error rate (SER) performance of SM is investigated. In SM, a signal domain modulation (i.e. amplitude-phase modulation) and an antenna domain modulation (i.e. space shift keying) are combined together to achieve a certain transmission rate while exploiting the properties of two independent modulation domains. A key question is the fine balance between the constellation sizes in the two domains when a constant rate is targeted. For a fixed rate, there are many ways to assign constellation vectors to the spatial and signal domains. In this paper, we investigate optimal constellation breakdown between space and signal domains. The analysis is based on the union bound of the error probability of SM with two typical APM schemes, i.e. phase-shift keying (PSK) and square quadrature amplitude modulation (S-QAM). It is shown that, at any transmission rate, there exists an optimal APM dimension in which the SER is minimized. Furthermore, a trade-off between the number of transmit antennas and the transmit power is introduced.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.121313.130514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.121313.130514","startPage":"144","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6719911/06685980.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Spatial Modulation: Optimal Constellation Breakdown","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Spatial Modulation: Optimal Constellation Breakdown","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056438","publicationDate":"January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6685980/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Spatial Modulation: Optimal Constellation Breakdown","sourcePdf":"144-tc1401-maleki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138165S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6719911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6719911","articleId":"6685980","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6685981,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Souto","affiliation":["ISCTE-University Institute of Lisbon, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6816514/6685981/6685981-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nuno M.

Since coherent receivers are usually employed with SC-FDE, accurate channel estimates are required so as to avoid substantial performance degradation. Several channel estimation strategies have been proposed for SC-FDE, but a thoroughly evaluation of the degradation caused by channel estimation errors and a comparison against OFDM is still lacking. In this paper we study the impact of imperfect channel knowledge on SC transmission with focus on the linear frequency domain equalizer (FDE) and on the Iterative Block Decision Feedback Equalizer (IB-DFE). We propose a modified IB-DFE which incorporates knowledge of the channel estimation error model and show that its performance becomes more robust against the presence of strong error components in the channel estimates. We also evaluate, analytically and through simulations, the degradation caused by imperfect channel estimation in SC-FDE and compare it against OFDM schemes (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). It is shown that the channel estimation requirements for SC-FDE are higher than for OFDM unless a channel estimation error aware receiver is employed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on SC-FDE Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.121613.130046","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6816514/06685981.pdf","startPage":"1530","endPage":"1540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.121613.130046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816514","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6685981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on SC-FDE Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6685981/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14301843","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Channel Estimation Errors on SC-FDE Systems","sourcePdf":"1530-tc1405-nuno.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078457S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6816514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6816514","articleId":"6685981","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6685982,"authors":[{"name":"Elsa Dupraz","affiliation":["L2S, Univ.

For each model, we propose a practical coding scheme based on non-binary Low Density Parity Check Codes and able to deal with the parameter uncertainty. At the encoder, the choice of the coding rate results from an information theoretical analysis. Then we propose decoding algorithms that jointly estimate the source vector and the parameters.

In this paper, several fundamental properties of capacity-achieving distributions for DTP channels are established. In particular, we demonstrate that all capacity-achieving distributions of the DTP channel have zero as a mass point. In the case of only a peak constraint, it is further shown that the optimal distribution always has a mass point at the maximum amplitude. Finally, under solely an average power constraint, it is shown that a finite number of mass points are insufficient to achieve the capacity. In addition to these analytical results, a numerical algorithm based on deterministic annealing is presented which can efficiently compute both the channel capacity and the associated optimal input distribution under peak and average power constraints. Numerical lower bounds based on the envelope of information rates induced by the maxentropic distributions are also shown to be extremely close to the capacity, especially in the low power regime.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.112513.130142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.112513.130142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6719911/06685986.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-Achieving Distributions for the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel\u2014Part I: General Properties and Numerical Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Capacity-Achieving Distributions for the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel\u2014Part I: General Properties and Numerical Techniques","volume":"62","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6685986/","publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"14056428","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6685986/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity-Achieving Distributions for the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel\u2014Part I: General Properties and Numerical Techniques","sourcePdf":"194-tc1401-cao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096165S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6719911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6719911","articleId":"6685986","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6685989,"authors":[{"name":"Alain U.

Compact closed-form solutions are obtained for the case of zero-forcing (ZF) V-BLAST with two transmit antennas and necessary optimality conditions are found for the general case. The optimal rate allocation is shown to have a major impact (stronger streams are detected last) while the optimal power allocation does not alter the original Foschini ordering (stronger streams are detected first). Sufficient conditions for the optimality of the greedy ordering are established: it is optimal for the ZF V-BLAST under an optimal rate allocation with two transmit antennas at any SNR and with any number of antennas in the low and high SNR regimes. It satisfies the necessary optimality conditions for larger systems at any SNR and is nearly-optimal in many cases. An SNR gain of ordering is introduced and studied, including closed-form expressions as well as lower and upper bounds and the conditions for their achievability. For the minimum mean square error (MMSE) V-BLAST under an optimal rate allocation, any ordering is shown to deliver the same system capacity.

This brings besides others also many new challenges in the fields of security and reliability. Like any other security and correctness sensitive computer system, it is beneficial to fully verify cloud solutions to ensure their correctness. Verification and validation of distributed systems has been widely studied, however, it has not been analyzed whether verification approaches in distributed systems can be directly applied to cloud computing or not. In this study, we present a comparison of verification requirements for distributed computing and cloud computing to establish the need of a specialized verification model/architecture for cloud computing. We differentiate the verification in distributed and cloud systems based on their business models, architecture models, programming models and security models. We argue that service level agreements (SLAs), which span across the cloud, become more critical in the verification process. Based on our study, we present an abstract verification model focusing specifically on cloud computing, paving the way to an implementation of a viable verification model which can practically verify complex cloud systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685965/6685991/06686021.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","doi":"10.1109/CGC.2013.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGC.2013.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verification Requirements for Secure and Reliable Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Security","Business","Computers","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","contracts","formal verification","security of data","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["verification requirements","secure-reliable cloud computing","distributed system validation","distributed system verification","distributed computing","verification architecture","business model","architecture model","programming model","security model","service level agreements","SLA","verification model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","verification requirements","service level agreements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"Verification Requirements for Secure and Reliable Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686021/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991530","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verification Requirements for Secure and Reliable Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"5114a143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080154S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685965","isNumber":"6685991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685965","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6685991","articleId":"6686021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6686023,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Albano","affiliation":["Postal and Communications Police, Ministry of Interior, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Albano","id":"37086657812"},{"name":"Cosimo Anglano","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 del Piemonte Orientale, DiSIT - Computer Science Institute, Italy"],"firstName":"Cosimo","lastName":"Anglano","id":"37267173000"},{"name":"Massimo Canonico","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 del Piemonte Orientale, DiSIT - Computer Science Institute, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Canonico","id":"37266273800"},{"name":"Marco Guazzone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit\u00e0 di Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Guazzone","id":"38095349700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5114-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686023","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time factors","Pragmatics","Quality of service","IP networks","Benchmark testing","Fuzzy control","Virtual machine monitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","fuzzy control","power aware computing","quality of experience","quality of service","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-Q&E","QoS","energy savings","cloud application management","virtual machines","VMs","bursty workload","dynamic workload","quality-of-services","energy consumption","physical infrastructure","fuzzy controller","physical capacity","Xen-based testbed","e-commerce benchmark"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686023","doi":"10.1109/CGC.2013.31","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","abstract":"We address the problem of managing cloud applications, consisting of a set of virtual machines (VMs), characterized by bursty and dynamic workloads, in such a way to provide guarantees on their Quality-of-Services (QoS) and, at the same time, to minimize the energy consumption of the physical infrastructure running them.

The problem is to find an adequate trade-off between these two conflicting goals. An approach is presented to support the Virtual Machine Monitor in performing resource allocation of VMs running on a physical machine of a cloud provider by expressing the two objectives in a utility function and optimizing this function using fuzzy control. To potentially work for an increased number of virtual machines, a multi-agent fuzzy controller is realized where each agent optimizes its own local utility function. The multi-agent fuzzy controller is empirically compared to a centralized fuzzy controller and an adaptive optimal control approach. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the multi-agent fuzzy controller in finding an adequate trade-off between performance and cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Machine Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing via Multi-Agent Fuzzy Control","doi":"10.1109/CGC.2013.35","startPage":"188","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGC.2013.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685991","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685965/6685991/06686027.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Machine Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing via Multi-Agent Fuzzy Control","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686027/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991451","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Machine Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing via Multi-Agent Fuzzy Control","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"5114a188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098985S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685965","isNumber":"6685991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685965","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6685991","articleId":"6686027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6686059,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, US"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085414280"},{"name":"Krishna Madhavan","affiliation":["School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, US"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Madhavan","id":"37403279800"},{"name":"Mihaela Vorvoreanu","affiliation":["Computer Graphics Technology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, US"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"Vorvoreanu","id":"38489915200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5114-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686059","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":631},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Twitter","Data analysis","Servers","Collaboration","User interfaces","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data mining","Internet","social networking (online)","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web-based tool","collaborative social media data analysis","user-generated content","social media sites","Twitter","Facebook","human behaviors","social phenomena","in-depth qualitative analysis","large-scale data analysis techniques","SWAB","social Web analysis buddy","data mining techniques","large-scale social media text content","user interface design","student-posted content"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["social media analytics","textual content analysis","text mining","Human Computer Interaction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CGC.2013.67","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685965/6685991/06686059.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGC.2013.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Web-Based Tool for Collaborative Social Media Data Analysis","abstract":"User-generated content on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook provides opportunity for researchers in various fields to understand human behaviors and social phenomena. On the one hand, these human behaviors and social phenomena are very complex in nature thus require in-depth qualitative analysis. On the other, the magnitude of social media data requires large-scale data analysis techniques. In this paper, we propose a web-based tool named SWAB (Social Web Analysis Buddy) that integrates both qualitative analysis and large-scale data mining techniques. Specifically, this tool supports asynchronous collaboration among researchers conducting inductive content analysis on textural data from users' online posts and conversations. It then aggregates the results and calculates the agreement among researchers, and builds modeling algorithms based on the qualitative results to classify large-scale social media text content. This current paper focuses on the overall workflow and user interface design of this tool. We demonstrate the prototype of this tool by analyzing student-posted content on Twitter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686059/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13991538","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686059/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Web-Based Tool for Collaborative Social Media Data Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Web-Based Tool for Collaborative Social Media Data Analysis","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"5114a383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094394S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2013-Oct. 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685965","isNumber":"6685991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685965","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6685991","articleId":"6686059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6686148,"authors":[{"name":"Mu Li","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, CMU, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Li","id":"37085454146"},{"name":"Gary L.

Given a n * d matrix where n \u2265 d, these algorithms find an approximation with fewer rows, allowing one to solve a poly(d) sized problem instead. In practice, the best performances are often obtained by invoking these routines in an iterative fashion. We show these iterative methods can be adapted to give theoretical guarantees comparable to and better than the current state of the art. Our approaches are based on computing the importances of the rows, known as leverage scores, in an iterative manner. We show that alternating between computing a short matrix estimate and finding more accurate approximate leverage scores leads to a series of geometrically smaller instances. This gives an algorithm whose runtime is input sparsity plus an overhead comparable to the cost of solving a regression problem on the smaller approximation. Our results build upon the close connection between randomized matrix algorithms, iterative methods, and graph sparsification.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Vectors","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis","Probability","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","matrix algebra","regression analysis","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative row sampling method","regression problems","tall matrices","thin matrices","poly(d) sized problem","leverage scores","randomized matrix algorithms","graph sparsification","short matrix estimate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling","Regression","Well-conditioned Basis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FOCS.2013.22","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 54th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 54th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685222/6686124/06686148.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2013.22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Row Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686148","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Row Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686148/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686148/","accessionNumber":"13991215","conferenceDate":"26-29 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Row Sampling","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5135a127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1097S","chronDate":"26-29 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685222","isNumber":"6686124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685222","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6686124","articleId":"6686148","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6686161,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksander Madry","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Aleksander","lastName":"Madry","id":"37992793800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5135-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-5428"}],"articleNumber":"6686161","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric potential","Vectors","Approximation algorithms","Context","Erbium","Linear systems","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","directed graphs","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["central path navigation","electrical flows","directed graphs","unit capacities","sparse-graph case","maximum-cardinality bipartite matching problem","interior-point methods","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["maximum flow problem","minimum s-t cut problem","bipartite matchings","electrical flows","interior-point methods","central path","Laplacian linear systems"]}],"abstract":"We present an \u00d5(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10/7</sup>\n) = \u00d5(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1.43</sup>\n)-time\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n algorithm for the maximum s-t flow and the minimum s-t cut problems in directed graphs with unit capacities.

So there is the need of extraction anomalies. Anomaly extraction means to find flows associated with the anomalous events, in a large set of flows observed during an anomalous time interval. Anomaly extraction is very important for root-cause analysis, network forensics, attack mitigation and anomaly modeling. To identify the suspicious flows, we use meta-data provided by several histogram based detectors and then apply association rule with multidimensional mining concept to find and summarize anomalous flows. By taking rich traffic data from a backbone network, we show that our technique effectively finds the flows associated with the anomalous events. So by applying multidimensional mining rule to extract anomaly, we can reduce the work-hours needed for analyzing alarms and making anomaly systems more effective.","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2013.8","publicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685964/6686316/06686325.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2013.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686316","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Data Mining for Anomaly Extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Data Mining for Anomaly Extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686325/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991422","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6686325/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Data Mining for Anomaly Extraction","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"5033a005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038431S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685964","isNumber":"6686316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685964","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6686316","articleId":"6686325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6686337,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The foundation of the algorithm lies in an ancient Vedic algorithm. The resulting n-bit squaring architecture translated into hardware. With the proposed architecture using retiming technique the optimizations for large binary number is achieved. The essential idea of retiming is to relocate latch boundaries to balance the delay of each stage. In this paper, we used a method for finding a feasible retiming to optimize a CDFG to meet a smallest iteration period. The production data rates and predictable execution time is model by CDFG graph. The proposed squaring algorithm is significant savings in time when compared with a special case of formula based on Dwandwayoga which means duplex. Duplex of a digit is calculated based on Urdhva-tiryagbhyam.

In order to reduce the computational complexity at the transmitting nodes, the transceiver is implemented at the relay station. Adaptive transceiver consists of an adaptive post equalizer known as receive filter and an adaptive pre-equalizer known as transmit filter. The design of adaptive pre-equalizer requires the knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) between nodes and relay station. So a channel tracking adaptive filter should be implemented at the relay. Due to the structure of a two-way relay system, the training signals used to train the receive filter can be used to train the channel tracking filter. Thus the adaptive channel estimator and receive filter work simultaneously. The channel estimate is then used to design the transmit filter. The adaptive filters are implemented using the NLMS algorithm. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by making use of MATLAB simulations.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685964/6686316/06686414.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2013.82","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2013.82","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Third International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Channel estimation","Transceivers","Vectors","Joints","MIMO","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","channel estimation","computational complexity","MIMO communication","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel estimation","transceiver design","two-way relay systems","transceiver design scheme","MIMO two-way relay systems","computational complexity","transmitting nodes","relay station","adaptive transceiver","adaptive post-equalizer","receive filter","adaptive preequalizer","channel state information","CSI","relay station","channel tracking adaptive filter","channel tracking filter","adaptive channel estimator","transmit filter","NLMS algorithm","MATLAB simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive equalizer","transceiver","channel estimation","two-way relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686414/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Adaptive Channel Estimation and Transceiver Design for Two-Way Relay Systems","accessionNumber":"13991354","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6686414/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Adaptive Channel Estimation and Transceiver Design for Two-Way Relay Systems","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"5033a389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081S","chronDate":"29-31 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685964","isNumber":"6686316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685964","xplore-issue":"6686316","articleId":"6686414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6686425,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh Kumar","affiliation":["Space Applications Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085816127"},{"name":"V.K.

However, to perform a robust handover is a challenging task. In this paper, we study the handover problem for mobile wireless networks in the office environment, where the users' mobility is predictable. We propose a new mechanism using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict the Received Signal Strength (RSS) values. Based on the predicted values, each mobile user can perform the handover decision on his own using his preferred decision making algorithm. Extensive simulations were carried out for an office environment to evaluate the performance of the prediction handover scheme. The results showed that our HMM model can predict the RSS values accurately. The knowledge obtained from prediction is considered in the handover decision making algorithm, which can result in a seamless handover. Moreover, with the knowledge about the future RSS, mobile users can avoid multiple handovers in a short time known as \u201cPing-Pong\u201d effect, which in turn reduces the signaling overheads on the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679376/6686431/06686448.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","doi":"10.1109/WD.2013.6686448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2013.6686448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handover prediction for wireless networks in office environments using Hidden Markov Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handover","Hidden Markov models","Mobile communication","Predictive models","Manganese","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","hidden Markov models","mobility management (mobile radio)","office environment","quality of service","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handover prediction problem","mobile wireless networks","office environments","hidden Markov model","user mobility","QoS degradation","received signal strength value prediction","RSS","HMM model","handover decision making algorithm","ping-pong effect","signaling overhead reduction","quality-of-service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Model","Handover Prediction","Mobile Wireless Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Handover prediction for wireless networks in office environments using Hidden Markov Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686448/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14000970","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handover prediction for wireless networks in office environments using Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569805005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050286S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679376","isNumber":"6686431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679376","xplore-issue":"6686431","articleId":"6686448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6686453,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Al-Nahhal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Al-Nahhal","id":"37085790651"},{"name":"Masoud Alghoniemy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Alghoniemy","id":"37282014500"},{"name":"Adel B.

The economic viability of supporting the secondary operator service using an opportunistic access to the spectrum owned by the primary operator is assessed. Against the benchmark of the primary operator operating as a monopolist, we show that the entry of the secondary operator is desirable from an efficiency perspective, since the carried traffic increases. Additionally, for a range of parameter values, a lump sum payment can be designed so that the incumbent operator has an incentive to let the secondary operator enter. Additionally, the opportunistic access setting has been compared against a leasing-based alternative, and we have concluded that the former outperforms the latter in terms of efficiency and incentive.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14001006","htmlLink":"/document/6686476/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Entry game under opportunistic access in cognitive radio networks: A priority queue model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entry game under opportunistic access in cognitive radio networks: A priority queue model","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569813675.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064441S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679376","isNumber":"6686431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679376","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6686431","articleId":"6686476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6686483,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Bouras","affiliation":["Computer Technology Institute and Press \u201cDiophantus\u201d, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Bouras","id":"37273224300"},{"name":"Georgios Diles","affiliation":["Computer Technology Institute and Press \u201cDiophantus\u201d, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Diles","id":"37085439336"},{"name":"Vasileios Kokkinos","affiliation":["Computer Technology Institute and Press \u201cDiophantus\u201d, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Kokkinos","id":"37304164900"},{"name":"Andreas Papazois","affiliation":["Computer Technology Institute and Press \u201cDiophantus\u201d, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Papazois","id":"37601306800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0543-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"6686483","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Power control","Bandwidth","Macrocell networks","OFDM","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocells interference mitigation","ICIC","inter-cell interference cancellation macrocell environments","coordinated LTE-a networks","data rates","mobile networks","power control","radio management","long term evolution advanced macrocells networks","interference mitigation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["simulation","interference","femtocells","ICIC","LTE"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells offer an attractive solution to locally improve the data rates and coverage of mobile networks, however interference issues may rise when they are deployed to nearby non-subscribed macro users.

Several approaches have been proposed for this purpose: the component approach, the radio resource management (RRM) algorithms, the cell topology adaptation mechanisms, the hybrid network architectures, the cognitive radio approach and others. However, it is rare to find proposals where two or more of these approaches are combined in order to obtain a better energy efficiency. In this paper we combine the cell breathing technique, a cell topology adaptation mechanism, with a hybrid network approach composed of small and large cell layers. Our scenario includes the possibility of users being blocked by the femto-layer due to Closed-Subscriber Groups (CSG) access policies, a concept defined in 3GPP standards but not very discussed so far in the literature. By adding the cell breathing to the macro layer, we have two ways of traffic redistribution in order to offload and deactivate a larger number of Macro-BSs achieving to take the most of benefits from the hybrid cellular infrastructure. The described proposal is compared with other related mechanisms found in the literature. Our results lead to interesting conclusions for shortterm practical implementations.","doi":"10.1109/WD.2013.6686495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2013.6686495","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679376/6686431/06686495.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a green-cell breathing technique in a hybrid access network environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a green-cell breathing technique in a hybrid access network environment","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686495/","accessionNumber":"14000971","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686495/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a green-cell breathing technique in a hybrid access network environment","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569814321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057948S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679376","isNumber":"6686431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679376","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6686431","articleId":"6686495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6686496,"authors":[{"name":"Hussien Al-Hmood","affiliation":["Wireless Network and Communications Centre (WNCC), Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hussien","lastName":"Al-Hmood","id":"37075527100"},{"name":"H.

Several proposals to offload the traffic of 3G networks have been made in the past few years, including the use of femtocells,WiFi offloading and more recently mobile-to-mobile opportunistic offloading. In this paper, we measure the public WiFi hotspots provided by the government and private WiFi access points (AP) scanned during several bus routes in Paris in order to evaluate the feasibility of offloading data traffic through WiFi. We compare the AP positions with the positions of mobile clients provided publicly in Location Sharing Services, such as Foursquare. Our main findings are that, on average, an access point is available up to 60m of range, during 30 seconds, and the already deployed WiFi infrastructure could offload up to 30% of mobile traffic in the scenario analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Mobile communication","Cities and towns","Mobile computing","Authentication","Urban areas","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","femtocellular radio","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi offloading","urban areas","Paris","mobile Internet","3G networks","4G networks","wireless Internet services providers","WISP","femtocells","mobile-to-mobile opportunistic offloading","public WiFi hotspots","WiFi access points","data traffic","location sharing services","Foursquare"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiFi Network","Data offloading","Network Characterization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686530","doi":"10.1109/WD.2013.6686530","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679376/6686431/06686530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2013.6686530","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686431","publicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the feasibility of WiFi offloading in urban areas: The Paris case study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the feasibility of WiFi offloading in urban areas: The Paris case study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686530/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686530/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14001070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the feasibility of WiFi offloading in urban areas: The Paris case study","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569818031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067082S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679376","isNumber":"6686431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679376","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6686431","articleId":"6686530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6686535,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Pastor P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier Pastor","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"37086683521"},{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0543-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"6686535","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"abstract":"This paper presents a systematic comparative study involving two fundamental mechanisms envisaged to play a crucial role in 4G networks, namely, fractional frequency reuse (FFR) and coordinated multipoint transmission (CoMP).

In recent years, a number of ingenious techniques have been proposed to deal with delayed and imperfect CSIT. In this paper we consider Finite Rate of Information (FRoI) channel models (CM) introduced earlier, which captures the DoF of the channel coefficient time series. Both the block fading model and the stationary bandlimited channel model are special cases of the FRoI CM. However, the fact that FRoI CMs model stationary channel evolutions allows to exploit one more dimension: arbitrary time shifts. In this way, the FroI CM allows Foresighted Channel Feedback (FCFB) which provides CSIT at all times, even in the presence of CSIT FB delay, by increasing the FB rate. DoF-optimal schemes in the presence of perfect CSIT then maintain optimal DoF when combined with FCFB. This is applicable to any multi-user network. In this paper we analyze NetDoFs, which account for training overhead and FB DoF consumption on the reverse link. We provide attainable NetDoF expressions in the MIMO Interference Channel (IC) with linear transceivers for the DoF-optimal schemes of Interference Alignment (IA) with FCFB and several simpler schemes. Numerical evaluations show that the attainable NetDoF may be far away from the DoF and that simpler schemes may be close to optimal in terms of NetDoF.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679376/6686431/06686540.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","doi":"10.1109/WD.2013.6686540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2013.6686540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Foresighted delayed CSIT feedback for finite rate of innovation channel models and attainable NetDoFs of the MIMO interference channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Training","Time division multiple access","Delays","Integrated circuits","Channel models","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multi-access systems","numerical analysis","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["foresighted delayed CSIT feedback","channel state information-at-the-transmitter","finite innovation channel model rate","NetDoF","MIMO interference channel","multiuser wireless networks","transmission rates","FRoI channel models","stationary channel evolutions","arbitrary time shifts","foresighted channel feedback","FCFB","DoF-optimal schemes","linear transceivers","numerical evaluations","interference alignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Foresighted delayed CSIT feedback for finite rate of innovation channel models and attainable NetDoFs of the MIMO interference channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14001058","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Foresighted delayed CSIT feedback for finite rate of innovation channel models and attainable NetDoFs of the MIMO interference channel","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"1569818111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054295S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679376","isNumber":"6686431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679376","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6686431","articleId":"6686540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6686608,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed S.

The cross-talk introduced before the power amplifier (PA) in a multi-antenna transmitter, which is termed as non-linear cross-talk degrades the performance of digital pre-distortion (DPD). A cross-over pre-distortion (CO-DPD) that compensates for the cross-talk and non-linearity in multi-antenna transmitters was proposed in [2]. However, CO-DPD ignores the higher order cross-terms between the input signals. As a result, the performance of CO-DPD degrades, as the crosstalk between the branches of the multi-antenna transmitter becomes stronger. In the CTC-DPD structure, linearization and cross-talk compensation are done separately by pre-distorters for the PAs and a cross-talk pre-cancellation block. The performances of pre-distortion techniques for a two-antenna transmitter are evaluated through measurements. It is observed that CTC-DPD achieves an error vector magnitude (EVM) improvement of 1.5% at -15 dB non-linear cross-talk and 0.8% at -20 dB non-linear crosstalk, compared to CO-DPD, for an universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) signal.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686679","publicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679726/6686544/06686679.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital pre-distortion for multiple antenna transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686679/","displayDocTitle":"Digital pre-distortion for multiple antenna transmitters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13999635","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686679/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital pre-distortion for multiple antenna transmitters","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071476S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679726","isNumber":"6686544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679726","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6686544","articleId":"6686679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6686680,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Ashok Bohara","affiliation":["LaMIPS, Laboratoire commun NXP-CRISMAT, Noisy-Le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Vivek Ashok","lastName":"Bohara","id":"37589863200"},{"name":"Mazen Abi Hussein","affiliation":["ESYCOM, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est"],"firstName":"Mazen","lastName":"Abi Hussein","id":"38273976500"},{"name":"Olivier Venard","affiliation":["LaMIPS, Laboratoire commun NXP-CRISMAT, Noisy-Le-Grand, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Venard","id":"37543246100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-031-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686680","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Predistortion","Polynomials","Simulation","Vectors","Long Term Evolution","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","Long Term Evolution","parameter estimation","polynomials","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter identification","multistage digital predistorter","digital predistortion","iterative algorithm","system-level iterations","system level simulation","multistage memory polynomial predistorters","adjacent channel power ratio","ACPR","error vector magnitude","EVM","power amplifier","Long Term Evolution-advanced signal","LTE-advanced signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-stage digital predistortion","indirect learning architecture","high power amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686680","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686544","publicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679726/6686544/06686680.pdf","startPage":"416","endPage":"419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parameter identification algorithm for multi-stage digital predistorter","abstract":"In this paper, we propose an algorithm to identify the parameters of a multi-stage digital predistorter (PD).

The linearity dependency of the linearized amplifier upon the normalization gain and the transmitted signal has been investigated. It is shown that he linearity performance of the predistorter depends on the normalization gain factor. Transmitted signal characteristics such as probability density function (pdf) or peak to average power ratio (PAPR) affect to DPD performance. Thus, different normalization gain factors will be suitable depending on the transmitted signal.

All variants are designed to operate in the WCDMA band 5 (824-849 MHz) and include a high-power and a low-power mode for two different output power ranges. The variants are identical in the high-power mode, but differ in their low-power mode biasing. They are designed with permutations between conservative (high) and aggressive (low) mirror currents, as well as a fixed bias and an adjustable bias. All four circuits switch between high-power and low-power mode and are measured with lowering the collector voltage at lower output power using a DC-DC converter. The influence of the adjustable bias on RF performance is detailed and it is proven that the chosen adjustable bias does not deteriorate circuit behaviour. Furthermore, the current consumption is compared among all four variants using DG.09 current metric. The lowest DG.09 current is achieved with the variant having small mirror currents and the adjustable bias circuit.","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686713","publicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679726/6686544/06686713.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686544","startPage":"545","endPage":"548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current consumption benefit of adjustable bias in low-power mode of WCDMA power amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Current consumption benefit of adjustable bias in low-power mode of WCDMA power amplifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686713/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13999726","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6686713/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current consumption benefit of adjustable bias in low-power mode of WCDMA power amplifiers","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04427S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679726","isNumber":"6686544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679726","xplore-issue":"6686544","articleId":"6686713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6686716,"authors":[{"name":"Pinarello Sandro","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Institute of Electronics Engineering, Germany"],"firstName":"Pinarello","lastName":"Sandro","id":"37086733875"},{"name":"Jan-Erik Mueller","affiliation":["Intel Mobile Communications, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan-Erik","lastName":"Mueller","id":"37275696900"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Institute of Electronics Engineering, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-031-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686716","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686716","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Gain","Current measurement","Power generation","Frequency measurement","Impedance","Microwave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation","power amplifiers","power transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current saving strategies","power amplifiers","back-off operation","battery current","dynamic voltage biasing","DVB","dynamic current biasing","DCB","load modulation","LM","power transistor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifiers (PAs)","power tracking","energy efficiency","microwave measurements","semiconductor device testing","millimetre wave transistors","heterojunction bipolar transistors"]}],"abstract":"Three different methodologies are compared, which are suitable for saving battery current of a power amplifier operated in back-off.

Subsequently, this antenna is bent on the surface of a roof antenna housing. The effects of geometrical mapping of the planar antenna structure to the 3D surface in terms of input matching and radiation characteristics are analyzed.

Carrier bursting PAs can improve efficiency. The properties of a carrier bursting PA and the concept of direct filter connection are briefly discussed. Based on combining the advantages of the carrier bursting PA and the direct filter connection, a concept for a highly efficient PA operation using PWM modulation of the drain voltage is proposed. By introducing a PA with two DC voltage levels it is possible to reach high coding and drain efficiency at the same time. Additionally the requirements and effects of the filter impedance at the modulation sidebands are analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Transistors","Pulse width modulation","Encoding","Amplitude modulation","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","electric impedance","encoding","power amplifiers","pulse width modulation","radio transmitters","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation sidebands","filter impedance","drain efficiency","coding","DC voltage levels","drain voltage","PWM modulation","direct filter connection","carrier bursting PA","PA efficiency","power amplifier","spectral efficiency","PAPR","peak to average power ratios","modern communication standards","direct band pass filter connection","carrier bursting RF transmitter"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686750","publicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679726/6686544/06686750.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly efficient carrier bursting RF transmitter employing direct band pass filter connection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Highly efficient carrier bursting RF transmitter employing direct band pass filter connection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686750/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13999772","conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly efficient carrier bursting RF transmitter employing direct band pass filter connection","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048628S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","isNumber":"6686544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679726","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6686750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6686751,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Preis","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Preis","id":"38232559700"},{"name":"Tareq Arnous","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Tareq","lastName":"Arnous","id":"37086664414"},{"name":"Zihui Zhang","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Zihui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537899600"},{"name":"Paul Saad","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Saad","id":"37395126700"},{"name":"Georg Boeck","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Laboratory, Berlin Institute of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Boeck","id":"37282337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-031-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686751","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":403},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686751","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Power amplifiers","Transistors","Performance evaluation","Broadband amplifiers","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","losses","power amplifiers","power combiners","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency performance","power combining","GaN HEMT power amplifiers","transistors manufacturers","output power","parasitic elements","losses","maximum bandwidth","Bode and Fano theory","power 100 W","power 50 W","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["broadband amplifier","galium nitride","HEMT","power amlifier","power combining"]}],"abstract":"Transistors manufacturers are increasing the output power of their devices presently by enlarging the gate width of the transistors.

These forms use the Hermitian symmetry of the frequency symbols to generate real OFDM signals compatible with the optical transmitters characteristics. Thus, to modulate and demodulate N frequency symbols, 2N-point inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) are needed, resulting in a doubled circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to generate real OFDM signals, using only N-point IFFT/FFT blocks. This technique consists on generating a conventional complex OFDM signal and juxtaposing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal in the time domain. The proposed technique has a saving of 55% in the number of the FFT/IFFT operations, which results in a great reduction of the power consumption and the occupied chip area. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed technique, with only N-point IFFT/FFT, exhibits the same tolerance to nonlinearity as the conventional real OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679726/6686544/06686890.pdf","startPage":"1247","endPage":"1250","publicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2013.6686890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel FFT/IFFT size efficient technique to generate real time optical OFDM signals compatible with IM/DD systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical imaging","Peak to average power ratio","Optical noise","Optical modulation","Optical distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","demodulation","fast Fourier transforms","Hermitian matrices","intensity modulation","inverse transforms","OFDM modulation","optical signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["N-point FFT-IFFT size efficient technique","complex real time optical OFDM signal generation","IM-DD systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intensity modulated direct detection","Hermitian symmetry","frequency symbol demodulation","inverse fast Fourier transform","doubled circuit complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical OFDM","IM/DD systems","FFT","IFFT","Computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel FFT/IFFT size efficient technique to generate real time optical OFDM signals compatible with IM/DD systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6686890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13999593","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel FFT/IFFT size efficient technique to generate real time optical OFDM signals compatible with IM/DD systems","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052275S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679726","isNumber":"6686544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679726","xplore-issue":"6686544","articleId":"6686890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6686904,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Norouzian","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Norouzian","id":"37085735843"},{"name":"Peter Gardner","affiliation":["School of Electronic, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Gardner","id":"37267354800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-031-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686904","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"abstract":"In this paper, a concurrent dual-band class-E power amplifier is proposed.

The method consists of combining the supply modulation that characterizes the envelope tracking architecture with supply shaping and dynamic biasing. The inclusion of dynamic biasing allows a dynamic minimization of the current consumption while imposing simultaneously a constant gain condition. In such a way we maximize the efficiency of the ET transmitter maintaining a considerable linearity. Bias and supply voltages are modulated applying specific waveforms obtained as a function of the input envelope by means of two shaping functions jointly designed on the basis of a single-tone characterization. The presented technique is demonstrated by means of measurements on a commercial GaAs HBT power amplifier. Measured results showed a PA power added efficiency (PAE) of 51.9%, an error vector magnitude (EVM) of 1.2% and an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of -39.4/-43.5 dBc. The presented transmitter architecture allowed an improvement of 12% PAE compared to a classical ET transmitter where the measured PA was biased in class-AB, maintaining the linearity indicators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6686951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6686951/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14015955","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency enhancement of an envelope tracking power amplifier combining supply shaping and dynamic biasing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency enhancement of an envelope tracking power amplifier combining supply shaping and dynamic biasing","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"2028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041818S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679726","isNumber":"6686544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679726","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6686544","articleId":"6686951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6686954,"authors":[{"name":"Mirko Palomba","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Palomba","id":"38251897500"},{"name":"Andrea Bentini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bentini","id":"37586594600"},{"name":"Riccardo Cleriti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Cleriti","id":"37085345332"},{"name":"Ernesto Limiti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Limiti","id":"37266449600"},{"name":"Mauro Ferrari","affiliation":["HW Development, Elettronica S.p.A., Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37592035700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-031-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6686954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Microwave amplifiers","Microwave communication","Microwave circuits","MMICs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain control","HEMT integrated circuits","MMIC amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pHEMT OMMIC process","X-Band MMIC VGA","gain control","input-output return losses","insertion phase","reduced phase deviation","variable gain amplifier architecture","size 0.13 mum","frequency 9.0 GHz to 10.2 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MMIC","Variable Gain Amplifiers","Microwave Attenuators","Phase Compensation","Multi-functional Chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6686954","abstract":"In this contribution, a Variable Gain Amplifier architecture with a reduced phase deviation is presented.

To achieve a lower NF and to prevent poor linearity, an inter-stage noise matching inductor and a derivative superposition method were applied to the LNA design. A thin-film microstrip (TFMS) line was used for matching networks and all interconnections. The TFMS line consists of a top metal layer (M9) serving as the signal microstrip line and a bottom metal layer (M1) serving as the ground plane. The measurement results showed that the proposed LNA exhibited the best gain performance of 22 dB at 57.3 GHz and a minimum NF of 3.7 dB at 61 GHz. The input third-order intercept point was -13 dBm.

In the system analysis, two pseudo-random BPSK signals of 2 Gb/s data rate are transmitted on two MIMO orthogonal channels. The inherent MIMO spatial and additional quadrature diversity (due to six-port interferometry) allows improvements in bit error rate (BER) when the distance changes versus the optimal Rayleigh value.

If orthogonally arranged transmit and receive arrays are used instead, the angular resolution equals that of a radar system using only a single antenna on the transmit and a full antenna array on the receiver side or vice-versa. This paper evaluates the influence of different antenna array configurations on the angular resolution capability by means of a 24GHz Digital Beamforming radar system. Besides the so-called inverted T-shaped antenna arrangement, various array geometries are discussed. Compared to the full planar antenna array the introduced geometries provide better angular resolution, while allowing for a highly reduced number of antennas, saving space and cost. Each presented antenna array is realized in hardware and the angular resolution capability is evaluated by means of a 24 GHz Digital Beamforming radar system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679726/6686544/06687002.pdf","startPage":"1695","endPage":"1698","publicationTitle":"2013 European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.23919/EuMC.2013.6687002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EuMC.2013.6687002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6686544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D antenna array geometries for MIMO radar imaging by Digital Beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Antenna arrays","Radar imaging","Radar antennas","Antenna measurements","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO radar","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverted T-shaped antenna arrangement","digital beamforming radar system","antenna array configurations","single antenna","angular resolution","transmit and receive arrays","full planar antenna arrays","elevation","azimuth","angular information","2D radar imaging applications","MIMO radar imaging","2D antenna array geometries"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"2-D antenna array geometries for MIMO radar imaging by Digital Beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687002/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14015953","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","conferenceDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D antenna array geometries for MIMO radar imaging by Digital Beamforming","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047872S","chronDate":"6-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679726","isNumber":"6686544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679726","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6686544","articleId":"6687002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6687012,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Hamouda","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hamouda","id":"38504887300"},{"name":"Francesco Scotto di Clemente","affiliation":["Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Scotto di Clemente","id":"37087178235"},{"name":"Matthias Hein","affiliation":["Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Hein","id":"37301123400"},{"name":"Georg Fischer","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37288289900"},{"name":"Robert Weigel","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Weigel","id":"37266288900"},{"name":"Thomas Ussmueller","affiliation":["Institute for Electronics Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ussmueller","id":"37586392000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-031-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6687012","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"abstract":"This work presents the design and the manufacturing of an ultra wide band amplifier integrated with a low impedance antenna for Biomedical applications.

The fiber-wireless (FiWi) network is a promising network for the NG technologies, since it is a powerful combination of optical backhaul and wireless front-end. The optical backhaul of the FiWi network is a tree network connecting the central office (CO) and wireless front-end. The wireless front-end consists of access points (APs) which are widespread to penetrate multiple WEDs. There are two main schemes to transmit the wireless signals in the FiWi system: (1) baseband-over-fiber (BBOF) transmission scheme, (2) radio over fiber (ROF) transmission scheme. This paper will review and discuss the concept and architecture of the FiWi system. This review is important to report the architectures, advantages, disadvantages, and the main parameters of these transmission schemes.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679375/6687046/06687063.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2013.6687063","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2013.6687063","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687063","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fibers","Optical receivers","Optical fiber communication","Integrated optics","Wireless communication","Optical fiber dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next generation networks","optical fibre networks","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless signals transport schemes","fiber wireless systems","next generation technologies","high data rate","broadband multiple services","scalable bandwidth","flexible communication","wireless end-users","WED","fiber wireless network","FiWi network","optical backhaul","wireless front-end","central office","access points","baseband-over-fiber transmission","BBOF","radio over fiber transmission","ROF","tree network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FiWi system","Base-band over fiber (BBOF)","Radio over fiber (ROF)","Optical external modulator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687063/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless signals transport schemes in fiber wireless systems","accessionNumber":"13990472","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687063/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless signals transport schemes in fiber wireless systems","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"g1569777105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055851S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679375","isNumber":"6687046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679375","xplore-issue":"6687046","articleId":"6687063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6687075,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Moreover, based on various turbulences the effects of atmospheric attenuation were examined using a Bessel optical filter. The highest tolerable transmission interval however found for high, moderate and low turbulence is 1.2, 1.7 and 2 km, respectively.

The three sensor points system were compared with existing Optical Orthogonal Code (OOC) and Modified Congruence Code (MQC) in terms of level of power received, supported fiber length and complexity in implementation. Slightly better received power and longer fiber length were demonstrated by the system employing MQC code but a wide gap to OOC code. However, since KS code is implemented with less number of components which tends to reduce the cost and complexity of the system which becomes obvious as the sensor points grow, KS code is recommended for the quasi distributed vibration sensing.","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2013.6687084","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679375/6687046/06687084.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2013.6687084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of OCDMA codes for quasi-distributed fiber vibration sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687084/","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of OCDMA codes for quasi-distributed fiber vibration sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13990519","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687084/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of OCDMA codes for quasi-distributed fiber vibration sensing","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"g1569788043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079615S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679375","isNumber":"6687046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679375","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6687046","articleId":"6687084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6687087,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In WDM FBGs were used as sensor alone to sense the humidity.","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2013.6687101","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679375/6687046/06687101.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2013.6687101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous vibration and humidity measurement using a hybrid WDM/OCDMA sensor network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687101/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous vibration and humidity measurement using a hybrid WDM/OCDMA sensor network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13990459","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687101/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous vibration and humidity measurement using a hybrid WDM/OCDMA sensor network","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"g1569795597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067989S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679375","isNumber":"6687046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679375","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6687046","articleId":"6687101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6687102,"authors":[{"name":"c.

Previous work considers coherent detection, which uses the amplitude (in-phase (I) component) and phase (quadrature (Q) component) of the optical power signal and achieves an accuracy of less than 1mm, but they did not consider noise. In our work, we utilize a mathematical model for photodetection with Gaussian noise. We employ 3 stages of estimation algorithms on the measurements to minimize the noise affects. The performance is evaluated using MATLAB and we achieve an accuracy of less than 2cm in the room space of 5m \u00d7 5m \u00d7 3m.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible Light Communications localization using TDOA-based coherent heterodyne detection","doi":"10.1109/ICP.2013.6687128","endPage":"249","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679375/6687046/06687128.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 4th International Conference on Photonics (ICP)","startPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICP.2013.6687128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687046","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687128","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MATLAB","Mathematical model","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","Gaussian noise","heterodyne detection","light emitting diodes","mathematics computing","optical communication","optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visible light communications localization","TDOA-based coherent heterodyne detection","VLC","light emitting diodes","LED","indoor positioning","optical power signal amplitude","optical power signal phase","in-phase component","quadrature component","photodetection","Gaussian noise","estimation algorithms","minimization","MATLAB","time difference-of-arrival","people positioning","smart device positioning","size 5 m","size 3 m"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Visible Light Communications localization using TDOA-based coherent heterodyne detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687128/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13990499","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible Light Communications localization using TDOA-based coherent heterodyne detection","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"g1569796141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051729S","chronDate":"28-30 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679375","isNumber":"6687046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679375","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6687046","articleId":"6687128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6687141,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.W.

We consider multiple QoS attributes such as response time, cost, and reliability. A selection is Pareto-optimal if no other selection has better QoS values for some attributes and at least equivalent values for all others. Exact algorithms have been proposed that find all Pareto-optimal selections. They suffer however from exponential complexity. Randomized algorithms scale well but do not offer any formal guarantees on result precision. We present the first approximation scheme for QDSS. It aims at the sweet spot between exact and randomized algorithms: It combines polynomial complexity with formal result precision guarantees. A parameter allows to seamlessly trade result precision against efficiency. We formally analyze complexity and precision guarantees and experimentally compare our algorithm against exact and randomized approaches. Comparing with exact algorithms, our approximation scheme allows to reduce optimization time from hours to seconds. Its approximation error remains below 1.4 percent while randomized algorithms come close to the theoretical maximum.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2013.61","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/6755497/06687160.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2013.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Quality-Driven Service Selection\u2014A Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687160/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Quality-Driven Service Selection\u2014A Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme","volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14144381","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687160/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Quality-Driven Service Selection\u2014A Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme","sourcePdf":"tse-trummer-61-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131916S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6755497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6755497","articleId":"6687160","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6687187,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-8860-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6687187","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":71,"totalDownloads":11392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Local area networks","Metropolitan area networks","IEEE 802.11 standards","Array signal processing","MIMO","Bandwidth allocation","Throughput","Information exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","metropolitan area networks","telecommunication services","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple multimedia-data streaming","WLAN application","BSS","basic service set","wireless local area network","PHY specification","physical layer specification","MAC","wireless LAN medium access control","metropolitan area network","information exchange","telecommunication network","information technology","IEEE 802.11ac-2013 standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["256-QAM","beamforming","IEEE 802.11ac(TM)","multi-user MIMO","noncontiguous frequency segments","very high throughput","wider bandwidth"]}],"abstract":"The purpose of this amendment is to improve the IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) user experience by providing significantly higher basic service set (BSS) throughput for existing WLAN application areas and to enable new market segments for operation below 6 GHz including distribution of multiple multimedia/data streams.","doi":"10.1109/IEEESTD.2013.6687187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Std 802.11ac-2013 (Amendment to IEEE Std 802.11-2012, as amended by IEEE Std 802.11ae-2012, IEEE Std 802.11aa-2012, and IEEE Std 802.11ad-2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Std 802.11ac-2013 (Amendment to IEEE Std 802.11-2012, as amended by IEEE Std 802.11ae-2012, IEEE Std 802.11aa-2012, and IEEE Std 802.11ad-2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687185/6687186/06687187.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2013.6687187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"802.11ac-2013 -

In this paper, we propose a decoding algorithm with reduced computational complexities and smaller memory requirements for NB-LDPC codes. First, a simplified algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of variable node processing. To reduce the memory requirements, existing NB-LDPC decoders often truncate the message vectors to a limited number n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n of values. However, the memory requirements of these decoders remain high when the field size is large. In this paper, an improved trellis-based check node processing algorithm is proposed to significantly reduce the memory requirement. The number of elements in a variable-to-check message is reduced to n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n (n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n <; n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n). The sorted log likelihood ratio (LLR) vector of a check-to-variable (c-to-v) message is approximated using a piecewise linear function. For each a priori message, most of the LLRs are approximated with a linear function. Two low complexity LLR generation units (LGUs) are proposed to compute LLR vectors for c-to-v messages. A fully parallel NB-LDPC decoder over GF(256) is implemented with 28-nm CMOS technology. The decoder over GF(256) achieves a throughput of 546 Mb/s and an energy efficiency of 0.178 nJ/b/iter.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2293224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6963544/06687216.pdf","startPage":"2649","endPage":"2660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2293224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Fully Parallel Decoder Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Fully Parallel Decoder Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687216/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14760389","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687216/","volume":"22","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-0925890 and ECCS-1055877"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Fully Parallel Decoder Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lin-2293224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156886S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6963544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6963544","articleId":"6687216","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6687229,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Ebrahimi","affiliation":["The University of Adelaide, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Adelaide, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6766215/6687229/6687229-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amir Ebrahimi (S'09) was born in Babol, Iran, on September 11, 1986.

The main part of the device is a microstrip coupled complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR). At resonance, a strong electric field will be established along the sides of CSRR producing a very sensitive area to a change in the nearby dielectric material. A micro-channel is positioned over this area for microfluidic sensing. The liquid sample flowing inside the channel modifies the resonance frequency and peak attenuation of the CSRR resonance. The dielectric properties of the liquid sample can be estimated by establishing an empirical relation between the resonance characteristics and the sample complex permittivity. The designed microfluidic sensor requires a very small amount of sample for testing since the cross-sectional area of the sensing channel is over five orders of magnitude smaller than the square of the wavelength. The proposed microfluidic sensing concept is compatible with lab-on-a-chip platforms owing to its compactness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"14","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14156897","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6687229/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Sensitivity Metamaterial-Inspired Sensor for Microfluidic Dielectric Characterization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Sensitivity Metamaterial-Inspired Sensor for Microfluidic Dielectric Characterization","sourcePdf":"jsen-ebrahimi-2295312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076984S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6766215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"355","xplore-issue":"6766215","articleId":"6687229","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6687231,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Koo Kang","affiliation":["Dasan building 617, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Buk-gu, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Min-Koo","lastName":"Kang","id":"38193550800"},{"name":"Dae-Young Kim","affiliation":["Dasan building 617, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Buk-gu, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"38554175800"},{"name":"Kuk-Jin Yoon","affiliation":["Dasan building 617, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Buk-gu, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Kuk-Jin","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38182036400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6687231","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Reliability","Image segmentation","Image edge detection","Noise","Cameras","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","image segmentation","image sequences","Markov processes","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-temporal neighbors","depth map sequence up-sampling method","sensor fusion techniques","depth map discontinuities","image edges","active range sensors","error propagation","adaptive supporting method","spatial-temporal Markov random field model","depth image-based rendering","region segmentation","bi-directed gradients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth map","kinect","TOF","up-sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687231","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2295252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2295252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6687259/06687231.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Support of Spatial\u2013Temporal Neighbors for Depth Map Sequence Up-sampling","abstract":"Depth map up-sampling methods have achieved remarkable improvement by exploiting sensor fusion techniques where they assume that the depth map discontinuities and image edges coincide, and the depth values of the temporal neighbors are stable during time variation. However, inherent noise of depth data acquired by active range sensors often violates these assumptions, and results in undesirable error propagation. To alleviate the error propagation, this letter presents a new adaptive supporting method of spatially\u2013temporally neighboring samples. On the basis of a spatial\u2013temporal Markov random field model, the weight coefficients of the smoothness terms are adaptively computed according to the reliability of neighboring samples.

An uncertain dynamic model for the offshore platform is first established, where uncertainties not only on the natural frequency and the damping ratio of both the offshore platform and the active tuned mass damper (TMD) but also on the damping and stiffness of the TMD are considered. Then, by intentionally introducing a proper time delay into the control channel, a novel sliding mode control scheme is proposed. This scheme uses information about mixed current and delayed states. It is shown through simulation results that this scheme is more effective in both improving the control performance and reducing control force of the offshore platform than some existing ones, such as delay-free sliding mode control, nonlinear control, dynamic output feedback control, and delayed dynamic output feedback control. Furthermore, it is shown that the introduced time delay in this scheme can take values in different ranges while the corresponding control performance of the offshore platform is almost at the same level.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2013.2293401","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1783","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/6863725/06687235.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2013.2293401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6863725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Mode Control With Mixed Current and Delayed States for Offshore Steel Jacket Platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vibrations","Delay effects","Force","Steel","Damping","Symmetric matrices","Sliding mode control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","delay systems","elasticity","feedback","force control","nonlinear control systems","offshore installations","perturbation techniques","steel","uncertain systems","variable structure systems","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed current states","delayed states","offshore steel jacket platforms","active control","wave-induced force","parameter perturbations","uncertain dynamic model","uncertainties","natural frequency","damping ratio","active tuned mass damper","TMD","stiffness","time delay","control channel","control performance","control force","delay-free sliding mode control","nonlinear control","delayed dynamic output feedback control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active control","offshore platform","sliding mode control","time delay","uncertainty."]},{"kwd":["Active control","offshore platform","sliding mode control","time delay","uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sliding Mode Control With Mixed Current and Delayed States for Offshore Steel Jacket Platforms","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6687235/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2014","accessionNumber":"14469726","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379029"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"2012-1707"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"Y1110036"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"2012C21022"},{"fundingName":"Academic Climbing Foundation of Youth Discipline Leaders of Universities in Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"PD2013190"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP1096780 and DP0986376"},{"fundingName":"Research Advancement Awards Scheme Program from 2010 to 2012 at Central Queensland University, Australia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding Mode Control With Mixed Current and Delayed States for Offshore Steel Jacket Platforms","sourcePdf":"tcst-han-2293401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084477S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6863725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"6863725","articleId":"6687235","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6687236,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Bazin","affiliation":["CNRS Laboratoire de Photonique et de Nanostructures, Marcoussis, France"],"bio":{"p":["Alexandre Bazin received the B.Sc., M.Sc degrees in physics, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Paris Diderot University, France in nanophotonics, in 2013.

This could be due to several factors such as circuit component mismatch, noise, clock jitter, and so on. Furthermore, coherency is a challenging task to implement in BIST as its accuracy requirement on frequency of input signal is extremely high. This paper proposes a new spectral testing method with the efficiency and accuracy similar to the straightforward fast Fourier transform, but it can simultaneously handle amplitude clipping and noncoherent sampling. By replacing a noncoherent and clipped fundamental with a coherent and unclipped fundamental, correct spectral specifications can be obtained. Simulation results show accurate spectral parameters of four ADCs with different resolutions. The proposed method is validated using measurement result of a commercial 16-bit ADC. The algorithm error is quantitatively bounded using theoretical analysis and also justified with simulation result.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Noise","Built-in

limited power supply and networks are often expected to be functional for extended periods. Therefore, the minimization of energy consumption and the maximization of network lifetime are key objectives in WSN. This paper proposes an overlay, energy optimized, sensor network to extend the functional lifetime of an energy-intensive sensor network application. The overlay network consists of additional nodes that exploit recent advances in energy harvesting and wake-up radio technologies, coupled with an application specific, complementary, ultra-low power sensor. The experimental results and simulations demonstrate that this approach can ensure survivability of energy-inefficient sensor networks. Simulating applications using energy-intensive video cameras and air quality sensors, combined with the proposed overlayed ultra-low power sensor network, demonstrates that this approach can increase functional lifetime toward perpetual operation and is suitable for WSN applications in which complementarity exists between the required energy-intensive sensors and low-cost sensors that can be used as triggers.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2013.2295198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06687258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2013.2295198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","startPage":"946","endPage":"956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensuring Survivability of Resource-Intensive Sensor Networks Through Ultra-Low Power Overlays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ensuring Survivability of Resource-Intensive Sensor Networks Through Ultra-Low Power Overlays","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687258/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267609","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6687258/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensuring Survivability of Resource-Intensive Sensor Networks Through Ultra-Low Power Overlays","sourcePdf":"tii-magno-2295198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046074S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"58","articleId":"6687258","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6687263,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous System and Network Control, College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6855384/6687263/li-2293500-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Li (M'07\u2013SM'09) received the Dr.Eng. degree in mechatronics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan, from 2003 to 2005.

First, we formulate a constrained dynamics of quadruped robots and derive a reduced-order dynamical model of motion/force. Consider an external wrench on quadruped robots; the distribution of required forces and moments on the supporting legs of a quadruped robot is handled as a tip-point force distribution and used to equilibrate the external wrench. Then, a gradient neural network is adopted to deal with the optimized objective function formulated as to minimize this quadratic objective function subjected to linear equality and inequality constraints. For the obtained optimized tip-point force and the motion of legs, we propose the hybrid motion/force control based on an adaptive neural network to compensate for the perturbations in the environment and approximate feedforward force and impedance of the leg joints. The proposed control can confront the uncertainties including approximation error and external perturbation. The verification of the proposed control is conducted using a simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2293500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2293500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6855384/06687263.pdf","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6855384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contact-Force Distribution Optimization and Control for Quadruped Robots Using Both Gradient and Adaptive Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687263/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Contact-Force Distribution Optimization and Control for Quadruped Robots Using Both Gradient and Adaptive Neural Networks","volume":"25","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450794","pubMedId":"25050944","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687263/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174045"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Programme of China","grantNumber":"2011DFA10950"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Programme of China (863)","grantNumber":"2011AA040701"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2013ZG0035"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0195"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20130172110026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contact-Force Distribution Optimization and Control for Quadruped Robots Using Both Gradient and Adaptive Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-li-2293500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119055S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6855384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6855384","articleId":"6687263","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6687269,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaowen Dong","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Dong","id":"37717039800"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"},{"name":"Pierre Vandergheynst","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Vandergheynst","id":"37285157700"},{"name":"Nikolai Nefedov","affiliation":["Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Z\u00fcrich (ETH Z\u00fcrich), Signal and Information Processing Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nikolai","lastName":"Nefedov","id":"37267670600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6687269","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1087},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687269","abstract":"Relationships between entities in datasets are often of multiple nature, like geographical distance, social relationships, or common interests among people in a social network, for example. This information can naturally be modeled by a set of weighted and undirected graphs that form a global multi-layer graph, where the common vertex set represents the entities and the edges on different layers capture the similarities of the entities in term of the different modalities. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing multi-layer graphs and propose methods for clustering the vertices by efficiently merging the information provided by the multiple modalities. To this end, we propose to combine the characteristics of individual graph layers using tools from subspace analysis on a Grassmann manifold. The resulting combination can then be viewed as a low dimensional representation of the original data which preserves the most important information from diverse relationships between entities. As an illustrative application of our framework, we use our algorithm in clustering methods and test its performance on several synthetic and real world datasets where it is shown to be superior to baseline schemes and competitive to state-of-the-art techniques. Our generic framework further extends to numerous analysis and learning problems that involve different types of information on graphs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Kernel","Optimization","Social network services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","graph theory","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer graph clustering","subspace analysis","geographical distance","social relationships","social network","weighted graph","undirected graph","multiple modalities","Grassmann manifold","original data representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-layer graphs","subspace representation","Grassmann manifold","clustering"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2295553","startPage":"905","endPage":"918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06687269.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2295553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering on Multi-Layer Graphs via Subspace Analysis on Grassmann Manifolds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Clustering on Multi-Layer Graphs via Subspace Analysis on Grassmann Manifolds","accessionNumber":"14056590","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","volume":"62","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering on Multi-Layer Graphs via Subspace Analysis on Grassmann Manifolds","sourcePdf":"tsp-dong-2295553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04753S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"103","articleId":"6687269","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6687272,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Liaoning Technical University"],"bio":{"p":["Zhiyu Wang (zywang@sia.cn) is working toward his Ph.D. degree in the State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and is also with Liaoning Technical University."]},"firstName":"Zhiyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537378900"},{"name":"Lianqing Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation"],"bio":{"p":["Lianqing Liu (lqliu@sia.cn) is a professor in the State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences."]},"firstName":"Lianqing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280779700"},{"name":"Yuechao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation"],"bio":{"p":["Yuechao Wang (ycwang@sia.cn) is a professor in the State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences."]},"firstName":"Yuechao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281424700"},{"name":"Zhidong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Advanced Robotics, Chiba Institute of Technology, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Zhidong Wang (zhidong.wang@it-chiba.ac.jp) is a professor in the Department of Advanced Robotics, Chiba Institute of Technology, Japan, and is also with the Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences."]},"firstName":"Zhidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279258300"},{"name":"Ning Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University"],"bio":{"p":["Ning Xi (xin@egr.msu.edu) is a John D.

One of the important nanoparticle manipulations is the nanoparticle transfer, in which two movements of grasping and transferring are involved. Although the two movements are directly in conflict with the single probe-based mechanism, an AFM-based robotic nanomanipulation system with a virtual nanohand has been developed to solve the conflicting issue of movements.

The method does not rely on the system power flow model. Instead, it uses only high-frequency synchronized data collected from phasor measurement units to estimate the injection shift factors through linear least-squares estimation, after which other DFs can be easily computed. Such a measurement-based approach is desirable since it is adaptive to changes in system operating point and topology. We further improve the adaptability of the proposed approach to such changes by using weighted and recursive least-squares estimation. Through numerical examples, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed DF estimation approach over the conventional model-based one in the context of contingency analysis and generation re-dispatch.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2292370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6799261/06687276.pdf","startPage":"1372","endPage":"1382","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2292370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement-Based Estimation of Linear Sensitivity Distribution Factors and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Measurement-Based Estimation of Linear Sensitivity Distribution Factors and Applications","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6687276/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239150","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement-Based Estimation of Linear Sensitivity Distribution Factors and Applications","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dominguezgarcia-2292370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095167S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6799261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6799261","articleId":"6687276","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":6687281,"authors":[{"name":"Dajiang Zhou","affiliation":["Waseda University, Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6687281/6687281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dajiang Zhou (s'08\u2013M'10) received B.E. and M.E. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Waseda University, Japan, in 2010.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with Waseda University.

This paper presents a motion estimation processor design for H.264/AVC. A test chip is implemented in 40 nm CMOS. With algorithm and architecture co-optimization, the processor delivers a maximum throughput of 1.59 Gpixel/s for 7680 \u00d7 4320 48 fps video, at least 7.5 times faster than previous designs. The corresponding core power dissipation is 622 mW at 210 MHz, with energy efficiency improved by at least 23%. The chip's DRAM bandwidth requirement is also 68% lower than previous chips. With a maximum search range of \u00b1211 (horizontal) by \u00b1106 (vertical) around a predictive search center, the proposed motion estimation processor well accommodates the high motion of UHDTV.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6777594/06687281.pdf","startPage":"827","endPage":"837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2013.2293136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2013.2293136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777594","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.59 Gpixel/s Motion Estimation Processor With -211 to +211 Search Range for UHDTV Video Encoder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Clocks","Computer architecture","Vectors","Encoding","Schedules","Loading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","DRAM chips","high definition television","integrated circuit testing","motion estimation","radiofrequency integrated circuits","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UHDTV video encoder","memory bandwidth requirement","motion distance enlargement","motion estimation processor design","H.264-AVC","CMOS technology","cooptimization","chip DRAM bandwidth requirement","predictive search center","size 40 nm","power 622 mW","frequency 210 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIC","H264/AVC","motion estimation","SHV","super hi-vision","UHDTV","ultra high definition television","video encoder","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"A 1.59 Gpixel/s Motion Estimation Processor With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-$</tex></formula>211 to +211 Search Range for UHDTV Video Encoder","volume":"49","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6687281/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14196344","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.59 Gpixel/s Motion Estimation Processor With <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-$</tex></formula>211 to +211 Search Range for UHDTV Video Encoder","sourcePdf":"jssc-zhou-2293136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079846S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6777594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6777594","articleId":"6687281","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6687282,"authors":[{"name":"Taehwan Oh","affiliation":["Oregon State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6687282/6687282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taehwan Oh (s'09\u2013M'14) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA, in 2013.","He is currently an analog design engineer at Tektronix, Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA.

This paper addresses the optimal coordination between PC and CC via a preventive-corrective security-constrained optimal power flow model. The objective is to minimize the total expected-security-control cost which is the sum of the costs of PC and CC considering the probability of the contingencies. The constraints include system operating limits in pre- and post-contingency states, the existence of the post-contingency short-term equilibrium, and the coupling constraints on the CC actions. To solve the model, a hybrid computational strategy combining evolutionary algorithm and interior-point method is developed. The solution process consists of globally searching the critical feasible region and locally optimizing the operating variables in the found region, the two procedures interact iteratively to progressively tighten the solution region leading to the final solution. The proposed model and computational strategy are demonstrated on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. To speed up the computation, parallel processing of the approach is implemented.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2293150","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2293150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799261","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6799261/06687283.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Preventive-Corrective SCOPF by a Hybrid Computational Strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687283/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Solving Preventive-Corrective SCOPF by a Hybrid Computational Strategy","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6687283/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14239156","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Preventive-Corrective SCOPF by a Hybrid Computational Strategy","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dong-2293150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08911S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6799261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6799261","articleId":"6687283","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6687285,"authors":[{"name":"Paul A.

Especially, the strong penetration of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) into the communications standards has triggered heavy investigation on multicarrier systems, leading to re-consideration of different approaches as an alternative to OFDM. The goal of the present survey is not only to provide a unified review of waveform design options for multicarrier schemes, but also to pave the way for the evolution of the multicarrier schemes from the current state of the art to future technologies. In particular, a generalized framework on multicarrier schemes is presented, based on what to transmit, i.e., symbols, how to transmit, i.e., filters, and where/when to transmit, i.e., lattice. Capitalizing on this framework, different variations of orthogonal, bi-orthogonal, and non-orthogonal multicarrier schemes are discussed. In addition, filter designs for various multicarrier systems are reviewed considering four different design perspectives: energy concentration, rapid decay, spectrum nulling, and channel/hardware characteristics. Subsequently, evaluation tools which may be used to compare different filters in multicarrier schemes are studied. Finally, multicarrier schemes are evaluated from the perspective of practical implementation aspects, such as lattice adaptation, equalization, synchronization, multiple antennas, and hardware impairments.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2013.121213.00263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6880447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.121213.00263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/6880447/06687311.pdf","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Multicarrier Communications: Prototype Filters, Lattice Structures, and Implementation Aspects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Multicarrier Communications: Prototype Filters, Lattice Structures, and Implementation Aspects","volume":"16","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687311/","publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","accessionNumber":"14527961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687311/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Multicarrier Communications: Prototype Filters, Lattice Structures, and Implementation Aspects","sourcePdf":"08Sahin263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.357698S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6687311","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6687313,"authors":[{"name":"Najah Abu-Ali","affiliation":["College of Information Technology at UAE University, UAE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6880447/6687313/6687313-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Najah Abu Ail is currently an associate professor in the Faculty of Information Technology at the University of the United Arab Emirates.

With OFDMA in the downlink and SC-FDMA in the uplink, LTE possesses a robust and adaptive multiple access scheme that facilitates many physical layer enhancements. Despite this flexibility, scheduling in LTE is a challenging functionality to design, especially in the uplink. Resource allocation in LTE is made complex, especially when considering its target packet-based services and mobility profiles, both current and emerging, in addition to the use of several physical layer enhancements. In this paper, we offer a tutorial on scheduling in LTE and its successor LTE-Advanced. We also survey representative schemes in the literature that have addressed the scheduling problem, and offer an evaluation methodology to be used as a basis for comparison between scheduling proposals in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/6880447/06687313.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2013.1127.00161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.1127.00161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6880447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Scheduling in LTE and LTE-Advanced: Tutorial, Survey and Evaluation Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Uplink","Quality of service","Downlink","Bit rate","Resource management","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink scheduling","LTE advanced","evaluation framework","survey framework","tutorial framework","multicarrier access techniques","3GPP networks","SC-FDMA","adaptive multiple access scheme","physical layer enhancements","target packet based services","mobility profiles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3GPP","LTE","LTE-Advanced","scheduling","SC-FDMA","carrier aggregation","coordinated multi-point transmission/reception","non-contiguous SC-FDMA","machine type communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Third Quarter  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Scheduling in LTE and LTE-Advanced: Tutorial, Survey and Evaluation Framework","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6687313/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Third Quarter 2014","accessionNumber":"14527946","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Scheduling in LTE and LTE-Advanced: Tutorial, Survey and Evaluation Framework","sourcePdf":"05hassanein161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098412S","chronDate":"Third Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6880447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6880447","articleId":"6687313","onlineDate":"18 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6687314,"authors":[{"name":"Shahab Mirzadeh","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research (CCSR), University of Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6734839/6687314/6687314-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahab Mirzade is a research fellow in the Centre for Communication Systems Research (CCSR), University of Surrey.

However, they provide relatively little guarantee with respect to the coherence and consistency of the memory system. Thus, GPUs are prone to multitude of concurrency bugs related to inconsistent memory states. Many such bugs manifest as some form of data races at runtime, and being able to identify these data races can help programmers improve software reliability. Mechanisms that enable efficient and effective data race detection at runtime can form the basis of powerful tools for enhancing GPU software correctness. Most prior works in data race detection for GPU focus on the software-based approaches that incur significant performance overhead. Furthermore, they often focus on the smaller shared memory, while neglecting the larger global memory. We believe that adequate hardware support can enable efficient data race detection in all levels of the memory system for GPUs. In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated data race detection mechanism, HAccRG, for efficient data race detection in GPUs. HAccRG provides hardware support for tracking data dependencies across a large number of threads and detects various forms of data races. We incorporate HAccRG on both the shared and global memory spaces in GPU. Our evaluation shows that, with moderate hardware support, HAccRG can detect data races in GPU kernels with a small overhead: 1% for the shared memory and 27% for combined shared and global memory data race detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687339/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991544","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HAccRG: Hardware-Accelerated Data Race Detection in GPUs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAccRG: Hardware-Accelerated Data Race Detection in GPUs","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"5117a060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076396S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687305","isNumber":"6687321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687305","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6687321","articleId":"6687339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6687341,"authors":[{"name":"Sreeram Potluri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"],"firstName":"Sreeram","lastName":"Potluri","id":"37902624900"},{"name":"Khaled Hamidouche","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Hamidouche","id":"37992127500"},{"name":"Akshay Venkatesh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"],"firstName":"Akshay","lastName":"Venkatesh","id":"37070204000"},{"name":"Devendar Bureddy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University"],"firstName":"Devendar","lastName":"Bureddy","id":"38468846200"},{"name":"Dhabaleswar K.

Scientific applications from a wide range of fields are being modified to take advantage of their compute power. However, data movement continues to be a critical bottleneck in harnessing the full potential of a GPU. Data in the GPU memory has to be moved into the host memory before it can be sent over the network. MPI libraries like MVAPICH2 have provided solutions to alleviate this bottleneck using techniques like pipelining. GPUDirect RDMA is a feature introduced in CUDA 5.0, that allows third party devices like network adapters to directly access data in GPU device memory, over the PCIe bus. NVIDIA has partnered with Mellanox to make this solution available for InfiniBand clusters. In this paper, we evaluate the first version of GPUDirect RDMA for InfiniBand and propose designs in MVAPICH2 MPI library to efficiently take advantage of this feature. We highlight the limitations posed by current generation architectures in effectively using GPUDirect RDMA and address these issues through novel designs in MVAPICH2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate a solution for internode GPU-to-GPU MPI communication using GPUDirect RDMA. Results show that the proposed designs improve the latency of internode GPU-to-GPU communication using MPI Send/MPI Recv by 69% and 32% for 4Byte and 128KByte messages, respectively. The designs boost the uni-directional bandwidth achieved using 4KByte and 64KByte messages by 2x and 35%, respectively. We demonstrate the impact of the proposed designs using two end-applications: LBMGPU and AWP-ODC. They improve the communication times in these applications by up to 35% and 40%, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Inter-node MPI Communication Using GPUDirect RDMA for InfiniBand Clusters with NVIDIA GPUs","publicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2013.17","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687305/6687321/06687341.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Inter-node MPI Communication Using GPUDirect RDMA for InfiniBand Clusters with NVIDIA GPUs","conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687341/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991569","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Inter-node MPI Communication Using GPUDirect RDMA for InfiniBand Clusters with NVIDIA GPUs","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"5117a080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123368S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687305","isNumber":"6687321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687305","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6687321","articleId":"6687341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6687355,"authors":[{"name":"Ryoma Sinya","affiliation":["Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Ryoma","lastName":"Sinya"},{"name":"Kiminori Matsuzaki","affiliation":["School of Information, Kochi University of Technology"],"firstName":"Kiminori","lastName":"Matsuzaki","id":"37855951300"},{"name":"Masataka Sassa","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical and Computing Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Sassa","id":"38158695300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5117-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6687355","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automata","Computational modeling","Parallel processing","Equations","Electronic mail","Program processors","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","finite automata","multiprocessing systems","parallel processing","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous finite automata","data parallel model","regular expression matching","parallel implementation","finite automaton","simultaneous finite automaton","SFA","parallel computation","dual hexa-core CPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automata","Data Parallel","Regular Expression","Syntactic Monoid"]}],"abstract":"Automata play important roles in wide area of computing and the growth of multicores calls for their efficient parallel implementation.

The key idea is to extend an automaton so that it involves the simulation of transitions. Since an SFA itself has a good property of parallelism, we can develop easily a parallel implementation without overheads.

Our library currently provides hybrid for-each and map-reduce. It hides the details of parallelization, work distribution and computation offloading from users while using internally TBB as its foundation. Despite the higher level of abstraction provided by our library we show that for certain types of applications we outperform codes that rely on the built-in offload support currently provided by the Intel compiler. We have performed a set of experiments with the library and created guidelines that help the developers decide in which situations they should use the HyPHI library.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687305/6687321/06687361.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2013.37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HyPHI - Task Based Hybrid Execution C++ Library for the Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Libraries","Message systems","Software","Parallel processing","Standards","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","coprocessors","parallel processing","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HyPHI library","task based hybrid execution C++ library","Intel TBB C++ library","threading building blocks","Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor","shared-memory machines","hybrid parallel model","task parallelism","work distribution","computation offloading","abstraction level","offload support","Intel compiler"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"HyPHI - Task Based Hybrid Execution C++ Library for the Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687361/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991601","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HyPHI - Task Based Hybrid Execution C++ Library for the Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"5117a280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082246S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687305","isNumber":"6687321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687305","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6687321","articleId":"6687361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6687365,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 I.

The parallel sort, referred to as Fusion Sort, partitions the sort keys between the CPU and GPU devices and utilizes the integrated memory system of the APU to avoid data copying between the devices. We identify three design issues that impact overhead and performance: the granularity of sharing between the two devices, the scheme of data partitioning and the allocation of data in memory regions accessible by each device. We present three variants of Fusion Sort that share data at coarse and fine granularities and with fixed and variable data partitioning schemes. In each variant, data is allocated to minimize the overhead of non-preferred memory accesses of each device. Our evaluation shows that fine-grain sharing with variable data partitioning performs the best. Further, Fusion Sort outperforms CPU-only and GPU-only parallel radix sorts by up to 1.8X and 1.9X respectively. These results demonstrate the viability of the integrated memory system of the APU in the context of sorting.","publicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687305/6687321/06687367.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Radix Sort on the AMD Fusion Accelerated Processing Unit","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2013.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.43","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Radix Sort on the AMD Fusion Accelerated Processing Unit","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991592","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687367/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Radix Sort on the AMD Fusion Accelerated Processing Unit","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"5117a339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048228S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687305","isNumber":"6687321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687305","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6687321","articleId":"6687367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6687368,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Dept.

If we can accurately classify program execution intervals into phases, and use such information to accurately predict the next phase at runtime, we will be able to apply suitable optimization on the subsequent intervals. Such runtime optimization opportunity not only exists in single-threaded programs but also in multithreaded programs In this paper, we propose a framework that collects code signature of each interval from individual threads of a multi-threaded parallel program, and classify them into phases at runtime. We then use the classification results to predict the next phase in an on-line fashion. In order to efficiently classify execution intervals on-line, we only keep a fixed number of representative data in a shared table for classification purpose. The classification is very efficient and uses less than 3K bytes of memory. We also propose a confidence table to improve the prediction rate. Our experiment results with the Spec OMP2001 and the PARSEC benchmark suites on an Intel Xeon multi-core show that our system can classify intervals into phases with high homogeneity, can predict the next phase with 65% accuracy without using confidence table and with 80% accuracy when confidence table is used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687368/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991600","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-Based Phase Classification and Prediction for Multi-threaded Program Execution on Multi-core Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-Based Phase Classification and Prediction for Multi-threaded Program Execution on Multi-core Architectures","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"5117a349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051852S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687305","isNumber":"6687321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687305","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6687321","articleId":"6687368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6687378,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Tziritas","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Tziritas","id":"37394276300"},{"name":"Cheng-Zhong Xu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-Zhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278305300"},{"name":"Thanasis Loukopoulos","affiliation":["Technological Educational Institute of Lamia"],"firstName":"Thanasis","lastName":"Loukopoulos","id":"37282886000"},{"name":"Samee Ullah Khan","affiliation":["North Dakota State University, USA"],"firstName":"Samee Ullah","lastName":"Khan","id":"37286195400"},{"name":"Zhibin Yu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085380871"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5117-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6687378","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Energy consumption","Virtual machining","Computer aided manufacturing","Optimization","Power demand","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","energy consumption","Pareto optimisation","power aware computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-aware workload consolidation","energy consumption minimization","network load minimization","cloud environments","virtual machine","objective functions","network overhead","VM packing algorithms","nondominating solutions","physical servers","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["workload consolidation","virtual machine placement","network load minimization","Pareto optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we tackle the problem of virtual machine (VM) placement onto physical servers to jointly optimize two objective functions. The first objective is to minimize the total energy spent within a cloud due to the servers that are commissioned to satisfy the computational demands of VMs. The second objective is to minimize the total network overhead incurred due to: (a) communicational dependencies between VMs, and (b) the VM migrations performed for the transition from an old assignment scheme to a new one. We study different methodologies for solving the aforementioned problem. The first approach is based on VM packing algorithms that optimize the above objective functions separately, reaching a single solution. The other approach is to tackle simultaneously the two optimization targets and define a set of non-dominating solutions.

The strength of the approach lies in the agents' ability to apply different types of knowledge (expressed in the form of declarative constraints) to prune the local space of folding alternatives.

Among many RAID-6 implementations, one set of codes called Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, aim to offer data protection against disk failures with optimal storage efficiency. Since today's large data centers typically shift to the services of cloud computing, a challenging issue is how to accelerate the scaling process of RAID-6 systems based on MDS codes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MDS Code Scaling Framework (MDS-Frame), which is a unified management scheme on various MDS codes to achieve high scalability. It bridges various MDS codes for flexible scaling via several intermediate codes.

It is used with other Hadoop components like MapReduce, HDFS, and HBase in real world data-centers, e.g. Facebook and Yahoo!. However, the current Hadoop RPC design is built on Java sockets interface, which limits its potential performance. The High Performance Computing community has exploited high throughput and low latency networks such as InfiniBand for many years. In this paper, we first analyze the performance of current Hadoop RPC design by unearthing buffer management and communication bottlenecks, that are not apparent on the slower speed networks. Then we propose a novel design (RPCoIB) of Hadoop RPC with RDMA over InfiniBand networks. RPCoIB provides a JVM-bypassed buffer management scheme and utilizes message size locality to avoid multiple memory allocations and copies in data serialization and deserialization. Our performance evaluations reveal that the basic ping-pong latencies for varied data sizes are reduced by 42%-49% and 46%-50% compared with 10GigE and IPoIB QDR (32Gbps), respectively, while the RPCoIB design also improves the peak throughput by 82% and 64% compared with 10GigE and IPoIB. As compared to default Hadoop over IPoIB QDR, our RPCoIB design improves the performance of the Sort benchmark on 64 compute nodes by 15%, while it improves the performance of CloudBurst application by 10%. We also present thorough, integrated evaluations of our RPCoIB design with other research directions, which optimize HDFS and HBase using RDMA over InfiniBand. Compared with their best performance, we observe 10% improvement for HDFS-IB, and 24% improvement for HBase-IB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such design of the Hadoop RPC system over high performance networks such as InfiniBand.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2013.78","publicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687305/6687321/06687402.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Performance Design of Hadoop RPC with RDMA over InfiniBand","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Design of Hadoop RPC with RDMA over InfiniBand","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13991564","htmlLink":"/document/6687402/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Design of Hadoop RPC with RDMA over InfiniBand","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"5117a641.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064935S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687305","isNumber":"6687321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687305","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6687321","articleId":"6687402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6687407,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon Inggs","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Inggs","id":"37681149500"},{"name":"David Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37289926400"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5117-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"6687407","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687407","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Field programmable gate arrays","Europe","Benchmark testing","Contracts","Multicore processing","Cost accounting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","financial data processing","multiprocessing systems","pricing","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous computing framework","forward financial framework","computational finance problem specification","heterogeneous platforms","multicore CPU","FPGA","automatic mapping","high-level problem description","domain-specific knowledge","software architecture","pricing tasks","partition pricing problems","option pricing problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous Computing","Computational Finance","Multicore CPU","FPGA","Application Framework","Domain-Specific"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2013.82","endPage":"697","startPage":"688","publicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687305/6687321/06687407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2013.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heterogeneous Computing Framework for Computational Finance","abstract":"This paper presents the Forward Financial Framework (F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n), an application framework for describing and implementing forward looking financial computations on high performance, heterogeneous platforms.

With the primary-side control, the system area and cost can be reduced. The proposed controller samples the feedback voltage on the auxiliary winding, which is proportional to the output voltage plus the turn-on voltage of the output diode. A simple knee point detector is adopted to ensure the sampling is near the instant when the inductor current is zero. Thus, the feedback voltage is more accurate under various load conditions because the diode voltage is not affected by the diode current. Since the auxiliary winding voltage can not accurately reflect the output voltage under low input voltage condition, the duty ratio is kept as constant under this condition. Thus, good load regulation can be achieved. Finally, the chip is integrated with TSMC 0.25 um CMOS high voltage mixed signal general purpose process.","doi":"10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687548","publicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678836/6687459/06687548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687459","startPage":"449","endPage":"453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IC design of primary-side control for flyback converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IC design of primary-side control for flyback converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687548/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977287","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687548/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IC design of primary-side control for flyback converter","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"449S1841162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064843S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678836","isNumber":"6687459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678836","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6687459","articleId":"6687548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6687565,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37367501700"},{"name":"Thi Ha Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Thi Ha","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086114437"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0073-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0071-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6687565","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Niobium","Zirconium","Power systems","Generators","Random access memory","Ferroelectric films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","damping","fuzzy control","machine control","nonlinear systems","PI control","short-circuit currents","time-domain analysis","transient response","turbogenerators","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DFIG-based wind turbine generator","damping improvement","infinite bus","fuzzy logic controller","electromechanical oscillations","doubly-fed induction generator","WTG","transient response","PI damping controller","time-domain approach","nonlinear system","three-phase short-circuit fault"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687565","doi":"10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687459","publicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678836/6687459/06687565.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping improvement of a DFIG-based wind turbine generator connected to an infinite bus using a fuzzy logic controller","abstract":"This paper presents the design steps and design results of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that can be used to enhance the damping of the electromechanical oscillations of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine generator (WTG) connected to an infinite bus.

The proposed QSMRC successfully combine the inherent robustness of sliding-mode control (SMC) and the harmonic suppression capability of RC. Further improved THD performance is realized compared with RC. Moreover, the proposed QSMRC provides similarly excellent transient response as SMC. It significantly improves the system robustness and dynamic performance. The theoretical analysis and the promising features are verified by simulation comparisons based on PSIM models. The proposed QSMRC method performs high steady-state precision, fast dynamic response and low THD for voltage source inverters.","doi":"10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687595","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678836/6687459/06687595.pdf","startPage":"711","endPage":"715","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","publicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fixed-frequency quasi sliding-mode repetitive control (QSMRC) for voltage source inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A fixed-frequency quasi sliding-mode repetitive control (QSMRC) for voltage source inverters","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13977234","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687595/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fixed-frequency quasi sliding-mode repetitive control (QSMRC) for voltage source inverters","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"711S2911184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07111S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678836","isNumber":"6687459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678836","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6687459","articleId":"6687595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6687596,"authors":[{"name":"Aromhack Saysanasongkham","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Aromhack","lastName":"Saysanasongkham","id":"38540516900"},{"name":"Satoshi Fukumoto","affiliation":["College of Industrial Technology, Nihon University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Fukumoto","id":"37269632700"},{"name":"Masayuki Arai","affiliation":["System Design, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Arai","id":"37280137700"},{"name":"Shun Takeuchi","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37086738090"},{"name":"Keiji Wada","affiliation":["School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Wada","id":"37274051500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0073-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0071-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6687596","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Reliability","Noise","Educational institutions","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability","invertors","power control","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling method","highly reliable digital control power converter","synchronous sampling method","duty ratio","switching noise","current sensors","AD converters","FPGA","field programmable gate array","overshoot noises","undershoot noises","sampling points"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687596","abstract":"Synchronous sampling method is commonly applied to digital control power converter circuits in various applications. However, when the duty ratio of the converter is extremely high or low, this method may be affected by switching noise via current sensors or AD converters, resulting in inaccurate output of the power converter circuit. As a countermeasure, this paper proposes an adaptive sampling method for a digital control power converter circuit on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). To avoid overshoot and undershoot noises during the switching operations, sampling points of the AD converter will be tuned adaptively regarding the duty ratio of each switching cycle.

This proposed technology can be used in the battery management system of mobile phones, power tools, electric vehicles, or hybrid electric vehicles. For life cycle testing, 60 Li-Co batteries were used to study the characteristics of the SOC. The voltage at the current sampling time and the previous two sampled voltages, the sampling time, and the present discharging current are used as the SOC patterns. The sampling time mentioned above will be affected by the current SOC. The sampling time during the normal SOC is constant but the sampling time near the very high SOC and the very low SOC is shorter due to the faster voltage variation. The fuzzy inference system (FIS) based fuzzy neural network (FNN) with the ability of training and learning was used in this study to predict the SOC of the battery. The experimental results show that the prediction of SOC using FNN is performed better with the training data taken from 36 Li-Co battery testing. The average error is -0.4%, the standard deviation is 5.3%, and the maximum error is 17.7%, and the computation time to predict the SOC is less than 148 ms. The experimental results depict that the SOC of Li-Co battery can be predicted quite accurate and than can be used for the online prediction.","doi":"10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687628","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678836/6687459/06687628.pdf","startPage":"891","endPage":"896","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","publicationTitle":"2013 1st International Future Energy Electronics Conference (IFEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFEEC.2013.6687628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of state of charge for Li-Co batteries with fuzzy inference system based fuzzy neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of state of charge for Li-Co batteries with fuzzy inference system based fuzzy neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13977167","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687628/","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of state of charge for Li-Co batteries with fuzzy inference system based fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"891P02101161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051853S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678836","isNumber":"6687459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678836","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6687459","articleId":"6687628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6687642,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These methods apply windows to divide each scanline into segments and each segment has its own focus at the center. One method uses constant window size and the other applies dynamic window size that equalizes the off-focus beamforming delay errors among the windows at different depths. The frame rates and the axial and laterial beam profiles of a point scatterer are compared using simulated and experimental echo signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 6th 2013 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678835/6687633/06687642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"The 6th 2013 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","doi":"10.1109/BMEiCon.2013.6687642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEiCon.2013.6687642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming complexity reduction methods for low-cost FPGA-based implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Focusing","Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Ultrasonic imaging","Random access memory","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomedical ultrasonics","delays","field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming complexity reduction methods","low-cost FPGA-based implementation","field-programmable gate array","dynamic window size","off-focus beamforming delay errors","axial beam profiles","laterial beam profiles","point scatterer","simulated echo signals","experimental echo signals","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beamforming","FPGA","dynamic receive beamforming","ultrasound imaging system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming complexity reduction methods for low-cost FPGA-based implementation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974370","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming complexity reduction methods for low-cost FPGA-based implementation","confLoc":"Amphur Muang, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0091569796217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068759S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678835","isNumber":"6687633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678835","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6687633","articleId":"6687642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6687673,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The classification task using a back propagation learning algorithm is applied to the multilayer perceptron architecture of NN classifiers. To yield a high classification performance, the main focus of interests is feature extraction task using four texture features: correlation, autocorrelation, the information measure of correlation and fractal dimension. A combination of these texture features is used in 60 images for training data set and 104 images for testing data set. The comparison of performances between each texture feature and the combination of them has been reported. The results show that the best classification accuracy obtained from the all features is 94.23%. This indicated that the texture analysis and NN classifier are feasible for dividing the HS in BC microscopic images and can be applied to improve and to develop an accurate cell counting of computer-aided systems for BC diagnosis.","doi":"10.1109/BMEiCon.2013.6687673","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678835/6687633/06687673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"The 6th 2013 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","publicationTitle":"The 6th 2013 Biomedical Engineering International Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEiCon.2013.6687673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifying breast cancer regions in microscopic image using texture analysis and neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Classifying breast cancer regions in microscopic image using texture analysis and neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13974319","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6687673/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifying breast cancer regions in microscopic image using texture analysis and neural network","confLoc":"Amphur Muang, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0401569795399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066782S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678835","isNumber":"6687633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678835","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6687633","articleId":"6687673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6687706,"authors":[{"name":"Pathrawut Klaynin","affiliation":["Technology of Information System Management Program, Mahidol University, Nakom Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pathrawut","lastName":"Klaynin","id":"37086715284"},{"name":"Waranyu Wongseree","affiliation":["Technology of Information System Management Program, Mahidol University, Nakom Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Waranyu","lastName":"Wongseree","id":"37660928900"},{"name":"Adisorn Leelasantitham","affiliation":["Technology of Information System Management Program, Mahidol University, Nakom Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Adisorn","lastName":"Leelasantitham","id":"37370692900"},{"name":"Supaporn Kiattisin","affiliation":["Technology of Information System Management Program, Mahidol University, Nakom Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Supaporn","lastName":"Kiattisin","id":"37547901500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1467-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1466-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6687706","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Wavelet transforms","Neural networks","Heart","Input variables","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","bioelectric potentials","cardiovascular system","diseases","electrocardiography","graph theory","medical signal processing","muscle","neural nets","regression analysis","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiogram classification method","neural network","cardiovascular disease detection method","cardiac compression","heart muscle cells","Sinus node electrical current","head room muscles","P wave flow","AV Node","QRS complex","normal myocardial preview graph","ECG beats","feedforward backpropergation method","logistic regression variable selection method","variable selection method","ECG data","MIT-BIH arrhythmia database","atrial premature contraction","premature ventricular contraction","right bundle branch block","left bundle branch block","ECG signal model","cardiac cycle","T wave","U wave"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variable Selection","classify the ECG","Electrocardiogram","Neural Network","wavelet transformation","wavelet filter","DC offset","feedforward backpropergation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687706","abstract":"The ECG is a method for the detection of cardiovascular disease is simple and effective.

The objective of variable selection is reduce a variable of ECG beat, it will be improving classification, providing faster and avoid over fitting situation. We tested both methods so variable selection method. The ECG Data from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database for classify 5 types. These are atrial premature contraction, Normal, left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block and Premature ventricular contraction.

Passive couplers showed maximum imbalance in amplitude and phase of less than 1 dB and 4 degrees, respectively. A half Gilbert-cell based unit mixer including the passive balun for the RF output exhibits approximately 15 dB-conversion loss over a 40-GHz frequency span with a single-end IF input and -5-dBm LO pumping at 300 GHz, when single bias of -4 V and total current of around 10 mA are applied.

We consider the scenario in which the undetected false status of circuit breakers from topology error processing may lead to wrong modeling of real-time network topology, which, in turn, misleads the results of state estimation and real-time economic dispatch. In particular, we focus on the economic impact of this circuit breaker-induced network topology error on locational marginal price (LMP). The primary goal of this paper is to derive a simple LMP sensitivity index that accounts for the relationship between the change in network topology and LMP. The proposed sensitivity index provides system operators a simple but effective screening of the impact of topology errors on real-time LMP. The validity of the derived sensitivity index is verified and illustrated with numerical examples in the IEEE-14 bus system.","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687933","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678912/6687920/06687933.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6687933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact analysis of locational marginal price subject to power system topology errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6687933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6687933/","displayDocTitle":"Impact analysis of locational marginal price subject to power system topology errors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977370","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6687933/","conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact analysis of locational marginal price subject to power system topology errors","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p55choi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06512S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678912","isNumber":"6687920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678912","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6687920","articleId":"6687933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6687939,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086632851"},{"name":"H.

In recent literature on EVs, reliable and cost-efficient grid operations under high EV penetrations assume the need of EV charging load control. In this scenario, EV charging (and discharging) must be adapted in real time to current grid constraints and sudden grid status changes. However, for realizing these load control functions, grids and EVs should trust each other before executing the operation. Whenever an EV is plugged into a grid for charging, it must be authenticated by the grid; otherwise, EVs and grids are open to security threats that could result in serious safety hazards and billing issues. In this paper, we first view the EV authentication problem as a mutual-authentication problem within a mobile and hostile machine-to-machine (M2M) communication setting. We describe a mutual authentication system tamper-resistant and scalable mutual authentication framework TSAF that can support large-scale grid-connected EV charging.

As more and more dispersed wind energy suppliers connect to the system for electricity supply, the power system suffers from increased operation cost and risk caused by the discrepant interests of energy suppliers and the utility company. Energy suppliers may only concern about maximizing their own profits by pushing as much energy into the grid as possible, while neglecting the risk of steep ramps in wind generation. In this paper, exploiting the two-way communication capability in smart grid, we propose interactive ramp control of wind energy integration by aligning the individual pursuits of the energy suppliers and the utility company for social welfare maximization. The optimal wind energy integration and generator ramp control are investigated in an offline social welfare optimization problem assuming full knowledge of future wind energy and load demand. Moreover, the benefits of storage are exploited in our proposed storage-aided generation range adaption scheme to reduce the potential risk caused by inaccurate wind energy forecasts and the ramping latency of slow generators. Furthermore, a suboptimal storage-aided generation range adaption scheme with low computational complexity is presented for online control of wind integration when wind energy forecasts are unavailable. Our simulation results show that interactive ramp control is necessary to achieve efficient and secure wind energy integration and with the aid of storage, the power system's ramping capability can be improved at lower operation cost.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688032","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678912/6687920/06688032.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"653","doi":"10.1109/SmartGridComm.2013.6688032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal storage-aided wind generation integration considering ramping requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal storage-aided wind generation integration considering ramping requirements","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6688032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977295","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688032/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal storage-aided wind generation integration considering ramping requirements","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p648xiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073652S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678912","isNumber":"6687920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678912","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6687920","articleId":"6688032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6688036,"authors":[{"name":"John W.

In particular, operators face the risk of not scheduling enough traditional generators when renewable generation becomes lower than expected. This paper studies the optimal trade-off between the system risk and the cost of scheduling reserve generators. The problem is modeled as a multi-period stochastic control problem, and in particular the ramping constraints on the generators are explicitly considered. The structure of the optimal dispatch control is identified. Based on the derived structure results, two types of control policies are proposed to efficiently compute the optimal dispatch: (i) a chance constrained policy, and (ii) efficient look-ahead policies. Utilizing real system data, the chance constrained dispatch is shown to outperform the look-ahead policies and to be robust to changes in the probability distribution of the uncertainties involved in the problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6688056/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977336","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Risk limiting dispatch with ramping constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk limiting dispatch with ramping constraints","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"p791qin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052357S","chronDate":"21-24 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678912","isNumber":"6687920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678912","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6687920","articleId":"6688056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6688136,"authors":[{"name":"Amrita Sahu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Amrita","lastName":"Sahu","id":"38243399900"},{"name":"Firdous Saleheen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Firdous","lastName":"Saleheen","id":"38243522500"},{"name":"Vira Oleksyuk","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Vira","lastName":"Oleksyuk","id":"37074618400"},{"name":"Yi Chen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407076400"},{"name":"Chang-Hee Won","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Chang-Hee","lastName":"Won","id":"37287389600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4642-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6688136","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Tumors","Image sensors","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cancer","hyperspectral imaging","image fusion","mammography","medical image processing","tactile sensors","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tactile sensors","hyperspectral imaging sensors","mammary tumor characterization","malignant tumors","canine breast cancer","fused tactile-hyperspectral data"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we developed and tested both a tactile as well as a hyperspectral imaging sensor, which exploit the physiological and mechanical changes that occur in malignant tumors.

Parametric resonance techniques applied to inertial sensors requires a periodic stiffness modulation, as expressed by the Mathieu equation, and is generally implemented using gap-varying and non-overlapping combs. MEMS vibratory gyroscopes provide the opportunity for applying parametric amplification for both the sensing and driving modes. While gap-varying combs are efficiently used for small displacements (e.g. the sensing mode), larger displacements require a different approach, where slope-shaped combs are a good alternative. Analytical model of slope shaped combs is carried out and compared with experimental characterization of fabricated devices. The analytical model predicts a spring modulation of 0.1%-0.65% spring modulation for 10 V to 40V applied common mode DC bias, and it can be increased for steeper slopes. The parametric amplification operation was experimentally tested using linear differential voltage actuation on the area-varying combs and a phase-synchronised common mode voltage (using a PXIe 1062Q DAQ controller) applied to the left and right shaped combs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Springs","Fingers","Modulation","Electrostatics","Force","Sensors","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["displacement measurement","electrostatic actuators","gyroscopes","microfabrication","microsensors","modulation","parametric amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PXIe 1062Q DAQ controller","phase-synchronised common mode voltage","area-varying comb","linear differential voltage actuation","common mode DC bias","spring modulation prediction","MEMS vibratory gyroscope","nonoverlapping comb","gap-varying comb","Mathieu equation","periodic stiffness modulation","parametric resonance technique","microdisplacement","electrostatic parametric amplification","slope-shaped comb","inertial MEMS sensor","voltage 10 V to 40 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2013.6688242","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2013 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2013 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679330/6688115/06688242.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2013.6688242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shaped combs and parametric amplification in inertial MEMS sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shaped combs and parametric amplification in inertial MEMS sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688242/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688242/","accessionNumber":"13977633","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shaped combs and parametric amplification in inertial MEMS sensors","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"7665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043345S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679330","isNumber":"6688115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679330","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6688115","articleId":"6688242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6688248,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In these situations in fact, it is not possible to use the traditional rectifying methods. The system presented here is composed of a PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) layer that produces an alternate voltage in response to the external vibrations, a mechanical bistable switch (driven by the same vibration source) and a storage circuit.

The muscle is composed of three main components: elastomer air chamber, embedded Kevlar threads, and a helical microchannel filled with a liquid conductor. When the air chamber is inflated with compressed air, the constrained length of the Kevlar threads causes the muscle to contract in the axial direction. During this contraction, the microchannel can detect the shape change of the muscle by sensing, the expansion of the air chamber. This sensing capability increases the controllability of pneumatic muscles. A novel manufacturing method is proposed to embed Kevlar threads and a helical microchannel in an elastomer tube. Then, a liquid metal is injected into the microchannel to make a soft sensor that can detect the geometrical change of the muscle. The muscle prototype was characterized to demonstrate its actuation and sensing capability.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2013.6688298","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2013 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2013 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679330/6688115/06688298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2013.6688298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688115","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart pneumatic artificial muscle actuator with embedded microfluidic sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart pneumatic artificial muscle actuator with embedded microfluidic sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688298/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13977622","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6688298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart pneumatic artificial muscle actuator with embedded microfluidic sensing","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"7880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094993S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679330","isNumber":"6688115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679330","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6688115","articleId":"6688298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6688323,"authors":[{"name":"Morgan Madec","affiliation":["ICube laboratory, CNRS, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Morgan","lastName":"Madec","id":"37395046200"},{"name":"Laurent Osberger","affiliation":["ICube laboratory, CNRS, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Osberger","id":"37085416570"},{"name":"Luc H\u00e9brard","affiliation":["ICube laboratory, CNRS, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"H\u00e9brard","id":"37298536000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4642-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"6688323","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"abstract":"The Vertical Hall Device integrable in a shallow N-well, and thus compatible with Low-Voltage CMOS processes, i.e. the LV-VHD, was proposed five years ago. Its layout is similar to the layout of the HV-VHD, i.e. the conventional 5-contact VHD integrated in the deep N-well of High-Voltage processes. However, in the LV-VHD, the Hall voltage is picked-up from the external contacts while it is picked-up from the internal contacts in the HV-VHD. Such sensing schemes make not obvious the application of the well-known Spinning-Current Technique (SCT) used in Horizontal Hall Device (HHD) for offset and 1/f noise attenuation. In this paper, an accurate Finite Element Modeling (FEM) analysis of the SCT for VH-Devices is presented. All the second-order effects which influence the VHD, i.e. the Junction Field Effect (JFE) and the Carrier Velocity Saturation (CVS), are taken into account. Simulation results carried out on a LV-VHD show that SCT remains efficient even under high current biasing, i.e. when CVS takes place.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2013

A simple topology based on a non-linear element in a feedback loop is employed for converting the Cell-Culture Under Test (CCUT) into a suitable \u201cbiological\u201d oscillator. Then, the oscillator parameters (frequency, amplitude, phase, etc...) are used as empirical markers to carry out an appropriate interpretation in terms of cell size identification, cell counting, cell growth, etc. The Describing Function (DF) approach employed, for the involved mathematical calculations in the analysis of the \u201cbiological circuit\u201d, predicting the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations.

The tags modulate sensor information using analog frequency modulation (FM) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) at the subcarrier frequency, even though a single carrier is assumed. In sharp contrast to prior art, the developed backscatter sensor network performs environmental monitoring over a relatively wide area.

The image sensor is comprised of an array of configurable pixels. Configurable pixels can be programmed to work as tiny solar cells or as photosensors. To work as photo-sensors, the in-pixel photodiode is reverse biased. To work as a solar cell, the reverse bias network is disconnected allowing the photodiode to work in the photovoltaic region. As a proof of concept, an image sensor consisting of a 32 \u00d7 32 pixel array has been designed and fabricated in a standard 0.5 m CMOS process.

Based on the presented analysis it results a VGA embedding 7 stages is able to achieve 84 dB gain range and it represents the best choice with respect to optimizing both the VGA power consumption and its linearity performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMICND.2013.6688652","publicationTitle":"CAS 2013 (International Semiconductor Conference)","displayPublicationTitle":"CAS 2013 (International Semiconductor Conference)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6663740/6688629/06688652.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","doi":"10.1109/SMICND.2013.6688652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining the optimal number of gain stages of variable gain amplifiers used in multi-standard homodyne wireless receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Determining the optimal number of gain stages of variable gain amplifiers used in multi-standard homodyne wireless receivers","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6688652/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974231","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688652/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining the optimal number of gain stages of variable gain amplifiers used in multi-standard homodyne wireless receivers","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"082SessionIC14pag193196Spirido.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054905S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6663740","isNumber":"6688629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6663740","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6688629","articleId":"6688652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6688662,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In any relay assisted system, in order to achieve diversity, the destination terminal should combine the replicas of the information signal from the source and relay terminals. The two replicas should be sent in orthogonal channels such as either in different time slots or different frequency bands for successful detection at the destination. Unlike the previous studies, in this paper we propose amplify and forward cooperative diversity strategy where the relays operate in the same band and in the same time slot for the direct sequence complementary coded CDMA (DS/CC-CDMA) networks. In traditional CDMA networks with conventional code sets, it is not possible for the relays operate in the same band and in the same time slot. This work shows that the complementary coded CDMA networks can accommodate in-band and in-time relay terminals without any interference.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688748","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678911/6688738/06688748.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-band amplify and forward cooperative diversity for the orthogonal complementary coded CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688748/","displayDocTitle":"In-band amplify and forward cooperative diversity for the orthogonal complementary coded CDMA networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974467","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688748/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-band amplify and forward cooperative diversity for the orthogonal complementary coded CDMA networks","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p103kizilirmak.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056761S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678911","isNumber":"6688738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678911","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6688738","articleId":"6688748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6688749,"authors":[{"name":"Syamsul Bahri Mohamad","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Center, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Syamsul Bahri","lastName":"Mohamad","id":"37086743976"},{"name":"Chee Yen Leow","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Center, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chee Yen","lastName":"Leow","id":"37589805800"},{"name":"Tharek Abdul Rahman","affiliation":["Wireless Communication Center, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tharek Abdul","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085342312"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0156-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0155-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7843"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-7851"}],"articleNumber":"6688749","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Simulation","Wireless communication","OFDM","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","Long Term Evolution","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interband carrier aggregation","Long Term Evolution Advanced","LTE-A","relay placement","cell edge user capacity","asymmetrical coverage","downlink","path-loss exponent","interband gaps","link budget","eNodeB","eNB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relay placement","asymmetrical coverage","carrier aggregation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688749","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688749","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","abstract":"Relaying and carrier aggregation are two main features of Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) that improve the transmission and increase the capacity of the network. Besides, enhance the overall capacity inside the coverage area of a relay. A relay can be used to solve the problem of capacity fairness for non-overlapped region produced by the lower frequency component carrier in inter-band carrier aggregation. This paper proposes a new approach of relay placement to enhance the capacity of cell edge user in inter-band carrier aggregation scenario with asymmetrical coverage. A simulation model for LTE-A in the downlink has been developed to investigate the impact of relay placement. The simulation result shows that a relay can be placed inside the overlapped coverage region to enhance the capacity of the cell edge user. The study suggests that for average cases a relay should be placed closer to the middle of the cell produced by lower frequency component carrier. For extreme cases with higher path-loss exponent and for larger interband gaps, the relay should be placed closer to the cell edge. Furthermore, the optimal position of the relay is closer to the cell edge when the link budget of relay is much smaller than the eNodeB (eNB).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688738","startPage":"108","endPage":"113","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678911/6688738/06688749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay placement for inter-band carrier aggregation with asymmetrical coverage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6688749/","displayDocTitle":"Relay placement for inter-band carrier aggregation with asymmetrical coverage","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974457","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay placement for inter-band carrier aggregation with asymmetrical coverage","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p108mohamad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075332S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678911","isNumber":"6688738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678911","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6688738","articleId":"6688749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6688751,"authors":[{"name":"Ehab Mahmoud Mohamed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Aswan University, Aswan, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ehab Mahmoud","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37706929600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0156-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0155-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7843"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-7851"}],"articleNumber":"6688751","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"abstract":"MIMO-Constant Envelope Modulation, MIMO-CEM, with Low Resolution ADC receiver (1-bit ADC in the default operation) is considered as one of the alternative candidates to the well-known MIMO-OFDM, suitable for wireless backhaul networks. Because MIMO-CEM receiver is based upon low resolution ADC sampled at the Intermediate Frequency (IF) band, the currently used MIMO-CEM equalizer is too complicated. The equalizer high complexity comes from its design; in which IF based Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) is utilized. In order to efficiently estimate the transmitted sequence, the MLSE equalizer replicates the whole IF MIMO-CEM transceiver, which results in too complicated MIMO-CEM equalizer. In this paper, low complexity equalization technique for MIMO-CEM is proposed. In the proposed method, a baseband approximation model for the 1-bit ADC MIMO-CEM is investigated. Through using this model, a baseband based MIMO-CEM MLSE equalizer can be constructed. This baseband equalizer will nominate number of candidate sequences, which are further refined by the IF based MLSE equalizer to accurately estimate the transmitted sequence. Hence, the number of equalization processes required by the high complexity IF based MLSE are greatly reduced, which powerfully contributes in reducing the complexity of MIMO-CEM equalization. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is proven under different scenarios using Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) and Gaussian MSK (GMSK) modulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678911/6688738/06688751.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complexity efficient equalization technique for MIMO-constant envelope modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Equalizers","Baseband","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","MIMO","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","approximation theory","channel estimation","equalisers","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","MIMO communication","minimum shift keying","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-constant envelope modulation","low resolution ADC receiver","MIMO-OFDM","wireless backhaul network","MIMO-CEM receiver","intermediate frequency band","maximum likelihood sequence estimator","IF MIMO-CEM transceiver","low complexity equalization technique","baseband approximation model","MIMO-CEM MLSE equalizer","MIMO-CEM equalization","minimum shift keying modulation","Gaussian MSK","GMSK modulation","storage capacity 1 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Low resolution ADC","Constant envelope modulation","MLSE Equlaization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A complexity efficient equalization technique for MIMO-constant envelope modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974449","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complexity efficient equalization technique for MIMO-constant envelope modulation","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p114mohamed.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053877S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678911","isNumber":"6688738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678911","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6688738","articleId":"6688751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6688752,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Existing channel estimation usually addresses the scattered and continual pilot arrangement for DVB-T based OFDM systems. Pilot based channel estimator presented here differs from previous methods in a way that it is based on comb type pilot arrangement, which accurately estimates the MSE in the presence of COST 207 Typical Urban Reception (TU6) channel model.

(OFDM) combinations provide robust to multipath delay and high data rates in wireless communication. The wireless connection of fast moving platforms leads to high demands for the applied transmission scheme. Therefore, a channel estimation technique using fast time-varying channel is proposed in this paper. The time varying channel may destroy the orthogonality among the subcarrier resulting in Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). To cope with this problem, the ICI Self-cancellation (ICI-SC) technique is applied in a fast time varying channel using different types of diversity techniques such as space time block code (STBC), space frequency block code (SFBC) and space time-frequency block code (STFBC). Diversity techniques that exploit spatial time and frequency diversity can be designed using OFDM to reduce ICI as it is reliable in achieving maximum diversity. Thus, the objective of this paper is to evaluate BER performance using a Fast Time-Varying channel in MIMO-OFDM with ICI Self-Cancellation scheme using different diversity techniques. The simulation results show that using STFBC, the BER performance is the best compared to SFBC and STBC. In addition to that, ICI can be reduced and maximum diversity order with an efficient bandwidth can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688756","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678911/6688738/06688756.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast time-varying channels in MIMO-OFDM system using different diversity technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688756/","displayDocTitle":"Fast time-varying channels in MIMO-OFDM system using different diversity technique","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974468","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688756/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast time-varying channels in MIMO-OFDM system using different diversity technique","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p138idris.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055673S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678911","isNumber":"6688738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678911","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6688738","articleId":"6688756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6688814,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Shilian","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.

The resource limitation of mobile devices restricts mobile users for executing complex security operations using computational power of mobile devices. To make security schemes suitable for mobile devices, large volume of existing security schemes execute complex security operations remotely on cloud or trusted third party. Alternatively, few of the existing security schemes focus on the reduction of the computational complexity of the cryptographic algorithms. Keeping in view the resource limitation of mobile devices, this paper, introduces an incremental cryptographic version of the existing security schemes, such as encryption-based scheme, coding-based scheme, and sharing-based scheme, for improving the block(s) modification operations in term of resource utilization on mobile device. The experimental results show significant improvement in resource utilization on mobile device while performing block insertion, deletion, and modification operations as compared to the original version of the aforementioned schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678911/6688738/06688818.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of incremental cryptography for security schemes in mobile cloud computing environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Cloud computing","Message authentication","Mobile handsets","Encryption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","smart phones","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental cryptography","security schemes","mobile cloud computing environments","cloud storage services","resource constraint mobile device","mobile devices","trusted third party","computational complexity","cryptographic algorithms","encryption based scheme","coding based scheme","sharing based scheme","resource utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile cloud computing","security","privacy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A study of incremental cryptography for security schemes in mobile cloud computing environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974475","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of incremental cryptography for security schemes in mobile cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p62khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055181S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678911","isNumber":"6688738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678911","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6688738","articleId":"6688818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6688820,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The acclaimed SINR maximization (max-SINR) algorithm does not achieve fairness between user's streams, i.e., sub-stream fairness is not achieved. To this end, we propose a distributed power control algorithm to render sub-stream fairness in the system. Sub-stream fairness is a less restrictive design metric than stream fairness (i.e., fairness between all streams) thus sum-rate degradation is milder. Algorithmic parameters can significantly differentiate the results of numerical algorithms. A complete picture for comparison of algorithms can only be depicted by varying these parameters. For example, a predetermined iteration number or a negligible increment in the sum-rate can be the stopping criterion of an algorithm. While the distributed interference alignment (DIA) can reasonably achieve sub-stream fairness for the later, the imbalance between sub-streams increases as the preset iteration number decreases. Thus comparison of max-SINR and DIA with a low preset iteration number can only depict a part of the picture. We analyze such important parameters and their effects on SINR and rate metrics to exhibit numerical correctness in executing the benchmarks. Finally, we propose group filtering schemes that jointly design the streams of a user in contrast to max-SINR scheme that designs each stream of a user separately.","doi":"10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688824","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology & Applications (ISWTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678911/6688738/06688824.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWTA.2013.6688824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-stream fairness and numerical correctness in MIMO interference channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688824/","displayDocTitle":"Sub-stream fairness and numerical correctness in MIMO interference channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13974435","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688824/","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-stream fairness and numerical correctness in MIMO interference channels","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"p91yetis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103763S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678911","isNumber":"6688738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678911","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6688738","articleId":"6688824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6688849,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Falessi","affiliation":["Fraunhofer CESE, USA"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Falessi","id":"37395476600"},{"name":"Lucas Layman","affiliation":["Fraunhofer CESE, USA"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Layman","id":"37275748700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2552-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6688849","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural language processing","Software","NASA","Market research","Educational institutions","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","natural language processing","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NASA anomaly databases","natural language processing techniques","trending analysis","statistical analysis","anomaly data classification","National Aeronautics and Space Administration","software failure data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NLP","natural language processing","software failure"]}],"abstract":"NASA anomaly databases are rich resources of software failure data in the field.

Many approaches have been proposed in the literature. Most of them, however, do not consider even the basic attack prevention mechanisms that are activated by default on today's many operating systems. Examples of such mechanisms include Address Space Layout Randomization and Data Execution Prevention. With such security methods in place, attackers are forced to perform additional actions to circumvent them. In this research, we conjecture that some of these actions may require the use of additional system calls. If so, one can trace such attacks to discover attack patterns that can later be used to enhance the detection power of anomaly detection systems. The purpose of this short paper is to motivate the need to investigate the impact of attack on system calls while trying to overcome these prevention mechanisms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring system calls for anomaly detection in modern operating systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)","doi":"10.1109/ISSREW.2013.6688856","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops (ISSREW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679593/6688826/06688856.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2013.6688856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6688856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring system calls for anomaly detection in modern operating systems","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6688856/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13990656","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring system calls for anomaly detection in modern operating systems","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08914S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679593","isNumber":"6688826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679593","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6688826","articleId":"6688856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6688961,"authors":[{"name":"Lucian-Ovidiu Fedorovici","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Lucian-Ovidiu","lastName":"Fedorovici","id":"37569703400"},{"name":"Radu-Emil Precup","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Radu-Emil","lastName":"Precup","id":"37301187100"},{"name":"Florin Dragan","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Florin","lastName":"Dragan","id":"37565365000"},{"name":"Constantin Purcaru","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantin","lastName":"Purcaru","id":"37322096300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2228-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2227-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6688961","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":609},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6688961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neurons","Optical character recognition software","Vectors","Neural networks","Computational efficiency","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","convergence","evolutionary computation","minimisation","neural nets","optical character recognition","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary optimization-based convolutional neural network training","OCR applications","CNN training algorithms","optical character recognition applications","gravitational search algorithm algorithm","GSA algorithm","particle swarm optimization algorithm","PSO algorithm","backpropagation","performance improvements","local minima avoidance","convergence analysis","computational cost analysis","accuracy analysis","benchmark problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["back-propagation","convolutional neural netrorks","Gravitational Search Algorithms","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents aspects concerning the implementation of two training algorithms for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in optical character recognition (OCR) applications.

The ranks are assigned by progressively combining the search with decision. More precisely, the decision is implemented via an adaptive clustering which guides the search towards the middle of the Pareto-front. This enables a gradual rejection of the solutions expected to be less useful for the application. By monitoring the evolutions of the depicted clusters, the procedure is able to detect premature convergence and to intervene for encouraging the preservation of population diversity. In this attempt, whenever necessary, a supplementary objective is added. It is meant to directly control the variety of the most valuable genetic material.

These limitations are mainly due to the use of linear feedback architectures that do not consider constraints on the power amplifier dynamics during synthesis. Hence, to avoid any instability or inaccuracy due to nonlinearities of the power stage, the amplifier is generally operated with a highly conservative power budget. This paper investigates the applicability of reference governors and model predictive control in the field of precision power conversion. It is shown that the large signal behavior can be significantly improved, in terms of safety and accuracy. We also illustrate that dual-mode model predictive control (MPC), which combines a linear state-feedback with the sub-optimal solution of the MPC problem found by a real-time optimization solver, efficiently eliminates the small signal distortions inherently present in the standard real-time MPC implementation. The paper is organized as a case-study on controller synthesis for the opposed current converter, and as such, is well suited for practicing engineers in the field of precision power amplification.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6688927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTCC.2013.6689009","publicationTitle":"2013 17th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 17th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679340/6688927/06689009.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"515","doi":"10.1109/ICSTCC.2013.6689009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On real-time optimal control of high-precision switching amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On real-time optimal control of high-precision switching amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6689009/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13978393","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689009/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On real-time optimal control of high-precision switching amplifiers","confLoc":"Sinaia, Romania","sourcePdf":"086SpinuID061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08952S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679340","isNumber":"6688927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679340","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6688927","articleId":"6689009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6689010,"authors":[{"name":"Csaba Sz\u00e1sz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Machines and Drives, Technical University of Cluj, Cluj, Romania"],"firstName":"Csaba","lastName":"Sz\u00e1sz","id":"37369836700"},{"name":"Adrian Cioloca","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Technical University of Cluj, Cluj, Romania"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Cioloca","id":"37074840800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2228-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2227-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689010","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Hardware","Microprocessors","Grid computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","grid computing","parallel processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-layer coarse-fine-grid network model","bio-inspired computing systems development","high performance grid-computing systems development","field programmable gate array processor network","FPGA processors network-based grid-computing hardware system implementation","tissue-topology configuration","2D2L-CFG","grid-computing hardware system implementation","multicellular concept","task allocation","fault-tolerance problems","biological process","laboratory-prototype VLSI hardware platform","biological phenomena"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bio-inspired","FPGA network","coarse-fine-grid model","artificial cell","embryonic model"]}],"abstract":"In the last decade or so, biologically inspired techniques have gained a great acceptance as possible solutions for a wide range of challenges in high performance grid-computing systems development.

This bio-inspired computing platform has been conceived upon a tissue-topology configuration by introducing a novel two-dimensional on two-layer coarse-fine-grid network model (2D2L-CFG). By choosing a design strategy relying on a multi-cellular concept which outlines the versatility of biologically inspired technologies, task allocation, communication, or fault-tolerance problems are solved with high efficiency. Moreover, careful real-time simulations prove that by implementing methods that imitate biological processes, such architectures could be considered to be \u201cintelligent\u201d because of their capability to adapting in response to changes of their surrounding environment. The benefits of this approach are also confirmed by experiments performed on a laboratory-prototype VLSI hardware platform.

Using beamforming techniques at the receiver together with novel radar processing techniques, the range, Doppler, and azimuth information for an arbitrary number of objects (relative to the number of antenna elements used in the antenna array) can be estimated through a simultaneous transmission.","publicationTitle":"2013 European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679725/6689067/06689134.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2D radar imaging with velocity estimation using a MIMO OFDM-based radar for automotive applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689134/","displayDocTitle":"2D radar imaging with velocity estimation using a MIMO OFDM-based radar for automotive applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13990718","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689134/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D radar imaging with velocity estimation using a MIMO OFDM-based radar for automotive applications","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056963S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679725","isNumber":"6689067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6689067","articleId":"6689134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6689150,"authors":[{"name":"Reinhard Feger","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Feger","id":"37304277500"},{"name":"Herman Jalli Ng","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Herman Jalli","lastName":"Ng","id":"37085862277"},{"name":"Clemens Pfeffer","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Pfeffer","id":"37847520300"},{"name":"Andreas Stelzer","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Integrated Radar Sensors, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Stelzer","id":"37277223300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-033-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689150","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Frequency modulation","Noise","Binary phase shift keying","Radar antennas","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","delta-sigma modulation","FM radar","phase shift keying","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma transmitter","heterodyne FMCW radar","frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar","binary phase-shift keying modulator","delta-sigma modulator","noise shaping","signal processing technique","signal-to-noise ratio","bandwidth 3 GHz"]}],"abstract":"We present a heterodyne frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system operating in W-band with a bandwidth of 3 GHz. The architecture is based on a binary phase-shift keying modulator in combination with a delta-sigma modulator. These components are used in the transmit (TX) path of the radar. In this way the frequency of the TX signal can be shifted arbitrarily, which allows to freely choose the center frequency of the radar output signal. This offers several advantages, especially for short-range applications. Compared to a conventional FMCW radar the complexity of the novel system is only slightly increased due to the added components. Measurements, carried out using a transceiver together with antennas in package, demonstrate that the noise shaping together with a suitable signal processing technique leads to a signal-to-noise ratio which is only 4 dB below a purely homodyne system for moderate target distances. However, considering very closely spaced targets it is shown that the heterodyne radar even outperforms its homodyne counterpart.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A delta-sigma transmitter based heterodyne FMCW radar","publicationTitle":"2013 European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679725/6689067/06689150.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689067","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A delta-sigma transmitter based heterodyne FMCW radar","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689150/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13996670","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A delta-sigma transmitter based heterodyne FMCW radar","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1700.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080005S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679725","isNumber":"6689067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6689067","articleId":"6689150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EMA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6689151,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Lutz","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Engineering and Mechatronics, University of Applied Sciences Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Lutz","id":"37533264600"},{"name":"Thomas Walter","affiliation":["Institute of Medical Engineering and Mechatronics, University of Applied Sciences Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Walter","id":"38506436900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-033-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689151","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1366},"abstract":"The demanding tasks for automotive radar systems in multi target scenarios require an increased target separation performance and new sensor concepts.

If orthogonally arranged transmit and receive arrays are used instead, the angular resolution equals that of a radar system using only a single antenna on the transmit and a full antenna array on the receiver side or vice-versa. This paper evaluates the influence of different antenna array configurations on the angular resolution capability by means of a 24GHz Digital Beamforming radar system. Besides the so-called inverted T-shaped antenna arrangement, various array geometries are discussed. Compared to the full planar antenna array the introduced geometries provide better angular resolution, while allowing for a highly reduced number of antennas, saving space and cost. Each presented antenna array is realized in hardware and the angular resolution capability is evaluated by means of a 24 GHz Digital Beamforming radar system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D antenna array geometries for MIMO radar imaging by Digital Beamforming","publicationTitle":"2013 European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6679725/6689067/06689194.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689067","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689194","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"2-D antenna array geometries for MIMO radar imaging by Digital Beamforming","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689194/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13990771","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D antenna array geometries for MIMO radar imaging by Digital Beamforming","confLoc":"Nuremberg, Germany","sourcePdf":"1546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056074S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6679725","isNumber":"6689067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6679725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6689067","articleId":"6689194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EMA","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6689258,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew A.

Each tag represents a unique ID in the backscattered signal. Here, the data are embedded on the tag as the complex natural resonances (CNRs) of the structure. In the cases where more than one tag exist in the main beam of the reader antenna, the frequency-domain response is not sufficient to successfully distinguish the IDs of the tags. By applying the STMPM technique to the time-domain response, the poles and their residues are obtained at each snapshot of time. In order to obtain the exact values of the turn-on times of the poles, which are the roundtrip time of the tags to the antenna, high resolution in the time domain is needed which deteriorates the resolution in the frequency domain. Using mathematical descriptions, a simple formulation is derived which exhibits a duality between late-time response in the time domain and early-time response in the frequency domain. Therefore, a space-frequency representation can be simply obtained from the application of the short-frequency matrix pencil method (SFMPM) to the frequency-domain response of the tags. By possessing the exact values of the turn-on times and pole/residues of the tags, their backscattered responses can be reconstructed and associated IDs can be retrieved. With the proposed method in this paper, some scenarios are studied and discussed. As an experimental result, three 3-bit tags with different IDs (ID\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n:101, ID\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n:111, and ID\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n:011) are fabricated and placed away from each other. Exploiting the presented technique, the IDs of the tags and their locations are successfully distinguished. The simulation results are validated by the measured ones.

All the networked systems can have different dynamics and all the dynamics are unknown. A neural network (NN) with flexible structure is used to approximate the unknown dynamics at each node. Considering that the leader is a neighbor of only a subset of the followers and the followers have only local interactions, we introduce a cooperative dynamic observer at each node to overcome the deficiency of the traditional tracking control strategies. An observer-based cooperative controller design framework is proposed with the aid of graph tools, Lyapunov-based design method, self-structuring NN, and separation principle. It is proved that each agent can follow the active leader only if the communication graph contains a spanning tree.

It is well known that power electronics respond more quickly where the inverter initially picks up the majority of every load step, and the generator's output slowly increases until they reach their steady-state load sharing given by droop settings. This excessive transient power output from the inverter constrains its rating relative to the largest load step and could negatively impact the battery life in battery energy-storage inverters. This article provides a detailed examination of the differences between the frequency-regulation characteristics of inverters and generators to explain, in a novel way, the cause of the poor transient power sharing. The tradeoff between an improved transient load sharing and increased voltage and frequency transients is highlighted, and it is demonstrated that equal transient load sharing can be achieved by emulating an SG using a power hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) approach. Validation is provided by simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/MIAS.2013.2288408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIAS.2013.2288408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/2943/6734703/06689318.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sharing Transient Loads : Causes of Unequal Transient Load Sharing in Islanded Microgrid Operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sharing Transient Loads : Causes of Unequal Transient Load Sharing in Islanded Microgrid Operation","volume":"20","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689318/","publicationDate":"March-April 2014","accessionNumber":"14079282","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689318/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sharing Transient Loads : Causes of Unequal Transient Load Sharing in Islanded Microgrid Operation","sourcePdf":"20mias02-paquette-2288408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098482S","chronDate":"March-April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"2943","isNumber":"6734703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6734703","articleId":"6689318","onlineDate":"19 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6689323,"authors":[{"name":"Qimei Cui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6851966/6689323/cui-2295413-small.gif","p":["\nQimei Cui (M'11) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electronic\nengineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in\ntelecommunications from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2006.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the BUPT.

In this paper, we investigate the energy efficiency of three basic bidirectional relay transmission schemes [i.e., the four time-slot (4TS), three time-slot (3TS), and two time-slot (2TS) schemes] from the angle of relay deployment. Since a realistic power consumption model is very important in analyzing energy efficiency, and a power amplifier (PA) consumes up to 70% of the total power, we consider a realistic nonideal PA model. The derived closed-form expressions for the optimal relay deployment and the simulation results reveal the following important conclusions. First, it is possible to achieve the optimal energy efficiency and enlarge the cell coverage simultaneously in bad channel conditions, but it may be very challenging in good channel conditions. Second, under asymmetric traffic conditions, particularly when the downlink rate is larger than the uplink rate, all the aforementioned three schemes have almost the same optimal relay deployment, but the 2TS scheme has the highest energy efficiency when the spectral efficiency is large. Third, the relay node should be deployed closer to the base station with the nonideal PA than that with the ideal PA, and the optimal energy efficiency with the nonideal PA is much higher than that with the ideal PA. Moreover, the impact of small-scale fading depends on the value of path loss. To overcome the small-scale fading, the relay network needs to consume more energy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6851966/06689323.pdf","startPage":"2625","endPage":"2641","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2295413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2295413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6851966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689323","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Energy-Efficient Relay Deployment for the Bidirectional Relay Transmission Schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power demand","Energy consumption","Downlink","Licenses","Uplink","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","power amplifiers","radio networks","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient relay network deployment","wireless communication","bidirectional relay transmission scheme","power consumption model","ideal power amplifier","nonideal PA model","closed form expression","asymmetric traffic","downlink rate","uplink rate","2TS scheme","two time-slot scheme","spectral efficiency","relay node","base station","fading channel","three time-slot scheme","3TS scheme","four time-slot scheme","4TS scheme"]},{"kwd":["Bidirectional relay transmissions","energy efficiency","network coding","non-ideal power amplifier","relay deployment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Energy-Efficient Relay Deployment for the Bidirectional Relay Transmission Schemes","volume":"63","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6689323/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14432050","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"xx2012037"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET12-0795"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project","grantNumber":"YETP0429"},{"fundingName":"Key National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61231009"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2012ZX03001039-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimal Energy-Efficient Relay Deployment for the Bidirectional Relay Transmission Schemes","sourcePdf":"tvt-cui-2295413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202024S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6851966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6851966","articleId":"6689323","onlineDate":"19 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6689324,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6730969/6689324/6689324-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Song (S\u201909) received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2009.

Although some scanners consist of internal position sensors, the sensitivity is not high enough to monitor high-resolution nanomanipulations. Additionally, once the scan size decreases to a nanolevel such as less than 100 nm, the noise brought by sensors is large enough to affect the performance of the closed-loop motion control system. In this paper, a non-vector space control strategy based on compressive feedback is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of SPM-based nanomanipulations. In this approach, local images (or compressive data) are used as both the reference input and feedback for a non-vector space closed-loop controller which considers the local image (or compressive data) as a set. The controller is designed in non-vector space, and it requires no prior information on features or landmarks which are widely used in traditional visual servoing. In this paper, the atomic force microscopy is used as an example of SPM to implement the non-vector space control strategy for nanomanipulations. The motivation of designing such a non-vector space controller is to solve the accuracy problem in nanomanipulation. Without this technique, the SPM-based nanomanipulations, such as nanomeasurement and nanosurgery, are difficult to conduct, with accuracy controlled under several nanometers. In order to illustrate the contributions and potential applications of this non-vector controller, at the end of this paper, an application of carbon nanotube local electrical property characterization based on a non-vector space motion control is shown to clearly verify the concept. Compared with other research in the local electrical property characterization, the non-vector space controller can ensure that the measurement accuracy (position error) is controlled within a few nanometers, which also ensures the reliability of measurement results. Additionally, this non-vector space control method can be implemented into any kind of SPM to realize a real-time control for nanomanipulation such as nanofabrication and nanoassembly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Feedback-Based Motion Control for Nanomanipulation\u2014Theory and Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2013.2291619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/6730969/06689324.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2013.2291619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6730969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Feedback-Based Motion Control for Nanomanipulation\u2014Theory and Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6689324/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078381","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Feedback-Based Motion Control for Nanomanipulation\u2014Theory and Applications","sourcePdf":"tro-song-2291619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098659S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6730969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6730969","articleId":"6689324","onlineDate":"19 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6689326,"authors":[{"name":"Prakash Kumar Rout","affiliation":["Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/6729094/6689326/6689326-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Prakash Kumar Rout (M'13) received the M.Tech degree in communication system engineering from Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, India, in 2008.

A recently developed multiobjective optimization technique infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm is used to minimize the power and the phase noise of the circuit at its schematic and physical level. The multiobjective optimization is carried out by taking into account the extracted parasitics that would be present in the physical integrated circuit and the random variations of parameters during fabrication in foundry. This method helps the designer in semiconductor industry by effectively reducing several time consuming design iterations to a single iteration ensuring the near optimal performance of the CSVCO. The performance of the circuit is validated by carrying out simulations for transient and noise analysis in Cadence tools using 90 nm 1P9M CMOS process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078899","htmlLink":"/document/6689326/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multiobjective Optimization Based Fast and Robust Design Methodology for Low Power and Low Phase Noise Current Starved VCO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiobjective Optimization Based Fast and Robust Design Methodology for Low Power and Low Phase Noise Current Starved VCO","sourcePdf":"tsm-rout-2295423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073312S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"6729094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6729094","articleId":"6689326","onlineDate":"19 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6689331,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Fock","affiliation":["University of La Reunion, Le Tampon, R\u00e9union"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6855384/6689331/fock-2294437-small.gif","p":["Eric Fock (M'05) received the bachelor's degree in physics and the M.Sc. degree in electronics from the University of Paris VII, Paris, France, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanics from the University of La R\u00e9union, R\u00e9union, France.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Faculty of Human and Environmental Sciences and with the Research Unit PIMENT, University of La R\u00e9union, which is an Outermost Region of Europe and a French Overseas Department in Indian Ocean.

letter presents a broadband saturated power amplifier (PA) using the harmonic control circuits for base station application. The saturated PA has advantages for broadband operation with high efficiency due to the large tolerance of the second harmonic tuning. However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve the fundamental and second harmonic impedance matching across a wide bandwidth. To solve the problem, the harmonic control circuits are placed at the input and output of the device's die. These harmonic control circuits play a role of leading the second harmonic impedances to the optimum regions but are specially designed to be insensitive to the following fundamental matching circuit. The saturated PA with the harmonic control circuit is designed using a 120 W GaN device, achieving a high efficiency and wide bandwidth characteristics simultaneously. The measured output power, drain efficiency, and gain are at least 51.0 dBm, 71.0%, and 8.22 dB at the saturation across the 1.75 to 2.17 GHz (21% relative bandwidth) under pulse test (10% duty). This saturated PA also delivers good performances for long term evolution (LTE) and wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) modulated signals at 1.85 and 2.14 GHz, respectively. These results show that the broadband saturated PA with the harmonic control circuit is suitable to wide bandwidth multimode/multiband applications.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2013.2292925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2013.2292925","startPage":"185","endPage":"187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/6759771/06689349.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Saturated Power Amplifier With Harmonic Control Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Saturated Power Amplifier With Harmonic Control Circuits","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2014","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689349/","accessionNumber":"14145748","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689349/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Saturated Power Amplifier With Harmonic Control Circuits","sourcePdf":"lmwc-son-2292925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052238S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"6759771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6759771","articleId":"6689349","onlineDate":"19 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6689353,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00fcner D. \u00c7elik","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Cambridge, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7041254/6689353/6689353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["G\u00fcner D.\u00c7elik (S'06\u2013M'12) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, with second highest ranking in 2005, and the S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2007 and 2012, respectively, under the supervision of Prof. Eytan Modiano.","In 2010, he was a Visiting Researcher with the Mathematics of Networks and Complex Systems Research Group, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, USA, and in 2007, he joined the Microsoft Research (MSR) Systems and Networking Group, Cambridge, U.K., as a Research Intern.

We show that the simultaneous presence of time-varying channels and reconfiguration delays significantly reduces the system stability region and changes the structure of optimal policies. We first consider memoryless channel processes and characterize the stability region in closed form. We prove that a frame-based Max-Weight scheduling algorithm that sets frame durations dynamically, as a function of the current queue lengths and average channel gains, is throughput-optimal. Next, we consider arbitrary Markov-modulated channel processes and show that memory in the channel processes can be exploited to improve the stability region. We develop a novel approach to characterizing the stability region of such systems using state-action frequencies, which are stationary solutions to a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation. Moreover, we develop a dynamic control policy using the state-action frequencies and variable frames whose lengths are functions of queue sizes and show that it is throughput-optimal. The frame-based dynamic control (FBDC) policy is applicable to a broad class of network control systems, with or without reconfiguration delays, and provides a new framework for developing throughput-optimal network control policies using state-action frequencies. Finally, we propose Myopic policies that are easy to implement and have better delay properties as compared to the FBDC policy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14930736","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6689353/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Scheduling in Networks With Time-Varying Channels and Reconfiguration Delay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling in Networks With Time-Varying Channels and Reconfiguration Delay","sourcePdf":"tnet-celik-2292604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180588S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7041254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7041254","articleId":"6689353","onlineDate":"19 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6689356,"authors":[{"name":"Niusha Sarkhosh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Niusha Sarkhosh (S'06\u2013M'10), photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Niusha","lastName":"Sarkhosh","id":"37547061900"},{"name":"Hossein Emami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Hossein Emami (M'11), photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Emami","id":"37547062600"},{"name":"Mohsen Ashourian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Isfahan, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Mohsen Ashourian (S'98\u2013M'01\u2013SM'13), photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Ashourian","id":"37085399188"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"6689356","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":533},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Phase shift keying","Bandwidth","Radio frequency","OFDM","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic warfare","electro-optical modulation","microwave photonics","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase-shift keying","RF photonic QPSK modulator","broadband Hilbert transformer","carrier frequency independent operation","electronic warfare transmitters","frequency hopping","frequency 9.8 GHz to 30.2 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave optical design","microwave photonics (MWP)","optical fibers","photonics","ultra-wideband (UWB) communications"]}],"abstract":"An RF photonic quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulator is conceived and demonstrated practically.

As a result of this increased flow granularity, static routing cannot efficiently load-balance traffic, resulting in an increased network contention and a reduced throughput. Unfortunately, while adaptive routing can solve this load-balancing problem, DCN designers refrain from using it, because it also creates out-of-order packet delivery that can significantly degrade the reliable transport performance of the longer flows. In this paper, we show that by throttling each flow bandwidth to half of the network link capacity, a distributed adaptive routing algorithm is able to converge to a non-blocking routing assignment within a few iterations, causing minimal out-of-order packet delivery. We present a Markov chain model for distributed adaptive routing in the context of Clos networks that provides an approximation for the expected convergence time. This model predicts that for full-link-bandwidth traffic, the convergence time is exponential with the network size, so out-of-order packet delivery is unavoidable for long messages. However, with half-rate traffic, the algorithm converges within a few iterations and exhibits weak dependency on the network size. Therefore, we show that distributed adaptive routing may be used to provide scalable and non-blocking routing even for long flows in a rearrangeably-non-blocking Clos network under half-rate conditions. The proposed model is evaluated and approximately fits the abstract system simulation model. Hardware implementation guidelines are provided and evaluated using a detailed flit-level InfiniBand simulation model. These results, providing fast convergence to non-blocking routing assignment, directly apply to adaptive-routing systems designed and deployed in various DCNs.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"88","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689238","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6689238/06689486.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Adaptation models","Convergence","Bandwidth","Adaptive systems","Markov processes","Ports (Computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","computer networks","Markov processes","multistage interconnection networks","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["InfiniBand simulation model","nonblocking Clos network","nonblocking routing","scalable routing","Markov chain model","distributed adaptive routing algorithm","flow bandwidth throttling","flow granularity","data center network","nonblocking DCN routing assignments","distributed adaptive routing convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Center Networks","Big Data","Adaptive Routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Adaptive Routing Convergence to Non-Blocking DCN Routing Assignments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689486/","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6689486/","accessionNumber":"13996592","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Adaptive Routing Convergence to Non-Blocking DCN Routing Assignments","sourcePdf":"088jsac0114zahavi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090775S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6689238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6689238","articleId":"6689486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6689487,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyang Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6689238/6689487/6689487-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiyang Guo received B.Eng degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008.

Meanwhile, most data center networks (DCNs) today adopt a multi-rooted tree structure called fat-tree, which utilizes rich path multiplicity to deliver high bisection bandwidth. However, without an efficient flow scheduling algorithm that appropriately routes multicast flows to achieve traffic load balance, heavy congestion may occur throughout the network, which prevents full utilization of such high degree of link parallelism and causes unpredictable network performance. Hence, in this paper we study multicast flow scheduling in fat-tree DCNs, where multicast flow requests arrive one by one without a priori knowledge of future traffic. To address the drastic traffic fluctuation in data centers, we consider a very general traffic model called hose traffic model, where the only assumption is that the total bandwidth demand of traffic that enters (leaves) an ingress (egress) link of each server at any time is bounded by the capacity of its network interface card. We present a low-complexity on-line multicast flow scheduling algorithm for fat-tree DCNs. The algorithm can achieve bounded congestion and efficient bandwidth utilization under any arbitrary sequence of multicast flow requests that satisfy the hose model. We also derive the bound on congestion that the algorithm can achieve in a fat-tree DCN. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm by an event-driven DCN simulator under various types of traffic patterns, and show that the algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of network throughput and evenness of traffic load distribution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6689238/06689487.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689238","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Multicast Scheduling with Bounded Congestion in Fat-Tree Data Center Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Servers","Hoses","Scheduling algorithms","Prediction algorithms","Ports (Computers)","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","computer networks","multicast communication","scheduling","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fat-tree data center networks","on-line multicast scheduling","bounded congestion","multirooted tree structure","rich path multiplicity","bisection bandwidth","flow scheduling","multicast flow routing","traffic load balance","heavy congestion","traffic fluctuation","hose traffic model","network interface card","event-driven DCN simulator","network throughput","traffic load distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data center networks","multicast","predictability","fat-tree","congestion","hose model","load balance","on-line","flow scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Multicast Scheduling with Bounded Congestion in Fat-Tree Data Center Networks","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6689487/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"13990282","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Multicast Scheduling with Bounded Congestion in Fat-Tree Data Center Networks","sourcePdf":"102jsac0114guo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072043S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6689238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6689238","articleId":"6689487","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6689488,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Kang Jia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6689238/6689488/6689488-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Kang Jia (S'09-M'11) received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011.

This scheme, called Code-Oriented eXplicit multicast (COXcast), is based on unicast and eXplicit multicast (Xcast). It constructs the unicast path and multicast tree by encoding the corresponding output port bitmap of each intermediate node. Using a common identifier and a node-specific key, so packets can be self-routed to multiple receivers without requiring header modification. In addition, intermediate switches/routers on the path/tree can be stateless. Compared to traditional source-based unicasting and explicit-based multicasting schemes, COXcast has lowered the processing cost, protocol overhead and delivery latency, while simplifying the deployment and management of a large number of medium-scale multicast groups, especially when applied to large-scale DCNs.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6689238/06689488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689238","startPage":"116","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Multicast Source Routing Architecture for Data Center Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Multicast Source Routing Architecture for Data Center Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"13990283","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6689488/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Multicast Source Routing Architecture for Data Center Networks","sourcePdf":"116jsac0114jia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067666S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6689238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6689238","articleId":"6689488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6689509,"authors":[{"name":"Junfei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6880447/6689509/6689509-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junfei Xie (S'13) received the B.S. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China in 2012, and the M.S. degree from University of North Texas, Denton, Texas in 2013.

This is due to their capability to approximate the nonlinear system in several locally linear subsystems. Many clustering algorithms exist in literature allowing the identification of the parameters intervening in the TS fuzzy model. In this paper a new clustering algorithm noted NEPCM-PSO is proposed. The proposed algorithm represents a combination between New Extended Possibilistic C-Means algorithm (NEPCM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The effectiveness of this algorithm is tested on a nonlinear system and on an electro-hydraulic system.

It is become the default choice for security services in numerous applications. Fault injection attacks are powerful cryptanalysis techniques against the AES algorithm. These attacks are based on injecting faults into the structure of the AES to obtain the confidential information. To protect the AES implementation against these attacks, a number of countermeasures have been proposed. In this paper, we present the implementation details of the AES 128-bit encryption and decryption. We conduct a fault injection attack against the unprotected AES. Moreover we proposed a fault detection scheme for the AES. The simulation results show that the fault coverage achieves 99.998%. The protected AES has been implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. Its fault coverage, area overhead, frequency degradation and throughput have been compared and it is shown that the proposed fault detection scheme allows a trade-off between the ability to detect faults and the implementation cost of the AES.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA implementation of the AES with fault detection countermeasure","doi":"10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689555","startPage":"264","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689499","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678896/6689499/06689555.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA implementation of the AES with fault detection countermeasure","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689555/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13999076","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA implementation of the AES with fault detection countermeasure","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"paper055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065472S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678896","isNumber":"6689499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6689499","articleId":"6689555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-25"},{"_id":6689568,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Each load has to be transported by one of the vehicles, between pickup and delivery customers. We are assuming that all vehicles have the same capacity and each one start and finish route at the same depot.

One of the major driving forces of Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA) is the chemotactic movement of a virtual bacterium that models a trial solution of the optimization problem. However, during the process of chemotaxis, the BFOA depends on random search directions which may lead to delay in reaching the global solution. This paper comes up with a hybrid approach involving Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and BFOA algorithm called Bacterial Swarm Optimization (BSO) for designing Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) in a power system. In BSO, the search directions of tumble behaviour for each bacterium are oriented by the individual's best location and the global best location of PSO. The proposed hybrid algorithm has been extensively compared with BFOA and PSO. Simulation results have shown the validity of the proposed BSO in tuning SSSC compared with BFOA and PSO. Moreover, the results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller to improve the power system stability over a wide range of loading conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Damping","Voltage control","Microorganisms","Optimization","Regulators","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

image denoising with pulse mode operations and hybrid on-chip learning algorithm","abstract":"This paper proposes a pulse mode neural network (PMNN) based image denoising operation. Known by their outstanding future, PMNN is gaining support in the field of hardware implementation thanks to its significant compactness and higher density of integration. However, early pulse mode implementation suffers from some constraints due to the complexity of the on-chip learning ability, since the back-propagation algorithm is probably the most used, which costs much of hardware resources. To overcome this limitation and to provide an effective hardware implementation, we propose in this paper a hybrid learning algorithm, in which, we apply the K-means algorithm to adjust the centers positions of the basic activation functions, as well as the back-propagation algorithm to update the connection weights. The corresponding design was implemented into the FPGA platform. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we consider image denoising which is a very needed step in image processing. Experimental results show good learning ability and effective generalization test.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689632/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13998952","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689632/","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network based image denoising with pulse mode operations and hybrid on-chip learning algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based image denoising with pulse mode operations and hybrid on-chip learning algorithm","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"paper132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123203S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678896","isNumber":"6689499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678896","xplore-issue":"6689499","articleId":"6689632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6689633,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Mahmoud Ismail","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mohamed Mahmoud","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37290452600"},{"name":"M.

The proposed estimator will be applied on Nickel-Cadmium battery model to test the validity of SOC neural network estimator to estimate the state of charge. Also, to know how the proposed estimator will be able to adapt with a new battery behavior such as capacity loss, the estimator will be tested in the case of a loss in capacity for the same Nickel-Cadmium battery model.

In most modern systems the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is a controller that senses the generator output voltage (and sometimes the current) then initiates corrective action by changing the exciter control in the desired direction. The speed of the automatic voltage regulator is of great interest in studying stability. Because of the high inductance in the generator field winding, it is difficult to make rapid changes in field current. This introduces a considerable lag in the control function and is one of the major obstacles to be overcome in designing a regulating system.","doi":"10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689655","startPage":"857","endPage":"863","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689499","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678896/6689499/06689655.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi objective genetic algorithm controller's tuning for non-linear automatic voltage regulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689655/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi objective genetic algorithm controller's tuning for non-linear automatic voltage regulator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13999062","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi objective genetic algorithm controller's tuning for non-linear automatic voltage regulator","confLoc":"Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"paper155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066975S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6678896","isNumber":"6689499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6678896","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6689499","articleId":"6689655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6689665,"authors":[{"name":"Amel Adouni","affiliation":["Electrical department, National Engineering School of Gabes Photovoltaic, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Adouni","id":"37085501286"},{"name":"Mouna Ben Hamed","affiliation":["Electrical department, National Engineering School of Gabes Photovoltaic, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mouna","lastName":"Ben Hamed","id":"37085422047"},{"name":"Aymen Flah","affiliation":["Electrical department, National Engineering School of Gabes Photovoltaic, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Aymen","lastName":"Flah","id":"37086194031"},{"name":"Lassaad Sbita","affiliation":["Electrical department, National Engineering School of Gabes Photovoltaic, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Lassaad","lastName":"Sbita","id":"37697858900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5549-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5547-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689665","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689665","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Circuit faults","Actuators","Induction motors","Fuzzy logic","Inverters","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","fuzzy logic","induction motors","neural nets","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor fault","Matlab/Simulink software","artificial intelligent techniques","induction machine","induction motor","fuzzy logic","artificial neural networks","fault isolation","actuator fault detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689665","pdfPath":"/iel7/6678896/6689499/06689665.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","startPage":"917","endPage":"922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2013.6689665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor and actuator fault detection and isolation based on artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic applicated on induction motor","abstract":"This paper presents a scheme for fault detection and isolation (FDI).

A major challenge in designing such an application is how to deal with content delivery among heterogeneous clients. Especially, with the development of the mobile internet and smart phones, how to provide an effective multi-source heterogeneous P2P IPTV solution becomes of great importance. Due to the special requirement of supporting differentiated multiple video streaming for different users, already existing P2P live video streaming techniques are inappropriate to be adopted directly. Therefore, this paper proposes a source-aware mobile P2P IPTV solution (SAMP) to provide multi-source live streaming for heterogeneous clients. In detail, SAMP includes a source-aware P2P topology construction algorithm to deduce the bandwidth occupation and the control overhead among the P2P clients, and contains a source-aware P2P streaming scheduling algorithm to further enhance the delay performance of the P2P IPTV system. The evaluation results show that the proposed SAMP scheme can provide a differentiated multi-source live streaming for heterogeneous clients with reduced bandwidth consumption, control overhead, and delivery delay.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2013.6689688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2013.6689688","startPage":"772","endPage":"778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/6689678/06689688.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAMP: supporting multi-source heterogeneity in mobile P2P IPTV system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2013","displayDocTitle":"SAMP: supporting multi-source heterogeneity in mobile P2P IPTV system","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689688/","accessionNumber":"13990169","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689688/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAMP: supporting multi-source heterogeneity in mobile P2P IPTV system","sourcePdf":"p772-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060444S","chronDate":"November  2013","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6689678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6689678","articleId":"6689688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6689689,"authors":[{"name":"Mingwei Lin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6689678/6689689/6689689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingwei Lin received his B.S. degree in Software Engineering from Chongqing University, China, in July 2009.

EPRA assigns a weighted value to each victim page candidate and selects a victim page candidate that has the least weighted value as a victim page. The elapsed time of each dirty flash page since the most recent reference is used to classify the dirty flash pages within the dirty victim page into the hot dirty flash pages and cold ones. When a dirty victim page is selected, EPRA only writes the dirty flash pages within the victim page back to NAND flash memory by separating the hot dirty flash pages from the cold ones and writing them to different free blocks within the NAND flash memory.

However, each SCRAM memory cell has a limited lifetime. To use SCRAM to replace power-hungry DRAM in mobile consumer devices, wear-leveling among cells will be a critical issue. Especially, due to the locality of memory access pattern, current operating systems. SCRAM-unaware memory allocator may intensify the wear of certain SCRAM blocks. Wear-leveling requires the redesign of operating systems to distribute memory accesses evenly throughout the entire memory space. This paper suggests two operating-system-level wear-leveling techniques for SCRAM devices. First, this paper proposes a novel memory allocator, called W-Buddy, that considers the wear of memory chunks as it selects a free memory chunk to be allocated. Second, this paper proposes a variable metadata formatting technique for file systems. The experiment results show that the proposed W-Buddy allocator and metadata reformatting technique improve the lifetime of SCRAM devices compared with the techniques of conventional operating systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Phase change random access memory","File systems","Resource management","Operating systems","Flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","meta data","random-access storage","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wear wear-out-aware memory management","WAM","storage class RAM devices","SCRAM devices","low power mobile systems","power-efficient memory cell","byte-addressable memory cell","nonvolatile memory cell","mobile consumer devices","memory access pattern","current operating systems","SCRAM-unaware memory allocator","SCRAM blocks","wear-leveling techniques","W-Buddy","memory chunks","variable metadata formatting technique","file systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689692","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2013.6689692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/6689678/06689692.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2013.6689692","startPage":"803","endPage":"810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WAM: Wear wear-out-aware memory management for SCRAM-based low power mobile systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WAM: Wear wear-out-aware memory management for SCRAM-based low power mobile systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689692/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2013","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6689692/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","publicationDate":"November 2013","accessionNumber":"13990160","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WAM: Wear wear-out-aware memory management for SCRAM-based low power mobile systems","sourcePdf":"p803-seo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039159S","chronDate":"November  2013","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6689678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6689678","articleId":"6689692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6689693,"authors":[{"name":"Debiao He","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6689678/6689693/6689693-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Debiao He received his Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University in 2009.

Single core processors have reached their limit and multicore processors are there to overcome this issue to give more processing power. In order to accelerate the implementation of new video coding standards, MPEG has standardized an alternative framework to describe video decoders. It is based on reference decoders written in the RVC CAL dataflow actor language. From these descriptions, a compiler - Open RVC CAL compiler (Orcc) - allows the automatic generation of C code dedicated to the target processor. In this paper, a DSP based decoder compliant with the new High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard has been implemented using a CAL RVC model as a starting point. This is the first implementation of an HEVC decoder with DSP technology based on a HEVC RVC CAL model. The decoder has been compared in performance with a GPP implementation, also based on the RVC CAL model, and outperforms it by more than 50%. Additionally, the performance of this decoder is compared with that of other DSP-based HEVC decoders implemented without using the Orcc infrastructure\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689697/","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6689697/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13990155","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A DSP-Based HEVC decoder implementation using an actor language dataflow model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSP-Based HEVC decoder implementation using an actor language dataflow model","sourcePdf":"p839-chavarrias.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102134S","chronDate":"November  2013","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6689678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6689678","articleId":"6689697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6689700,"authors":[{"name":"Eunjung Chae","affiliation":["Department of Image, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6689678/6689700/6689700-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eunjung Chae (S'12) was born in Seoul, Korea in 1988.

The proposed antialiasing algorithm detects aliasing artifacts by analyzing the frequency characteristics of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, and then removes the aliasing artifacts by shrinking the transform coefficients in the directionally adaptive manner. More specifically, the proposed algorithm analyzes the property of LH, HL, and HH subbands of the DWT, and reduces aliasing artifacts in the LL subband by shrinking the coefficients in the patch-based adaptive manner. On the other hand, aliasing artifacts in LH, HL, and HH subbands are reduced using a directional filtering. The resulting anti-aliased image is obtained by taking the inverse DWT. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce the aliasing artifacts while preserving the high-frequency image details. The proposed anti-aliasing algorithm is suitable for not only mobile imaging systems but also various application areas of image restoration and multidimensional sampling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatially adaptive antialiasing for enhancement of mobile imaging system using combined wavelet-fourier transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2013.6689700","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/6689678/06689700.pdf","startPage":"862","endPage":"868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2013.6689700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689678","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689700/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2013","displayDocTitle":"Spatially adaptive antialiasing for enhancement of mobile imaging system using combined wavelet-fourier transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6689700/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","publicationDate":"November 2013","accessionNumber":"13990159","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially adaptive antialiasing for enhancement of mobile imaging system using combined wavelet-fourier transform","sourcePdf":"p862-chae.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096906S","chronDate":"November  2013","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6689678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6689678","articleId":"6689700","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6689774,"authors":[{"name":"Andre Bezanson","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6689765/6689774/6689774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andre Bezanson received his B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from Dalhousie University in 2010.

To achieve a miniaturized form factor, a novel technique of wire bonding the array elements to a polyimide flexible circuit board oriented parallel to the forwardlooking ultrasound beam and perpendicular to the array was developed. A technique of partially dicing into the back of the array was also implemented to improve the directivity of the array elements. The array was fabricated with a single-layer P(VDF-TrFE)-copolymer matching layer and a polymethylpentene (TPX) lens for passive elevation focusing to a depth of 7 mm. The two-way-6-dB pulse bandwidth was measured to be 55% and the average electromechanical coupling (keff) for the individual elements was measured to be 0.62. The one-way -6-dB directivities from several array elements were measured to be \u00b120\u00b0, which was shown to be an improvement over an identical kerfless array. The -3-dB elevation focus resulting from the TPX lens was measured to be 152 \u03bcm at the focal depth, and the focused lateral resolution was measured to be 80 \u03bcm at a steering angle of 0\u00b0. To generate beam profiles and images, the probe was connected to a commercial ultrasound imaging platform which was reprogrammed to allow for phased array transmit beamforming and receive data collection. The collected RF data were then processed offline using a numerical computing script to generate sector images. The radiation pattern for the beamformed transmit pulse was collected along with images of wire phantoms in water and tissue-equivalent medium with a dynamic range of 60 dB.

In this paper, we present an implementation of the Capon beamformer that exhibits realtime performance when applied in a typical cardiac ultrasound imaging setting. To achieve this performance, we make use of the parallel processing power found in modern graphics processing units (GPUs), combined with beamspace processing to reduce the computational complexity as the number of array elements increases. For a three-dimensional beamspace, we show that processing rates supporting real-time cardiac ultrasound imaging are possible, meaning that images can be processed faster than the image acquisition rate for a wide range of parameters. Image quality is investigated in an in vivo cardiac data set.

These adaptive weighting factors can be implemented effectively with low computational complexity to improve image contrast properties. However, because of low SNR, the resulting images may suffer from deficiencies, including reduced overall image brightness, increased speckle variance, black-region artifacts surrounding hyperechoic objects, and underestimated magnitudes of point targets. To overcome these artifacts, a new spatio-temporal smoothing procedure is introduced to the CF method. It results in a smoothed coherence factor which measures the signal coherence among the beamsums of the divided subarrays over the duration of a transmit pulse. In addition, the procedure is extended to the SCF using the sign bits of the received signals. Simulated and real experimental data sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can improve the robustness of the CF and SCF with reduced speckle variance and significant removal of black-region artifacts, while preserving the ability to suppress clutter. Consequently, image contrast can be enhanced, especially for anechoic cysts.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6689786","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6689765/06689786.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2014.6689786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"182","endPage":"190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporally smoothed coherence factor for ultrasound imaging [Correspondence]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-temporally smoothed coherence factor for ultrasound imaging [Correspondence]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689786/","volume":"61","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6689786/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2014","accessionNumber":"13998240","pubMedId":"24402905","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-temporally smoothed coherence factor for ultrasound imaging [Correspondence]","sourcePdf":"t1410182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145606S","chronDate":"January  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6689765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6689765","articleId":"6689786","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6689809,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Second Research Institute of the China Aerospace Science, Industry Group"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086721613"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6079-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6077-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6078-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689809","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Periodic structures","Substrates","Resonant frequency","Microwave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Long Term Evolution","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact MIMO antenna","LTE terminals","winding antennas","electromagnetic band gap structure","shaped concentric circle","electromagnetic transmission prevention","Long Term Evolution","frequency 2.57 GHz to 2.62 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","electromagnetic band gap","isolation","LTE"]}],"abstract":"A compact MIMO antenna with high isolation for LTE commercial frequency band (2.57 - 2.62 GHz) is presented. The proposed MIMO antenna consists of two winding antennas with similar shape but different direction placed and each of which has the dimension of 15.5 mm \u00d734 mm. The separation between the two antennas is 5 mm (about 4.3% of the wavelength at 2.6 GHz). In order to achieve high isolation performance for such a small separation, an electromagnetic band gap structure is used between two antennas. It consists of an array in which each element is combined by a shaped concentric circle and via hole covered with copper on its inner surface. These elements can act as a high resistance circuit to prevent electromagnetic transmission by which to achieve a high isolation. The isolation of the proposed MIMO antenna can even reach 30 dB at the targeting frequency band.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact MIMO antenna used for LTE terminals with high isolation","publicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689809","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683937/6689805/06689809.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A compact MIMO antenna used for LTE terminals with high isolation","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689809/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14000008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact MIMO antenna used for LTE terminals with high isolation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"AP0008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028375S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683937","isNumber":"6689805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683937","xplore-issue":"6689805","articleId":"6689809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6689816,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"38241633700"},{"name":"Alan Tennant","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Tennant","id":"37277283100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6079-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6077-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6078-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689816","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689816","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Scattering","Phased arrays","Switches","Jamming","Adaptive arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","bow-tie antennas","dipole antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave scattering","Fourier series","phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LCMV beamforming","time-modulated reflector-array","TMRA","linearly constrained minimum variance","phased arrays","phase shifters","array signal processing","8 element linear TMRA","Fourier series","switching sequence","scattering pattern","harmonic frequencies","switchable elements","phased array","bowtie dipole design","full-wave simulator","adaptive nulling","harmonic frequencies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time modulated array","antenna pattern control","reflector array","LCMV beamforming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689816","publicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683937/6689805/06689816.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LCMV beamforming applied to a time-modulated reflector-array: Concept and simulations","abstract":"An adaptive nulling scheme for a time-modulated reflector-array (TMRA) based on linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming is introduced and investigated. Compared to conventional phased arrays or reflector arrays, a TMRA is potentially simpler to implement in hardware as it does not require a complex feed structure or the use of phase shifters. Linearly constrained minimum variance algorithm is used in various applications of array signal processing and in this contribution we apply the scheme to a TMRA. A simple example of 8 element linear TMRA is analysed using Fourier series and array-factor theory. The switching sequence applied to the TMRA is derived from a LCMV algorithm to produce a prescribed scattering pattern at harmonic frequencies. The performance of a theoretical TMRA model consisting of switchable elements is compared to that of a conventional phased array with phase shifters. A TMRA based on bowtie dipole design were constructed and simulated using full-wave simulator to show adaptive nulling at harmonic frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689816/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14000056","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689816/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"LCMV beamforming applied to a time-modulated reflector-array: Concept and simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LCMV beamforming applied to a time-modulated reflector-array: Concept and simulations","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"AP0015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068827S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683937","isNumber":"6689805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683937","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6689805","articleId":"6689816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6689825,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Meng","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'dian University"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Meng","id":"37086717331"},{"name":"Dexiao Wei","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'dian University"],"firstName":"Dexiao","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085526930"},{"name":"Shuhong Gong","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'dian University"],"firstName":"Shuhong","lastName":"Gong","id":"37953310300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6079-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6077-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6078-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689825","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Scattering","Receiving antennas","Azimuth","Approximation methods","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","electromagnetic wave polarisation","electromagnetic wave scattering","MIMO communication","rain","receiving antennas","satellite antennas","satellite ground stations","wavelength assignment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power angle spectrum","satellite-to-ground communication downlink","rainfall environment","rain attenuation","single scattering approximation","Mie method","PAS","receive antenna","plane wave normal incident condition","wavelength characteristics","polarization characteristics","multiple-input multiple-output technology","MIMO system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single scattering approximation","satellite-to-ground communication downlink","power angle spectrum (PAS)"]}],"abstract":"The rain attenuation at the single scattering approximation is calculated with Mie method.

CDMA based multi-user communication system experiencing frequency dependent multi-path fading. If the spreading codes are orthogonal and the channel is frequency-flat, the traditional Rake receiver is optimal. However, frequency-selective fading channels destroy the orthogonality of the spreading codes and the chip-level equalizer is proved effectively to restore the orthogonality[1]. For further improvement, the best delay is chosen to minimize the MSE. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the chip equalizer, this paper presents a novel block iterative LMMSE(B_LMMSE) algorithm. Simulations are carried in time-varying frequency-selective fading environment and show that prosed algorithm achieve great performances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6689943/","accessionNumber":"14000109","displayDocTitle":"A low complexity approach of chip-level MMSE equalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity approach of chip-level MMSE equalization","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"SP0015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057255S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683937","isNumber":"6689805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683937","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6689805","articleId":"6689943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6689950,"authors":[{"name":"Meirong Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing Jiao tong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Meirong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086717906"},{"name":"Dongping Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing Jiao tong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongping","lastName":"Yao","id":"37287474000"},{"name":"Bo Ai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiao tong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Ai","id":"37270328400"},{"name":"Weihua Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Beijing Jiao tong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086722518"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6079-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6077-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6078-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689950","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"The next-generation LTE standards operating on high-speed trains faces the problems about fast time-selective and frequency-selective channel. Precoding relying on accurate channel information at the transmitter or receive feedback will be less effective in such scenarios. Based on WINNER D2a channel model for high-speed railway, double differential space- frequency precoding scheme is proposed. Double differential space-frequency block coding is introduced into frequency domain in an OFDM system. It does not require any channel state information, with low complexity and antenna diversity gains at the transceiver. More importantly, the scheme should be robust to handle doppler shift It's shown that the proposed scheme keeps good performance in the WINNER D2a channel for high-speed

However, when it evolves to LTE-A, more transmit antennas are needed for higher spectrum efficiency, which means more reference signals. In the physical uplink share channel (PUSCH) of LTE-A, the estimated channel based on sounding reference signal (SRS) is used for precoder and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection. In this paper, an improved SRS design is proposed, which achieves minimum interference between different reference signals. More importantly, it is perfectly backwards compatible with the SRS in LTE uplink. In addition, we propose an improved SRS channel estimation for multiple transmit antennas. Simulation results show that the proposed SRS design leads to less channel estimation error, and the proposed SRS channel estimation can reach similar accuracy to exponential power delay profile (PDP) channel estimation, while with much lower complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689805","publicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683937/6689805/06689959.pdf","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved SRS design and channel estimation for LTE-advanced uplink","doi":"10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689959","startPage":"84","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Improved SRS design and channel estimation for LTE-advanced uplink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689959/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","accessionNumber":"14000058","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6689959/","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved SRS design and channel estimation for LTE-advanced uplink","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"WI0044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041592S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683937","isNumber":"6689805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683937","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6689805","articleId":"6689959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6689961,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, P.

Most of the existing IA schemes are aimed to optimize the sum-capacity, the error probability, and the mean square errors (MSE) of the system, and less consider the system power efficiency. This paper proposes a new IA scheme to minimize the system transmit power under the condition of every user's MSE constraint through a joint design of linear transmitter and receiver for a K-user MIMO interference system. In order to solve our optimization problem, we employ the Lagrange function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, then get the transmitter precoding and receiving filter matrices expressions by the analysis and derivation. Finally, we use a joint iterative algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. Simulation results verify that the provided scheme improves the power efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design of linear transmitter and receiver for the MIMO interference channel","publicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689961","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683937/6689805/06689961.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint design of linear transmitter and receiver for the MIMO interference channel","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689961/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14000003","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint design of linear transmitter and receiver for the MIMO interference channel","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"WI0049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059542S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683937","isNumber":"6689805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683937","xplore-issue":"6689805","articleId":"6689961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6689964,"authors":[{"name":"Na Hou","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086713767"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Shaohui Sun","affiliation":["CATT, State Key Laboratory of Wireless Mobile Communication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaohui","lastName":"Sun","id":"38548103400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6079-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6077-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6078-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6689964","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6689964","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Discrete Fourier transforms","Uplink","Time-domain analysis","Phase shift keying","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate","BER","error vector magnitude","single carrier frequency division multiple access spectrum","SC-FDMA spectrum","physical uplink shared channel","part control information","Long Term Evolution system data information","LTE system","PUSCH channel","test analysis","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","PUSCH","SC-FDMA","EVM"]}],"abstract":"In the LTE (Long Term Evolution) system data information and part control information are transmitted on the PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel).

In general, the indoor localization techniques include trilateral, triangulation and fingerprinting localization. As an important alternative, fingerprinting localization techniques are extensively studied and applied in the existing localization systems. This paper presents an overview of the fingerprinting localization system based on the received signal strength (RSS) in indoor wireless LAN (WLAN) environments. In particular, we describe the structure of localization system and then analyze the challenges that most existing research works try to deal with. Corresponding solutions and several pattern matching algorithms are also presented. Furthermore, we demonstrate a comparative study of existing fingerprinting localization systems and address the possible directions of future research in indoor localization techniques.","doi":"10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689973","publicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","startPage":"160","endPage":"164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAPE.2013.6689973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689805","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683937/6689805/06689973.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th IEEE International Symposium on Microwave, Antenna, Propagation and EMC Technologies for Wireless Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingerprint recognition","Accuracy","Wireless LAN","Pattern matching","Complexity theory","Estimation","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor localization technique","trilateral localization","triangulation localization","fingerprinting localization techniques","received signal strength","RSS","indoor wireless LAN environments","pattern matching algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RSS","WLAN","fingerprinting localization","indoor environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Overview of received signal strength based fingerprinting localization in indoor wireless LAN environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6689973/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6689973/","accessionNumber":"14000034","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of received signal strength based fingerprinting localization in indoor wireless LAN environments","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"WI0062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063368S","chronDate":"29-31 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683937","isNumber":"6689805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683937","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6689805","articleId":"6689973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
