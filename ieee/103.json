Key attributes of these new types of networked systems are the severely constrained computational and energy resources, and an ad hoc operational environment. This paper is a study of the communication security aspects of these networks. Resource limitations and specific architecture of sensor networks call for customized security mechanisms. Our approach is to classify the types of data existing in sensor networks, and identify possible communication security threats according to that classification. We propose a communication security scheme where for each type of data we define a corresponding security mechanism. By employing this multitiered security architecture where each mechanism has different resource requirements, we allow for efficient resource management, which is essential for wireless sensor networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On communication security in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Reported works justify this fact arguing that noise injection is equivalent to a smoothing regularization with the input noise variance playing the role of the regularization parameter. The success of this approach depends on the appropriate choice of the input noise variance. However, it is often not known a priori if the degree of smoothness imposed on the FNN mapping is consistent with the unknown function to be approximated. In order to have a better control over this smoothing effect, a cost function putting in balance the smoothed fitting induced by the noise injection and the precision of approximation, is proposed. The second term, which aims at penalizing the undesirable effect of input noise injection or controlling the deviation of the random perturbed cost, was obtained by expressing a certain distance between the original cost function and its random perturbed version. In fact, this term can be derived in general for parametrical. models that satisfy the Lipschitz property. An example is included to illustrate the effectiveness of learning with this proposed cost function when noise injection is used.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030026","startPage":"149","endPage":"158","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030026.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On learning feedforward neural networks with noise injection into inputs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030026/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On learning feedforward neural networks with noise injection into inputs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030026/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7535444","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On learning feedforward neural networks with noise injection into inputs","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068936S","chronDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1030035,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenkun Gou","affiliation":["Applied Computational Intelligence Research Unit, University of Paisley, UK"],"lastName":"Zhenkun Gou","id":"37087267889"},{"name":"C.

This model allows us to vary a single parameter so that the network is capable of performing partial least squares regression (at one extreme) to canonical correlation analysis (at the other) and every intermediate operation between the two. On multicollinear data, the parameter setting is shown to be important but on more general data no particular parameter setting is required. Finally, the algorithm acts on such data as a smoother in that the resulting weight vectors are much smoother and more interpretable than the weights without the robustification term.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Neural networks","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Computational intelligence","Algorithm design and analysis","Least squares methods","Performance analysis","Vectors","Statistical analysis","Singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","neural nets","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust canonical correlation neural network","canonical correlation analysis","ridge regression","data sets","multicollinear data","partial least squares regression","weight vectors smoothing"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030035","startPage":"239","endPage":"248","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030035.pdf","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust canonical correlation neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A robust canonical correlation neural network","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7535453","publicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1030035/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust canonical correlation neural network","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101246S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1030045,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yankun","affiliation":["The Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Zhang Yankun","id":"37088010232"},{"name":"Liu Chongqing","affiliation":["The Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China"],"lastName":"Liu Chongqing","id":"37088008898"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7616-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1030045","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":340},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030045","abstract":"Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) as a powerful nonlinear feature extraction method has proven as a preprocessing step for classification algorithm.

This strategy was tested on a real-life database using neural networks trained in one-versus-all configuration.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","startPage":"375","endPage":"384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-sample multi-source model for biometric authentication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multi-sample multi-source model for biometric authentication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030049/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535467","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1030049/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-sample multi-source model for biometric authentication","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04161S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1030051,"authors":[{"name":"R.V.

We propose a new method which uses LMS filters in the frequency domain to estimate the residual crosstalk components in separated signals. The estimated components are removed by non-stational spectral subtraction.

The algorithm tackles the problem of convolved mixtures by explicitly exploiting the non-stationarity of the acoustic sources. The learning rule is based on second-order statistics and is derived by natural gradient minimization. The proposed initialization of the algorithm is based on the null beamforming principle. This method leads to improved separation performance, and the algorithm is able to estimate long unmixing FIR filters in the time domain due to the geometric initialization. We also propose a post-filtering method for dewhitening which is based on the scaling technique in frequency-domain BSS. The validity of the proposed method is shown by computer simulations. Our experimental results confirm that the algorithm is capable of separating real-world speech mixtures and can be applied to short learning data sets down to a few seconds. Our results also confirm that the proposed dewhitening post-filtering method maintains the spectral content of the original speech in the separated output.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030056.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"454","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time domain blind source separation of non-stationary convolved signals by utilizing geometric beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Source separation","Finite impulse response filter","Speech","Frequency domain analysis","Array signal processing","Acoustic sensors","Laboratories","Time domain analysis","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain analysis","blind source separation","speech processing","convolution","acoustic signal processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis","minimisation","FIR filters","filtering theory","adaptive signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain blind source separation","nonstationary convolved signals","geometric beamforming","time-domain BSS algorithm","sensor positions","source locations","nonstationary acoustic sources","learning rule","second-order statistics","natural gradient minimization","algorithm initialization","null beamforming","separation performance","long unmixing FIR filters","geometric initialization","post-filtering method","scaling technique","frequency-domain BSS","computer simulations","real-world speech mixtures","short learning data sets","dewhitening post-filtering method","speech spectral content"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Time domain blind source separation of non-stationary convolved signals by utilizing geometric beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535474","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain blind source separation of non-stationary convolved signals by utilizing geometric beamforming","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05354S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1030061,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An ICA-assisted interference canceler was proposed by Ristaniemi, Raju and Karhunen (see Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. on Communications, New York, USA, April 2002). This receiver structure is an extension to the framework proposed by Belouchrani and Amin (see Signal Processing, vol.80, p.723-29, 2000), in which blind source separation (BSS) techniques were utilized to the jammer mitigation problem. A common feature for both is that they apply an advanced pre-processing tool to offer an unjammed signal for conventional detection. However, it is not always desirable to apply the pre-processing tool, since it might even cause additional interference if the jammer is weak or absent. What would make the receivers more practical is to switch the additional canceler active only whenever it is expected to improve conventional detection. We compare two possible switching strategies at both ends of the receiver chain, pre- and post-switching schemes, and evaluate their impacts to the overall performance improvement of the array receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030061.pdf","startPage":"495","endPage":"504","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jammer cancellation in DS-CDMA arrays: pre and post switching of ICA and RAKE","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Multiaccess communication","Independent component analysis","Interference cancellation","Switches","Communication switching","Spread spectrum communication","Antenna accessories","Antenna arrays","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent component analysis","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","multiuser detection","jamming","interference suppression","antenna arrays","receiving antennas","radio receivers","source separation","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-switching","jammer cancellation","DS-CDMA arrays","pre-switching","RAKE","independent component analysis","blind interference cancellation","direct sequence spread spectrum communication","DS-SS","antenna arrays","ICA-assisted interference canceler","receiver structure","blind source separation","pre-processing tool","signal detection","array receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Jammer cancellation in DS-CDMA arrays: pre and post switching of ICA and RAKE","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535479","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jammer cancellation in DS-CDMA arrays: pre and post switching of ICA and RAKE","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067636S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1030062,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535485","htmlLink":"/document/1030067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Non-negative sparse coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-negative sparse coding","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049169S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"400","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1030072,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The considered application is an automated call center that provides traffic information through a voice dialogue system. The connection to the call center is achieved by means of a commercial device placed in the car and made up of a microphone which is placed in front of the driver and equipped with an echo canceller and built-in noise reduction. The connection with the call center is set up through a GSM link. By experiment, the LIN technique adapts the basic neural network speech recognizer to this new environment. Some variants devoted to reducing the number of estimated parameters are also introduced. The LIN technique, is also compared with some classical denoising techniques based on noise spectral subtraction. The obtained results confirm the validity of LIN for channel and noise adaptation, while the introduced variants are a valid alternative when a reduced model size is important. The best performances in our specific application were of 57.14% error reduction versus the performance obtained by general acoustic models and were achieved by joint use of a LIN and noise spectral subtraction.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030073","startPage":"617","endPage":"626","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030073.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear input network for neural network automata model adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Automata","Adaptation model","Noise reduction","Working environment noise","Acoustic noise","Speech recognition","Speech enhancement","Automatic speech recognition","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","acoustic noise","signal denoising","speech recognition","traffic information systems","natural language interfaces","parameter estimation","spectral analysis","automata theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear input networks","neural network automata","channel adaptation","noise adaptation","Loquendo neural network","speech recognition","automated call center","traffic information","voice dialogue system","echo cancellation","noise reduction","GSM","parameter estimation","noise spectral subtraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Linear input network for neural network automata model adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030073/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7535491","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear input network for neural network automata model adaptation","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052067S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1030077,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The perceptron, which has weights obtained by learning when adapting the original signal, suppresses the difference between the reconstructed signal and the original signal even when the Nyquist condition does not stand.

Conventional neural network based acquisition systems are usually trained on PN code, but this system is based on training a back propagation neural network at all possible phases of the output of a correlation detector which is modified by a recursive accumulator. The recursive accumulator can converge the input of the neural network into a limited sample space, and the BP neural network acquires the phase of the received PN code from the converged data. The advantages of this system are that the gain of the system is controllable and the training data sample space is limited. The BP neural network is used to distinguish the transmitted signal and noise. Computer simulations show that the proposed system can acquire the phase of the received PN code correctly at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in an AWGN channel.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030092","startPage":"737","endPage":"745","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8007/22134/01030092.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Workshop on Neural Networks for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive BP neural network (ABPNN) based PN code acquisition system via recursive accumulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Signal to noise ratio","Phase detection","Detectors","Control systems","Training data","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","backpropagation","neural nets","pseudonoise codes","correlation methods","convergence of numerical methods","AWGN channels","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive backpropagation neural network","adaptive BP neural network","PN code acquisition","recursive accumulator","training data","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","AWGN channel","direct sequence spread spectrum communication","DS-SS communication","code synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive BP neural network (ABPNN) based PN code acquisition system via recursive accumulator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030092/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7535503","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive BP neural network (ABPNN) based PN code acquisition system via recursive accumulator","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061036S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1030094,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We investigate whether we can construct an adaptive signal processing device that learns by example how to generate new instances of a given musical style. Because recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can, in principle, learn the temporal structure of a signal, they are good candidates for such a task. Unfortunately, music composed by standard RNNs often lacks global coherence. The reason for this failure seems to be that RNNs cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has succeeded in similar domains where other RNNs have failed, such as timing and counting and the learning of context sensitive languages. We show that LSTM is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music. We present experimental results showing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and we believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure, it does not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535504","htmlLink":"/document/1030094/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Finding temporal structure in music: blues improvisation with LSTM recurrent networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding temporal structure in music: blues improvisation with LSTM recurrent networks","confLoc":"Martigny, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1030094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041704S","chronDate":"6-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8007","isNumber":"22134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8007","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"22134","articleId":"1030094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1030103,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The full duplex operation of these systems requires that the transmitter and the receiver operate simultaneously. When a handset is operating at maximum distance from the base station within a given cell, the high transmitter output power necessary to communicate with the distant base station is in direct conflict with the receiver operating at maximum sensitivity. The transmitter leakage power through the duplexer is usually significantly higher than the desired signal channel through the first few elements of the receiver. As a result, the transmitter leakage becomes the dominating effect for nonlinearities for the first LNA (low noise amplifier) in the receiver chain. This paper focuses on the effects of cross modulation in a WCDMA system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WCDMA cross modulation effects and implications for receiver linearity requirements","publicationTitle":"Proceedings RAWCON 2002. 2002 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

Consequently, the delay time of the delayed waves can typically become greater than the duration of one symbol and delay spread handling by traditional adaptive equalization is not an easy task. OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) is a spectrum efficient kind of multicarrier transmission. Using OFDM-techniques makes it possible to reduce the effects of multipath fading and thus complex equalizers at the receiver side can be avoided. The principles, technology and limits of OFDM are introduced and discussed. Special attention is given to SNR-problems and to synchronization in time and frequency at the receiver. OFDM is a strong candidate for the future generation of wireless communications. The performance of an OFDM-based system is limited by the system speed and the synchronization-ability and also by the given antenna concept. Thus the required future communication performance is not obtained only by improvements of the OFDM-concept but also by advanced diversity techniques and adaptive antenna technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings RAWCON 2002. 2002 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

The \"dead circle\" encloses those signal points that cannot be represented by sum or the two branch signals with any possible phase difference. The mismatch also introduces some phase skew to the resulting signal. The ELINC system can remove the phase skew and have higher tolerance to the adverse effects of the \"dead circle\".

The technique utilizes a sampling downconverter that accurately captures a waveform sample in a narrow aperture before digitization. Because aliasing effects are the same for both input and output waveforms, information may be obtained regarding the amplitude and phase distortion characteristics of the power amplifier. The concept is validated using a test bed consisting of two sampling downconverters and a dual channel receiver. Results achieved indicate that 10-12 dB of adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) improvement may be obtain using sampling rates as low as 33% of the Nyquist rate of the baseband output signal bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/RAWCON.2002.1030160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAWCON.2002.1030160","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings RAWCON 2002. 2002 IEEE Radio and Wireless Conference (Cat.

In particular, we first report the results of an analysis that we performed on power dissipation in VDSM fault-tolerant busses using Hamming single error correcting codes. We show that no power saving is possible by choosing between different optimal Hamming codes with the same redundancy. We then propose a new coding scheme which provides a reduction of the energy consumption and power-delay product of over the 11.5% and 45%, respectively, with respect to the optimal (7,4) Hamming code, for a 0.13/spl mu/m CMOS technology bus.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International On-Line Testing Workshop (IOLTW 2002)","pdfPath":"/iel5/8008/22136/01030176.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Eighth IEEE International On-Line Testing Workshop (IOLTW 2002)","doi":"10.1109/OLT.2002.1030176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OLT.2002.1030176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22136","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding scheme for low energy consumption fault-tolerant bus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Fault tolerance","Error correction codes","Capacitance","Crosstalk","CMOS technology","Testing","Wires","Power dissipation","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system buses","fault tolerant computing","error correction codes","Hamming codes","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant bus","error correcting code","low energy consumption","very deep submicron bus","power-delay product","optimal Hamming code","CMOS technology bus","bus electrical model","capacitance model","optimal coding scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Coding scheme for low energy consumption fault-tolerant bus","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7425798","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"10-10 July 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding scheme for low energy consumption fault-tolerant bus","confLoc":"Bendor, France","sourcePdf":"01030176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057961S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8008","isNumber":"22136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8008","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"22136","articleId":"1030176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":1030188,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The technique presents a very low analog overhead and it is completely digital. For the System-on-Chip (SoC) environment, this allows the implementation of on-line test using processing power already present in the system. As all the signal processing is done in the digital domain, it allows use of a purely digital tester or a digital BIST technique. The main principle of operation is based on the observation of statistical properties of the circuit under test. Due to the low analog power and performance overhead, the proposed technique can be used to analyze the output of several stages of complex analog systems without the use of switches or analog multiplexors, as no additional AD converter is needed. This paper presents the fundamentals of the proposed test method and some preliminary results concerning linear analog systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-10 July 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1030188/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7425810","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A statistical sampler for a new on-line analog test method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical sampler for a new on-line analog test method","confLoc":"Bendor, France","sourcePdf":"01030188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047966S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8008","isNumber":"22136","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8008","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"22136","articleId":"1030188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1030201,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

This paper analyses the use of various 3- and 4-element redundant digit sets for radix 2, and compares their adder implementations using various encodings of the digits and carries. It is shown that theoretically they are equivalent, and differences in their implementations need only be very marginal. Another recent proposal for the use of the digit-set {0, 1, 2, 3}, with a special 3-bit encoding of digits, is analyzed and some optimizations are shown, including the possibility of using a 2-bit encoding, simplifying the wiring of a multiplier tree. All these proposed designs are shown to be equivalent to a standard 4-to-2, carry-save adder except possibly for a few signal inversions.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2002.1030721","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application- Specific Systems, Architectures, and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application- Specific Systems, Architectures, and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/8009/22137/01030721.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2002.1030721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22137","startPage":"218","endPage":"229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reviewing 4-to-2 adders for multi-operand addition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reviewing 4-to-2 adders for multi-operand addition","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030721/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2002","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7468396","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1030721/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reviewing 4-to-2 adders for multi-operand addition","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01030721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047558S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8009","isNumber":"22137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8009","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"22137","articleId":"1030721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1030725,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In two-dimensional images, the objects can be represented through multiscale decomposition as tree structures. The pattern tree representing an object can be matched with a subject tree representing an image in order to detect the objects within the image. In this paper, we describe a new systolic algorithm and its realization as a VLSI chip for tree pattern matching. The hardware algorithm is based on a linear array of processing elements (PEs) where the pattern matching is done in a pipelined fashion relying on nearest-neighbor communication between the PEs and the subject and pattern trees of arbitrary length can be processed using a fixed size PE array. The algorithm has an improved execution time of O(/spl lceil/m/a/spl rceil/n) required to perform the matching where in, a and n are the sizes of the pattern tree, processor array, subject tree respectively. A prototype CMOS VLSI chip implementing the proposed algorithm has been designed and verified It is shown that the hardware algorithm proposed in this work represent a significant improvement in terms of computational complexity, data flow, and architecture over the ones previously proposed for this problem.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2002.1030731","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application- Specific Systems, Architectures, and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Application- Specific Systems, Architectures, and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/8009/22137/01030731.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"334","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2002.1030731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A VLSI architecture for object recognition using tree matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"A VLSI architecture for object recognition using tree matching","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1030731/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7468406","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030731/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A VLSI architecture for object recognition using tree matching","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01030731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062294S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8009","isNumber":"22137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8009","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22137","articleId":"1030731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1030732,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

Data-centric mechanisms that perform in-network aggregation of data are needed in this setting for energy-efficient information flow. In this paper we model data-centric routing and compare its performance with traditional end-to-end routing schemes. We examine the impact of source-destination placement and communication network density on the energy costs and delay associated with data aggregation. We show that data-centric routing offers significant performance gains across a wide range of operational scenarios. We also examine the complexity of optimal data aggregation, showing that although it is an NP-hard problem in general, there exist useful polynomial-time special cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7404161","htmlLink":"/document/1030829/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The impact of data aggregation in wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of data aggregation in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"01030829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038301S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8010","isNumber":"22138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8010","citationCount":"676","xplore-issue":"22138","articleId":"1030829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1030893,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The second method considered is the Bakis length modeling where the number of model states is set to a given fraction of the average number of observations of the corresponding character. In the third modeling scheme the number of model states is set to a specified quantile of the corresponding character length histogram. This method is called quantile length modeling. A comparison of different length modeling schemes was carried out with a handwriting recognition system using off-line images of cursively handwritten English words from the IAM database. For the fixed length modeling, a recognition rate of 61% was achieved. Using the Bakis or quantile length modeling the word recognition rates could be improved to over 69%.","doi":"10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030938","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/8011/22139/01030938.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov model length optimization for handwriting recognition systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030938/","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov model length optimization for handwriting recognition systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7432920","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030938/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov model length optimization for handwriting recognition systems","confLoc":"Niagra-on-the-Lake, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01030938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056358S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8011","isNumber":"22139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8011","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"22139","articleId":"1030938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1030945,"authors":[{"name":"C.I.

Then, word mappings are refined using word recognition results by a dynamic programming algorithm that finds the best match while satisfying the constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/8011/22139/01030945.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"418","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doi":"10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1030945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transcript mapping for historic handwritten document images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Indexing","Optical character recognition software","Venus","Dynamic programming","Heuristic algorithms","Availability","Image retrieval","Prototypes","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document image processing","image segmentation","handwritten character recognition","indexing","humanities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["historic handwritten document images","visual word spotting","lexicon reduction","dynamic programming","word recognition mapping","word segmentation","indexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Transcript mapping for historic handwritten document images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1030945/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7432927","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transcript mapping for historic handwritten document images","confLoc":"Niagra-on-the-Lake, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01030945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048778S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8011","isNumber":"22139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8011","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"22139","articleId":"1030945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":1030952,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is an important step because incorrectly segmented characters are unlikely to be recognized correctly. The most difficult case in character segmentation is the cursive script. The scripted nature of Arabic written language poses some high challenges for automatic character segmentation and recognition. In this paper, a new character segmentation algorithm (ACSA) of Arabic scripts is presented. The developed segmentation algorithm yields on the segmentation of isolated handwritten words in perfectly separated characters. It is based on morphological rules, which are constructed at the feature extraction phase. Finally, ACSA is combined with an existing handwritten Arabic character recognition system (RECAM).","doi":"10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030952","pdfPath":"/iel5/8011/22139/01030952.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"457","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Eighth International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWFHR.2002.1030952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-line handwritten Arabic character segmentation algorithm: ACSA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1030952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Off-line handwritten Arabic character segmentation algorithm: ACSA","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7432934","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1030952/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-line handwritten Arabic character segmentation algorithm: ACSA","confLoc":"Niagra-on-the-Lake, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"01030952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049227S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8011","isNumber":"22139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8011","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"22139","articleId":"1030952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1030957,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Each micromachined corner mirror is constituted by three elements: a vertical mirror, a movable horizontal mirror, and a bottom electrode. The corner micromirror is able to provide actuation on one of the reflective planes, causing destruction of preset orthogonal planes. Incorporated with a grating and other optical components, the new array may provide simultaneous wavelength selection in free space and switching function for wavelength as well as intensity.

The fast acquisition is accomplished by a 500 kHz loop bandwidth at the initial acquisition state and followed by a 50 kHz loop bandwidth at the steady state. The AGC is implemented in 0.6 /spl mu/m SPTM CMOS technology. According to the post-layout simulation, it achieves an acquisition time of 5 /spl mu/s and provides a constant output of 1V/sub pp/ at a 50 /spl Omega/ load for 20 dB input signal amplitude range. The dual-loop AGC consumes 88 mW power from a single 3.3 V supply and occupies 1.8/spl times/1.8 mm/sup 2/ area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7516262","htmlLink":"/document/1031548/","conferenceDate":"8-8 Aug. 2002","displayDocTitle":"A dual-loop automatic gain control for infrared communication system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual-loop automatic gain control for infrared communication system","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1031548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033633S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8021","isNumber":"22152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8021","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"22152","articleId":"1031548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1031554,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A detailed analysis of noise and linearity for the cascode architecture, a widely used circuit structure in LNA designs, is presented in this paper. The noise and the linearity improvement techniques for cascode structures are also developed and have been proven by computer simulation experiments. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that, for LNAs with the cascode structure, the first MOSFET dominates the noise performances of the LNA, while the second MOSFET contributes more to the linearities. A conclusion is thus obtained that the first and second MOSFET of the LNA can be designed to optimize the noise performance and the linearity performance separately, without trade-offs. 1.9 GHz CMOS LNA simulation results are also given as an application of the developed theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-8 Aug. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1031580/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7516283","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The noise and linearity optimization for a 1.9-GHz CMOS low noise amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The noise and linearity optimization for a 1.9-GHz CMOS low noise amplifier","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1031580.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042843S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8021","isNumber":"22152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8021","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"22152","articleId":"1031580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1031581,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Chia-Hsin Wu","id":"37087265783"},{"name":"Chih-Chun Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Chih-Chun Tang","id":"37087366702"},{"name":"Shen-Iuan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"lastName":"Shen-Iuan Liu","id":"37087144064"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7363-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1031581","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spirals","Inductors","Capacitance","Predictive models","Scattering parameters","Q factor","Frequency","Strontium","Inductance","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductors","capacitance","S-parameters","Q-factor","CMOS integrated circuits","radiofrequency integrated circuits","integrated circuit measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip spiral inductors","distributed capacitance model","S parameter","quality factor","self-resonant frequency","series inductance","equivalent capacitance","series resistance","stacked inductor","planar inductor","CMOS","0.25 micron","0.35 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1031581","abstract":"The characteristics of on-chip inductors such as the S parameter, the quality factor (Q), and the self-resonant frequency (f/sub SR/) can be determined by its series inductance, equivalent capacitance, and series resistance.

This paper proposes a CFRS decoder chip for fast, multi-speed decoding in this application. With this fast decoder, realization of more sophisticated cell search algorithms that may be needed in some application scenarios will become feasible. Besides, a multi-speed decoding can be implemented within the same architecture. Multi-speed decoding equips a mobile for being able to use different algorithms in different cell search scenarios. The decoder achieves low power dissipation with low clock rate as well as fast decoding for a cordless mobile by using a folding systolic architecture. Finally, the proposed CFRS decoder is realized in a 3.3-V 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology with 2.2/spl times/2.2-mm/sup 2/ core area and 13.3/1.23-mW power dissipation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comma-free Reed-Solomon decoder chip for W-CDMA/FDD applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The site and the characteristics of the data collection system are described. Thereafter, an algorithm of calculation of the travel time is developed and validated. It is based on the measurements provided by the loop sensors located on the road section links. A database of travel times -considered as travel times of reference-is thus made up. It provides knowledge on the statistical indicators of the travel time. The sample sizes of probe vehicles can then be determined. Traffic states are taken into account through a preliminary segmentation in levels of service. A sensitivity analysis of the main factors influencing the size of the samples is carried out while the limits of the exercise are also identified. Conclusions include a comparison between the probe vehicles approach and the traditional practices in road traffic management.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20020227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20020227","startPage":"172","endPage":"176","displayPublicationTitle":"Eleventh International Conference on Road Transport Information and Control, 2002.

The use of specific voltage sensors can be avoided if the reference voltage signals can be used instead of the actual (measured) phase voltages. Thus, an accurate compensation of most of inverter non-idealities is essential in modern sensorless control as well as in all applications that foresee flux-estimation. This paper presents a step towards the optimal inverter nonidealities compensation for high-performance sensorless drives application. The proposed start-up offline procedure does not require the exact power components parameters, and it can be readily implemented on existing hardware structure, without any additional external circuit. For validation purposes, the algorithm has been merged with a full-digital sensorless control of an induction motor drive, exploiting the computation facilities of the floating point DSP TMS320C31.

The flywheel system relies on technology developed over more than 30 years for URENCO's high speed gas centrifuge and has itself undergone several further years of development. It is now the most advanced commercially available flywheel energy storage system. Its unique features, zero maintenance, 20 year life and high cyclic capability make it ideally suited to applications in rail power supplies. The flywheel system can resolve many of the problems encountered in traction supplies due to the 'peaky' nature of the loads caused by trains accelerating and braking. In addition, the UPT system can provide energy savings by improving the system's receptivity to energy from trains with regenerative braking. This paper describes how the system was applied to London Underground's Piccadilly line for a trial application and presents some of the data from these tests. This successful trial has now led to the first commercial application with the New York City Transit Authority. Finally, the paper reviews some of the possible developments which may lead to the application of this technology to higher voltage systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031704/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"7314444","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2002","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Flywheel energy storage system for traction applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flywheel energy storage system for traction applications","confLoc":"Sante Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"1031704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045797S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2002","isNumber":"22154","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8023","citationCount":"31","articleId":"1031704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1031729,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Meanwhile, the fast growth of the Internet demands more data switching capacity in the network in order to deliver high bandwidth to end users. Although the capacity of electronic routers has been increasing consistently in the past, optical switching appears to be a more cost-effective way to switch individual wavelengths. As the bit rate per wavelength channel continues to grow, optical subwavelength switching emerges as a new paradigm capable of dynamically delivering the vast bandwidth WDM offers. This article discusses one of such techniques, namely optical packet switching, and its performance perceived by end users in optical mesh networks. Specifically, our investigation reveals the benefit of using electrical ingress buffering and traffic aggregation to reduce packet-loss rate of optical packet-switched networks. Through simulation experiments, we present an evaluation of the network's TCP-level performance based on the proposed architecture.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2002.1031831","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/22155/01031831.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2002.1031831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical ingress buffering and traffic aggregation for optical packet switching and their effect on TCP-level performance in optical mesh networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1031831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031831/","displayDocTitle":"Electrical ingress buffering and traffic aggregation for optical packet switching and their effect on TCP-level performance in optical mesh networks","volume":"40","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7377253","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1031831/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical ingress buffering and traffic aggregation for optical packet switching and their effect on TCP-level performance in optical mesh networks","sourcePdf":"01031831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038528S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"22155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"22155","articleId":"1031831","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1031832,"authors":[{"name":"I.

A comparison with classical EKF based data association methods such as the nearest neighbor (NN) method and the JPDA method is made. The NN association method is also applied to the particle filter method. Multiple target tracking using particle filtering increases the computational burden, therefore a control structure for the number of samples needed is proposed.

From the estimated parameter sets, a precise reconstruction of the multidimensional wave field in the aperture domains of time, frequency and space is possible. Since the measurement antenna properties are excluded from the channel, the influence of a variety of other array architectures can be investigated with the reconstructed wave field.

Moshavi et al. (see Int. J. Wireless Inf. Networks, vol.3, no.1, p.1-17, 1996) combined with recent results in random matrix theory were found to be powerful low-complexity tools to mitigate interference on MIMO communication channels (see Muller, R.R. and Verdu, S., IEEE J. Selected Areas in Comm. vol.19, no.8, p.1429-41, 2001). The random matrix model of communication via antenna arrays characterizes the channel in terms of its asymptotic eigenvalue distribution by a single parameter. Muller (see Proc. European Personal Mobile Comm. Conf., 2001) generalises the polynomial expansion of Muller and Verdu to MIMO communication channels promising very good performance at complexity per bit that grows only linearly with the number of antennas. The reliability of Muller's results strongly depends on the accuracy of the used asymptotic random matrix model to describe the antenna array channel. We provide measured performance results for the receiver in terms of bit error rate and signal-to-interference ratio for communication over real-world indoor MIMO channels. Computer simulations show that, for more than 5 antennas, performance with the measured data is close to the prediction found with the asymptotic random matrix models used by Muller and only a little behind the performance of far more complex receivers, such as the linear MMSE receiver, that involve matrix inversions to combat crosstalk.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Seminar on MIMO: Communications Systems from Concept to Implementations (Ref.

We investigate space-frequency trellis coded modulations (SFTCM) along with a number of BLAST detection algorithms: ML, successive interference cancellation (original BLAST); linear ZF; ZF-ML hybrid. Since BLAST enhances mainly the data throughput and the SFTCM improves primarily the link quality, we also propose a scheme that efficiently distributes available degrees of freedom between spatial multiplexing and the diversity.

By using channel impulse response measurement data collected in the real fields, link-level performances of the signal processing algorithms in the fields such as bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) performances can be evaluated. This technique is called link-level simulation. Through statistical analysis of link-level simulation results, system-level performances of space/time (S/T) equalizers; such as SINR and BER distributions in the area of interest can also be evaluated. This technique is called system-level simulation. This paper focuses on link- and system-level performances of S/T- and MIMO turbo-equalizers in real fields. Methodologies for the link- and system-level simulations using field measurement data are first presented. Results of link- and system-level simulations using two-dimensional channel sounding field measurement data collected in Tokyo are then presented. The assumption made in this paper is that multiple users aim to transmit their signals using the same time- and frequency-slots without spreading their signals in the frequency domain, which is an ultimate goal of cellular mobile communication engineering. It is shown that S/T- and MIMO turbo equalizers make this ultimate goal realistic.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Seminar on MIMO: Communications Systems from Concept to Implementations (Ref.

It is designed to maximise throughput on the downlink by transmitting data from the base station (BS) to the mobile station (MS) at the highest data rate that can be supported by the channel. This is achieved by constantly monitoring the channel conditions and adapting the modulation and coding of the signal accordingly. At any time, the BS will be transmitting at full power to a single user selected using proportional fairness scheduling. This favours users when their channels are at their best. We have developed a model which simulates an HDR network with multiple transmit and receive antennas. The model, which includes correlated shadowing and Rayleigh fading, generates results for throughput using proportional fairness scheduling. For N transmit antennas it is assumed that the transmitter knows the channel coefficients and forms N orthogonal 'eigenvalue' channels between the BS and MS. We give results showing how the throughput varies with the number of users per cell for different numbers of transmit and receive antennas.","doi":"10.1049/ic:20010199","publicationTitle":"IEE Seminar on MIMO: Communications Systems from Concept to Implementations (Ref.

The clusters arrive with a uniform probability density in azimuth angle, whilst rays within a cluster arrive with a Laplacian probability density with angular spread /spl sigma/. Using Monte Carlo type simulations, assuming 'narrowband' channel conditions and 'single bounce' scattering between TX and RX, we make comparisons between the MIMO capacity of Rayleigh matrix channels with independent elements and matrix channels constructed using this clustering model. We confirm, as intuition would expect, that in general clustering of rays leads to a decrease in capacity, due to increased spatial correlation across a MIMO array. In addition, we find that the MIMO channel capacity can also increase as the number of scatterers increases through scatterer redundancy or diversity. Further, we look at the growth of capacity with n the minimum of the number of antennas at TX and RX; for independent Rayleigh matrix channels this growth is known to be linear offering the possibility of unprecedented spectral efficiencies as n increases. However, taking published results at 7 GHz that suggest an angular spread /spl sigma/ /spl ap/ 25/spl deg/, we find that the growth of capacity with n, although no longer linear, is still significant compared to optimal RX diversity with maximal ratio combining.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Seminar on MIMO: Communications Systems from Concept to Implementations (Ref.

Perfect design of such systems requires profound knowledge of the radio channel, especially its time-variant characteristics in various radio environments. A precise characterization of the radio channel is given by the vector channel impulse response (VCIR). In multi input multiple output (MIMO) systems the VCIR is measured for each transmitting antenna to a configured RX antenna array. The time variance of the radio channel requires high speed recording of VCIR with respect to the maximum Doppler frequency. The presented vector channel sounder covers all MIMO aspects. Up to 256 MIMO channels can be configured by software. The broadband technique grants high time resolution. Superresolution techniques can be used for joint estimation of time delay, direction of arrival and direction of departure with respect to multipath propagation. The measurement data can be used directly (as stored radio channel) as well as indirectly (as derived channel model) for realistic link- and system-level simulation.","doi":"10.1049/ic:20010207","publicationTitle":"IEE Seminar on MIMO: Communications Systems from Concept to Implementations (Ref.

The algorithms are based on the MMSE detector and its BLAST versions. Comparisons are made using bit error ratio (BER) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) simulation. The system includes N transmitting antennas and M receiving antennas (N/spl les/M). The effects of coding and error propagation on algorithm performance are investigated for BPSK and 16-QAM modulation schemes. Simulations are carried out assuming firstly no coding at the transmitter and secondly repetition coding at the transmitter (delay diversity). If no coding is implemented, the performance of the MMSE detector can be improved by implementing its D-BLAST version and further improved by implementing its V-BLAST version. If repetition coding is used, the BER versus SNR performance of the MMSE detector is at least as good as that of its BLAST versions (due to BLAST error propagation effects). In general, for both modulation and coding schemes, the best performance is achieved by using repetition coding and the MMSE detector. The effect of error propagation in the BLAST schemes on BER depends on the choice of N, M, SNR modulation scheme and coding and can be significant.","doi":"10.1049/ic:20010209","publicationTitle":"IEE Seminar on MIMO: Communications Systems from Concept to Implementations (Ref.

An analytical modeling technique is developed to characterize an uncooperative two-level hierarchical caching system where the least recently used (LRU) algorithm is locally run at each cache. With this modeling technique, we are able to identify a characteristic time for each cache, which plays a fundamental role in understanding the caching processes. In particular, a cache can be viewed roughly as a low-pass filter with its cutoff frequency equal to the inverse of the characteristic time. Documents with access frequencies lower than this cutoff frequency have good chances to pass through the cache without cache hits. This viewpoint enables us to take any branch of the cache tree as a tandem of low-pass filters at different cutoff frequencies, which further results in the finding of two fundamental design principles. Finally, to demonstrate how to use the principles to guide the caching algorithm design, we propose a cooperative hierarchical Web caching architecture based on these principles. Both model-based and real trace simulation studies show that the proposed cooperative architecture results in more than 50% memory saving and substantial central processing unit (CPU) power saving for the management and update of cache entries compared with the traditional uncooperative hierarchical caching architecture.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2002.801752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/22158/01031903.pdf","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2002.801752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Web caching systems: modeling, design and experimental results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Web caching systems: modeling, design and experimental results","volume":"20","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7389655","htmlLink":"/document/1031903/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Web caching systems: modeling, design and experimental results","sourcePdf":"01031903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108781S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"22158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"253","xplore-issue":"22158","articleId":"1031903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1031906,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The high bandwidth requirements and the multi-timescale burstiness of compressed video make it a challenging problem to provision network resources for streaming multimedia. For such applications to become affordable and ubiquitous, it is necessary to develop scalable techniques to efficiently stream video to a large number of disparate clients across a heterogeneous Internet. In this paper, we propose to multicast smoothed video over an application-level overlay network of proxies, and to differentially cache the video at the intermediate nodes (proxies) in the distribution tree, in order to reduce the network bandwidth requirements of video dissemination. We formulate the multicast smoothing problem as an optimization problem, and develop an algorithm for computing the set of transmission schedules for the tree that minimize the peak rate and rate variability, given buffer constraints at different nodes in the tree. We also develop an algorithm to compute the minimum buffer allocation in the entire tree, such that feasible transmission to all the clients is possible, when the tree has heterogeneous rate constraints. We show through trace-driven simulations that substantial benefits are possible from multicast smoothing and differential caching, and that these gains can be realized even with modest proxy caches.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2002.802063","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/22158/01031906.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2002.802063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal multicast smoothing of streaming video over the Internet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Streaming media","Internet","Video compression","Bandwidth","Multicast algorithms","Multimedia communication","Computer aided instruction","Constraint optimization","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","Internet","cache storage","multicast communication","client-server systems","broadcasting","scheduling","visual communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multicast smoothing","streaming video","Internet","video broadcasts","corporate telecasts","distance learning","bandwidth requirements","multitimescale burstiness","compressed video","network resources","streaming multimedia","scalable techniques","application-level overlay network","proxies","video dissemination","optimization problem","transmission schedules","peak rate","rate variability","minimum buffer allocation","rate constraints","trace-driven simulations","caching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimal multicast smoothing of streaming video over the Internet","volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1031906/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7389658","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal multicast smoothing of streaming video over the Internet","sourcePdf":"01031906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100225S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"22158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"22158","articleId":"1031906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1031908,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Due to the scale and decentralized administration of the Internet, companies have a limited number of sites (relative to the size of the Internet) where they can place mirrors.

We study performance improvement in terms of client round-trip time (RTT) and server load when clients are clustered by the autonomous systems (AS) in which they reside. Our results show that, regardless of the mirror placement algorithm used, for only a surprisingly small range of values there is an increase in the number of mirror sites (under the constraint) effective in reducing the client to server RTT and server load. In this range, we show that greedy placement performs the best.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2002.802066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22158","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1382","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/22158/01031908.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2002.802066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained mirror placement on the Internet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mirrors","Internet","Web server","Engineering profession","Network servers","Telecommunication traffic","Clustering algorithms","Performance analysis","Laboratories","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","client-server systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained mirror placement","Internet","mirror placement problem","performance improvement","client round-trip time","server load"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Constrained mirror placement on the Internet","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1031908/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7389660","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained mirror placement on the Internet","sourcePdf":"01031908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080103S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"22158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"22158","articleId":"1031908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1031913,"authors":[{"name":"Hao-Chieh Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/22159/1031913/1031913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao-Chieh Chang was born in Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1972.

The real-time constraint of MPEG-4 shape coding leads to a heavy computational bottleneck on today's computer architectures. To overcome this problem, design analysis and optimization of MPEG-4 shape coding are addressed. By utilizing the RISC-based model, computational behaviors of the MPEG-4 shape coding tool are carefully examined and analyzed. The characteristic of a large amount of bit-level data processing and data transfer of MPEG-4 shape coding motivates the optimization of bit-level data operations. Applying data-flow optimization and data reuse techniques, bit-level computation-efficient architectures, such as data-dispatch-based binary-shaped motion estimation, the delay-line model, and configurable context-based arithmetic coding, are designed to accelerate bit-level processing. These hardware blocks are integrated and scheduled in a very efficient data flow to achieve real-time performance for MPEG-4 CPL2 (core profile level 2) specification at 23.5 MHz clock rate. The system architecture is implemented using Verilog HDL and synthesized with a 0.35 /spl mu/m four-layer CMOS standard library.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7393149","htmlLink":"/document/1031913/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture design of MPEG-4 shape coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture design of MPEG-4 shape coding","sourcePdf":"01031913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121011S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"22159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"22159","articleId":"1031913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1031916,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The video and image information is encoded nonhierarchically into multiple descriptions with the following objectives. The received picture quality should be acceptable, even if only one description is received and every additional received description contributes to enhanced picture quality. Typical applications will need a higher bandwidth/higher reliability connection than that provided by a single link in current mobile networks. To support these applications, a mobile node may need to set up and use multiple paths to the desired destination, either simply because of the lack of raw bandwidth on a single channel or because of its poor error characteristics, which reduce its effective throughput. The principal reason for considering such an architecture is to provide high bandwidth and more robust end-to-end connections. We describe a protocol architecture that addresses this need and, with the help of simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this system and compare the performance of the MDC-MPT scheme to a system using layered coding and asymmetrical paths for the base and enhancement layers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031916/","volume":"12","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1031916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7393152","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Supporting image and video applications in a multihop radio environment using path diversity and multiple description coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting image and video applications in a multihop radio environment using path diversity and multiple description coding","sourcePdf":"01031916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11007S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"22159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"22159","articleId":"1031916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1031918,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We address the special problems associated with pictures of variable but somehow parameterized quality such as MPEG-decoded video. Our algorithm provides a unified approach to restoration, chrominance upsampling, deinterlacing, and resolution enhancement. A decoded MPEG-2 sequence for interlaced standard definition television (SDTV) in 4:2:0 is converted to: (1) improved quality interlaced SDTV in 4:2:0; (2) interlaced SDTV in 4:4:4; (3) progressive SDTV in 4:4:4; (4) interlaced high-definition TV (HDTV) in 4:2:0; (5) progressive HDTV in 4:2:0. These conversions also provide features such as freeze frame and zoom. The algorithm is mainly targeted at bit rates of 4-8 Mb/s. The algorithm is based on motion-compensated spatial upsampling from multiple images and decimation to the desired format. The processing involves an estimated quality of individual pixels based on MPEG image type and local quantization value. The mean-squared error (MSE) is reduced, compared to the directly decoded sequence, and annoying ringing artifacts, including mosquito noise, are effectively suppressed. The superresolution pictures obtained by the algorithm are of much higher visual quality and have lower MSE than superresolution pictures obtained by simple spatial interpolation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031918/","volume":"12","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1031918/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7393154","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to restoration, deinterlacing and resolution enhancement in decoding MPEG-2 video","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to restoration, deinterlacing and resolution enhancement in decoding MPEG-2 video","sourcePdf":"01031918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051806S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"22159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"22159","articleId":"1031918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1031919,"authors":[{"name":"Jizheng Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jizheng Xu","id":"37279201100"},{"name":"Zixiang Xiong","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zixiang Xiong","id":"37278484800"},{"name":"Shipeng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Shipeng Li","id":"37279612900"},{"name":"Ya-Qin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Ya-Qin Zhang","id":"37279958300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"1031919","dbTime":"29 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) wavelet-based scalable video coding provides a viable alternative to standard MC-DCT coding.

However, there is no theoretical justification about its stopping criterion, which is based on the gap of the violation of the optimality condition. It is essential to have the gap asymptotically approach zero, so we are sure that existing implementations stop in a finite number of iterations after reaching a specified tolerance. Here, we prove this result and illustrate it by two extensions: /spl nu/-SVM and a multiclass SVM by Crammer and Singer (2001). A further result shows that, in final iterations of the decomposition method, only a particular set of variables are still being modified. This supports the use of the shrinking and caching techniques in some existing implementations. Finally, we prove the asymptotic convergence of a decomposition method for this multiclass SVM.

The first group is essentially fuzzy systems with self-tuning capabilities and requires an initial rule base to be specified prior to training. The second group of neural fuzzy networks, on the other hand, is able to automatically formulate the fuzzy rules from the numerical training data. No initial rule base needs to be specified prior to training. A cluster analysis is first performed on the training data and the fuzzy rules are subsequently derived through the proper connections of these computed clusters. However, most existing neural fuzzy systems (whether they belong to the first or second group) encountered one or more of the following major problems. They are (1) inconsistent rule-base; (2) heuristically defined node operations; (3) susceptibility to noisy training data and the stability-plasticity dilemma; and (4) needs for prior knowledge such as the number of clusters to be computed. Hence, a novel neural fuzzy system that is immune to the above-mentioned deficiencies is proposed in this paper. This new neural fuzzy system is named the generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN). The GenSoFNN network has strong noise tolerance capability by employing a new clustering technique known as discrete incremental clustering (DIC). The fuzzy rule base of the GenSoFNN network is consistent and compact as GenSoFNN has built-in mechanisms to identify and prune redundant and/or obsolete rules. Extensive simulations were conducted using the proposed GenSoFNN network and its performance is encouraging when benchmarked against other neural and neural fuzzy systems.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2002.1031940","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/22161/01031940.pdf","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1086","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2002.1031940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GenSoFNN: a generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"GenSoFNN: a generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7392973","pubMedId":"18244505","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1031940/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GenSoFNN: a generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network","sourcePdf":"01031940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087127S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"22161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"133","xplore-issue":"22161","articleId":"1031940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":1031941,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Chung Chu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/22161/1031941/1031941-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun-Chung Chu (S'88\u2013M'97) received the B.Sc. degree in electronics and M.Phil. degree in information engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 1990 and 1992, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control from University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K., in 1996.","From 1996 to 1997, he worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

While most of the previous research efforts were focused on the latter, this paper presents a method to compute an effective upper bound of the former for a class of discrete-time recurrent neural networks, which is not only applied to systems with arbitrary inputs but also extended to systems with small-norm inputs. The upper bound is computed by simple optimizations subject to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). To demonstrate the wide connections of our results to problems in control, the servomechanism is then studied, where a feedforward neural network is designed to control the output of a recurrent neural network to track a set of trajectories. This problem can be converted into the synthesis of feedforward-feedback gains such that the incremental gain of a certain system is minimized. An algorithm to perform such a synthesis is proposed and illustrated with a numerical example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7392974","pubMedId":"18244506","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1031941/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bounds of the incremental gain for discrete-time recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds of the incremental gain for discrete-time recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"01031941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105324S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"22161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"22161","articleId":"1031941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1031943,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Our phase-based approach proceeds in three stages. First, the image sequence is spatially filtered using a bank of quadrature pairs of Gabor filters, and the temporal phase gradient is computed, yielding estimates of the velocity component in directions orthogonal to the filter pairs' orientations. Second, a component velocity is rejected if the corresponding filter pair's phase information is not linear over a given time span. Third, the remaining component velocities at a single spatial location are combined and a recurrent neural network is used to derive the full velocity. We test our approach on several image sequences, both synthetic and realistic.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2002.1031944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22161","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1136","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/22161/01031944.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2002.1031944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A phase-based approach to the estimation of the optical flow field using spatial filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Phase estimation","Image motion analysis","Gabor filters","Image sequences","Robustness","Filter bank","Yield estimation","Information filtering","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sequences","filtering theory","recurrent neural nets","image motion analysis","computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-based approach","optical flow field estimation","spatial filtering","image sequences","lighting conditions","contour tracking","quadrature pairs","Gabor filters","temporal phase gradient","velocity component","phase information","recurrent neural network","aperture problem","image motion analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","displayDocTitle":"A phase-based approach to the estimation of the optical flow field using spatial filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1031944/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7392977","pubMedId":"18244509","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A phase-based approach to the estimation of the optical flow field using spatial filtering","sourcePdf":"01031944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069002S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"22161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"22161","articleId":"1031944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1031948,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the present study, we propose to choose RBF centers based on Fisher ratio class separability measure with the objective of achieving maximum discriminative power. We implement this idea using a multistep procedure that combines Fisher ratio, an orthogonal transform, and a forward selection search method. Our motivation of employing the orthogonal transform is to decouple the correlations among the responses of the hidden layer neurons so that the class separability provided by individual RBF neurons can be evaluated independently. The strengths of our method are double fold. First, our method selects a parsimonious network architecture.

By complete stability it is meant that each trajectory of the neural network converges toward an equilibrium point. The goal of this paper is to extend that method in order to address complete stability of the much wider class of symmetric neural networks with an additive interconnecting structure where the neuron activations are general PWL functions with an arbitrary number of straight segments. The main result obtained is that complete stability holds for any choice of the parameters within the class of symmetric additive neural networks with PWL neuron activations, i.e., such a class of neural networks enjoys the important property of absolute stability of global pattern formation. It is worth pointing out that complete stability is proved for generic situations where the neural network has finitely many (isolated) equilibrium points, as well as for degenerate situations where there are infinite (nonisolated) equilibrium points. The extension in this paper is of practical importance since it includes neural networks useful to solve significant signal processing tasks (e.g., neural networks with multilevel neuron activations). It is of theoretical interest too, due to the possibility of approximating any continuous function (e.g., a sigmoidal function), using PWL functions. The results in this paper confirm the advantages of the method of Forti and Tesi, with respect to LaSalle approach, to address complete stability of PWL neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2002.1031956","startPage":"1230","endPage":"1238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2002.1031956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/22161/01031956.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some extensions of a new method to analyze complete stability of neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031956/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Some extensions of a new method to analyze complete stability of neural networks","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1031956/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7392989","pubMedId":"18244521","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some extensions of a new method to analyze complete stability of neural networks","sourcePdf":"01031956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084818S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"22161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"22161","articleId":"1031956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":1031957,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The problem is formulated as a stochastic differential equation and is solved in the presence of circuit white noise sources yielding the spectrum of the PLL output. Specifically, the effect of loop filter characteristics, phase-frequency detector, and phase noise of the open-loop voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) on the PLL output spectrum is quantified. These results are derived using a full nonlinear analysis of the VCO in the feedback loop and cannot be predicted using traditional linear analyses or the phase noise analysis of open-loop oscillators. The computed spectrum matches well with measured results; specifically, the shape of the output spectrum matches very well with measured PLL output spectra reported in the literature for different kinds of loop filters and phase detectors. The PLL output spectrum computation only requires the phase noise of the VCO, loop filter and phase detector noise, phase detector gain, and loop filter transfer function and does not require the transient simulation of the entire PLL which can be very expensive. The noise analysis technique is illustrated with some examples.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2002.802347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/81/22162/01031966.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2002.802347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise analysis of phase-locked loops","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Noise analysis of phase-locked loops","volume":"49","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7393196","htmlLink":"/document/1031966/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise analysis of phase-locked loops","sourcePdf":"01031966.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097928S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"81","isNumber":"22162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"22162","articleId":"1031966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1031969,"authors":[{"name":"Sanqing Hu","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/81/22162/1031969/1031969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanqing Hu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, in 1992, the M.S.degree in automatic control from Northeastern University, Shengyang, China, in 1996, and the Ph.D. degree in automation and computer-aided engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2001.","He is currently a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago.

Aperture jitter analyses have been dealing up to now with white spectrum jitter. This assumption does not hold for the output of phase-locked loops (PLL)-like frequency synthesizers, where the spectrum is shaped by the loop transfer function. Based on a linear approximation, a powerful expression for the SNR is derived, applicable to a jitter process with a generic autocorrelation function and generic input signal. A lot of different definitions of jitter are available in the literature; this work addresses also the problem of identifying correctly among them the \"effective\" jitter for a given SNR. This can be profitably used in the specification as well as verification of the jitter requirements of a frequency synthesizer used as sampling clock generator in the AD converter systems. The results have been checked through numerical simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2002.802353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2002.802353","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/81/22162/01031971.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the jitter requirements of the sampling clock for analog-to-digital converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1031971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"On the jitter requirements of the sampling clock for analog-to-digital converters","volume":"49","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7393201","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1031971/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the jitter requirements of the sampling clock for analog-to-digital converters","sourcePdf":"01031971.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061038S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"81","isNumber":"22162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"22162","articleId":"1031971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1031980,"authors":[{"name":"R.C.

The transmitter chain is discussed before the channel model used is introduced. The receiver design approach is then discussed. Special consideration is given to show how channel estimation is integrated into the receiver. We show single cell performance results that indicate a capacity increase of approximately three times over the \"conventional\" receiver implementation is possible (with and without antenna arrays). Results are then shown using a cell dimensioning simulation tool to indicate the overall gain in terms of increase in cell size. Here we can show that a gain of approximately 50% of the cell size is possible with such a multi-user detection approach. The dimensioning tool is also used to show the increase in capacity for a fixed cell size.

One of the key challenges for the AMC scheme is the selection of the AMC switching levels. This is a challenging issue due to dissimilar sensitivity of the modulation schemes to Doppler velocity or multipath channel impairment. Furthermore, given the wide range of receiver and transmitter technologies, a scheme is required that adaptively estimates the optimal switching point which will maximize the system throughput. We present an adaptive mechanism utilizing the fast hybrid ARQ feedback signal that is available in R5 of the UMTS system. Conceptually, the proposed threshold adjustment algorithm (TAA) is somewhat similar to the outer loop power control scheme that is already adopted in R99. The switching level is adjusted in such a way that the link performance, in terms of block error rate, maintains a target value. Performance of the proposed scheme is also demonstrated using a link level simulation.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20020380","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/8025/22164/01032014.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20020380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive modulation switching level control in high speed downlink packet access transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 May 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032014/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive modulation switching level control in high speed downlink packet access transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7625884","conferenceDate":"8-10 May 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive modulation switching level control in high speed downlink packet access transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1032014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040659S","chronDate":"8-10 May 2002","isNumber":"22164","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1032014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":1032017,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Simulation results show improvements in detection using a longer preamble with differential accumulation. For a longer preamble, coherent processing suffers large losses in the presence of Doppler. Efficient channel estimation algorithms and pre-Doppler compensation are required if a coherent approach is used. The reduced sensitivity of coherent detection in the presence of Doppler could be compensated by adopting a differential approach even though this solution increases the complexity at the receiver. It can be seen that the modified ETSI proposal does not degrade the performance compared to the ETSI proposal in terms of detection probability. Hence, we can expect improvements in the RACH throughput efficiency and delay since there are more available signatures and so the probability that more than one user chooses the same signature that results in collision is lower. Also, to achieve a one-shot-acquisition for the random access burst, the performance of preamble detection and message detection must be aligned, i.e. at an E/sub c//N/sub 0/, where the preamble detection is likely, the RACH message BLER (block error rate) must be adequately low. The alignment is done by adjusting the preamble detection performance setting the threshold of the received energy of the matched filter at the receiver. From the simulation results, it was shown that with the used threshold, the probability of detection corresponds to more than 0.9 at the required E/sub b//N/sub 0/ for a BLER of 10/sup -1/ for the message part.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-level simulation of W-CDMA satellite-UMTS random access channel","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","doi":"10.1049/cp:20020383","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/8025/22164/01032017.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20020383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 May 2002","displayDocTitle":"Link-level simulation of W-CDMA satellite-UMTS random access channel","conferenceDate":"8-10 May 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7625887","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link-level simulation of W-CDMA satellite-UMTS random access channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1032017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106431S","chronDate":"8-10 May 2002","isNumber":"22164","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1032017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1032031,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Prior to this deployment, a dimensioning and planning stage is necessary to assess the radio access network coverage and capacity. A critical downlink issue of radio capacity and coverage planning is the power allocation required per user to fulfil network GoS requirements. Indeed, each Node B within a WCDMA system has a finite power resource that has to be shared amongst a number of users, or more accurately links elements (including users in soft handover). The consequent capacity of a 3G cellular system is dependant on the adequate resource sharing of the Node B transmit power. Three fundamental parameters describe this power: 1. The total transmit power 2. The pilot power 3. The allocated transmit power per dedicated traffic channel (DCH). This paper discusses the impact of these tuneable parameters on capacity, coverage, QoS and consequently GoS in a WCDMA network.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20020398","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/8025/22164/01032032.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20020398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink transmit power issues in a WCDMA cellular system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 May 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032032/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink transmit power issues in a WCDMA cellular system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7625902","conferenceDate":"8-10 May 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink transmit power issues in a WCDMA cellular system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1032032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026024S","chronDate":"8-10 May 2002","isNumber":"22164","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1032032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032036,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

GSM standard shows that most of the security features were designed from an operator perspective with a view to preventing fraud and network misuse; the responsibility for implementing features related to user's privacy was delegated to the operators. This approach failed in providing a trusted environment where mobile users felt confident enough to place commercial transactions and exchange sensitive information. As technology matures and mobile data services appear, users are more than ever questioning the security of mobile communications and are becoming more aware of the associated risks. This is particularly true in the area of m-banking, where bank establishments have been reluctant to introduce sophisticated services and users uncomfortable to use their mobile telephones to transmit sensitive information about their accounts. Aware of the need to boost public confidence in mobile data services, the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) committee in charge of developing the standards for the Universal Mobile Telephony System (UMTS), took a different approach and incorporated more security requirements into the specification. This article looks at the security aspects associated with mobile communications and the way risks are addressed both in GSM and UMTS.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20020410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20020410","startPage":"308","endPage":"311","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/8025/22164/01032044.pdf","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on 3G Mobile Communication Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From 2G to 3G: a guide to mobile security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 May 2002","displayDocTitle":"From 2G to 3G: a guide to mobile security","conferenceDate":"8-10 May 2002","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"7625914","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032044/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From 2G to 3G: a guide to mobile security","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1032044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03434S","chronDate":"8-10 May 2002","isNumber":"22164","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8025","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1032044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1032052,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Our work is based on the downlink time difference of arrival (TDOA) positioning technique proposed for the LoCating Services (LCS) in GSM and wideband CDMA. We also study the effect of the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) link between the BS and mobile terminal (MT) on the accuracy of the estimated position.

Such flashover leads to system outages. Near the coastal areas the salt contamination can be rapidly built on the surface of the insulators and form a conducting layer by absorbing wet from the mist. This layer in some cases leads to flashover. Study of contamination of insulator under marine pollution is the aim of this research and the effects of various meteorological factors on the pollution severity have been investigated thoroughly. In the present paper an attempt has been made to estimate the pollution severity under various weather conditions during the rainy season using an artificial neural network. The outlier selection problem has been considered in this work to eliminate few highly dispersed experimental data. The relationship between ESDD with temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall and wind velocity has been developed using ANN as a function estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 April 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032187/","accessionNumber":"7314383","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 April 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of salt contamination level on the high voltage insulators surfaces during rainy season using artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of salt contamination level on the high voltage insulators surfaces during rainy season using artificial neural network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1032187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035671S","chronDate":"17-19 April 2002","isNumber":"22165","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8026","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1032187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1032235,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The method exploits the built-in capacitance of an electrowetting device to meter the droplet volume and control the dispensing process dynamically. A fully automated droplet dispensing device is developed and used to load liquid samples or couple continuous flow to electro-wetting droplet handling. The reproducibility of the dispensing process is tested against dispensing parameters including dispensing volume, production rate, fluid viscosity, channel geometry and needle diameter. The relative independence of the reproducibility on those parameters indicates the wide applicability of the device in biological and chemical sample dispensing. Meanwhile, as low as 1.2% error in reproducibility is demonstrated and up to 120 droplets per minute production rate is possible. The dispensing process has been demonstrated for droplet volumes between 60 nl and 1900 nl or above while maintain reproducibility in an acceptable range of 10%.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/8027/22166/01032267.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/NANO.2002.1032267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANO.2002.1032267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22166","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micro/nano liter droplet formation and dispensing by capacitance metering and electrowetting actuation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance","Reproducibility of results","Production","Automatic control","Fluid flow control","Process control","Testing","Viscosity","Geometry","Needles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drops","capacitance","wetting","viscosity","metering","actuators","microsensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microliter droplet formation","nanoliter droplet formation","capacitance metering","electrowetting actuation","electrowetting","droplet volume","fully automated droplet dispensing","production rate","fluid viscosity","channel geometry","needle diameter","reproducibility","sample handling techniques","lab-on-a-chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Micro/nano liter droplet formation and dispensing by capacitance metering and electrowetting actuation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1032267/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7509714","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"28-28 Aug. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micro/nano liter droplet formation and dispensing by capacitance metering and electrowetting actuation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"1032267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05173S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8027","isNumber":"22166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8027","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"22166","articleId":"1032267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032285,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Specifically, the haptic perception of detail is characterized by identification, detection, and discrimination of round and square cross-section ridges, in addition to corner detection tests. Test results indicate that performance, measured as a percent correct score in the perception experiments, improves in a nonlinear fashion as the maximum allowable level of force in the simulation increases. Further, all test subjects appeared to reach a limit in their perception capabilities at maximum-force output levels of 3-4 N, while the hardware was capable of 10 N of maximum continuous force output. These results indicate that haptic interface hardware may be able to convey sufficient perceptual information to the user with relatively low levels of force feedback. The data is compiled to aid those who wish to design a stylus-type haptic interface to meet certain requirements for the display of physical detail within a haptic simulation.","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2002.802725","startPage":"280","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/22174/01032409.pdf","endPage":"288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2002.802725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032409/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of force saturation on the haptic perception of detail","volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1032409/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7389580","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of force saturation on the haptic perception of detail","sourcePdf":"01032409.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044683S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"22174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"22174","articleId":"1032409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032411,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Conventional approaches to contouring control suffer from the complicated contour-error model and from lack of a systematic way for controller design. The integrated controller is based on polar coordinates under which a relatively simple contour-error model can be obtained. Taking the simple contour error as a state variable, the contouring-control problem is transformed into a stabilization problem. The feedback-linearization technique incorporated with linear feedback or robust control (such as sliding-mode control) can then yield the integrated controller.

However, in some industrial applications where the signal period varies but other requirements force a fixed sample rate, the number of samples per period may be a non-integer. To address this problem, this paper presents a new adaptive repetitive control, which deals with the non-integer samples per period due to the fixed sampling rate. The proposed adaptive repetitive control consists of two portions, the repetitive controller and nominal controller, where the former uses a fictitious sampler operating at a variable sample rate maintained at multiple times of the signal frequency, while the latter uses a fixed sampling rate. Interpolations are utilized to generate the fictitious samples required for the repetitive learning. The nearly perfect tracking was achieved for non-integer samples per period, when a simple linear interpolation is used. The error due to the interpolation is quantified, which is negligible to the residual tracking error. The comparison of the proposed and the existing schemes shows the significant improvement on the tracking performance. The experimental results on the control of a servomotor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2002.802730","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/22174/01032418.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"384","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2002.802730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive repetitive control to track variable periodic signals with fixed sampling rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive repetitive control to track variable periodic signals with fixed sampling rate","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1032418/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7389589","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive repetitive control to track variable periodic signals with fixed sampling rate","sourcePdf":"01032418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052812S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"22174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"22174","articleId":"1032418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1032427,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The current in the branch capacitor is extracted from Kirchhoffs current law. This provides a good model of the branch capacitor and does not require companion models during simulation. The proposed model has been verified with SPICE through a simple example. The on-chip power grid simulation, the characteristics of noise propagation and the effectiveness of on-chip decoupling capacitors have been discussed.

The evolution of device technology has yielded devices with clock rates in the GHz range and rise and fall times in the order of a few pico seconds. Without a proper design, ICs often generate high radiated and conducted emissions. The customer can no longer assume that the system in which modern ICs are implemented will meet the regulatory limits and performance compatibility with other electronic devices. This paper deals with the characterization of the electromagnetic emission of ICs, especially the so-called 1 /spl Omega//150 /spl Omega/ method (IEC 61967-4) will be used to measure the conducted emission of an EMC test chip. In particular, the problem of this method when applied to measure the emission of a slew rate controlled output driver is discussed. Higher emission results caused by the 150 /spl Omega/ coupling network (which is not present in conventional applications) have been experimentally evaluated by simulations and measurements.","doi":"10.1109/ISEMC.2002.1032513","publicationTitle":"2002 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"2002 IEEE International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/8028/22167/01032513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISEMC.2002.1032513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22167","startPage":"407","endPage":"412 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring the electromagnetic emissions of integrated circuits with IEC 61967-4 (the measuring method and its weaknesses)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measuring the electromagnetic emissions of integrated circuits with IEC 61967-4 (the measuring method and its weaknesses)","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Aug. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032513/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 Aug. 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7501283","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1032513/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring the electromagnetic emissions of integrated circuits with IEC 61967-4 (the measuring method and its weaknesses)","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"1032513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115094S","chronDate":"19-23 Aug. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8028","isNumber":"22167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8028","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"22167","articleId":"1032513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032583,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, while a network of workstations may be readily available, these workstations may be privately owned and the owners may not want others to interrupt their priority in using the computer. Assuming machine owners have a preemptive priority, in this paper, we study the parallel processing capacity of a privately owned network of workstations. A mathematical model is developed to predict performance for nondedicated network computing. It also considers systems with heterogeneous machine utilization and heterogeneous service distribution. This model separates the influence of machine utilization, sequential job service rate, and parallel task allocation on the parallel completion time. It is simple and valuable for guiding task scheduling in a nondedicated environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/22177/01032624.pdf","startPage":"1041","endPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2002.1032624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2002.1032624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance modeling and prediction of nondedicated network computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Computer networks","Workstations","Distributed computing","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Pervasive computing","High performance computing","Costs","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workstation clusters","performance evaluation","parallel processing","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workstation networks","preemptive priority","parallel processing capacity","privately owned network","nondedicated network computing","heterogeneous machine utilization","heterogeneous service distribution","sequential job service rate","parallel task allocation","task scheduling","workload distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Performance modeling and prediction of nondedicated network computing","volume":"51","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1032624/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7382948","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance modeling and prediction of nondedicated network computing","sourcePdf":"01032624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054904S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"22177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"22177","articleId":"1032624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032635,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

To achieve a high dielectric constant, bimodal ceramic particle distributions, along with particles modified by a surfactant and mixed ultrasonically with the polymer have been explored. This paper presents a statistically designed experiment for systematic characterization of the dielectric constant and loss tangent of integral capacitors formed in this manner by using barium titanate particles in an epoxy polymer dielectric. We determine these quantities as a function of the particle size of the ceramic, the volume fraction of ceramic in the polymer matrix, the polymer cure time, the polymer cure temperature, the percent of surfactant, the ultrasonic mixing time, and the ball milling time for ceramic surface modification. These factors are examined by means of a partial factorial experiment requiring 32 runs. Further experimentation is performed to generate sufficient data for process modeling. To develop such models, we train neural networks to model the variation as a function of input variables using the experimental data. These models are then used for process optimization using genetic algorithms. Using this methodology, we determine the proper combination of polymer/ceramic materials and process conditions to achieve desirable electrical properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032737/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7492487","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1032737/","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"17-18 July 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of nanocomposite integral capacitor fabrication using neural networks and genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of nanocomposite integral capacitor fabrication using neural networks and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1032737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089547S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8031","isNumber":"22178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8031","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"22178","articleId":"1032737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1032798,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Higher level understanding of events requires that certain lower level computer vision tasks be performed. These may include detection of unusual motion, tracking targets, labeling body parts, and understanding the interactions between people. To achieve many of these tasks, it is necessary to build representations of the appearance of objects in the scene. This paper focuses on two issues related to this problem. First, we construct a statistical representation of the scene background that supports sensitive detection of moving objects in the scene, but is robust to clutter arising out of natural scene variations. Second, we build statistical representations of the foreground regions (moving objects) that support their tracking and support occlusion reasoning. The probability density functions (pdfs) associated with the background and foreground are likely to vary from image to image and will not in general have a known parametric form. We accordingly utilize general nonparametric kernel density estimation techniques for building these statistical representations of the background and the foreground. These techniques estimate the pdf directly from the data without any assumptions about the underlying distributions. Example results from applications are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2002","publicationDate":"July 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1032799/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7402146","volume":"90","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Background and foreground modeling using nonparametric kernel density estimation for visual surveillance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Background and foreground modeling using nonparametric kernel density estimation for visual surveillance","sourcePdf":"01032799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09052S","chronDate":"July  2002","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"22179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1025","xplore-issue":"22179","articleId":"1032799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032803,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The ability to customize the architecture to match the computation and the data flow of the application has demonstrated significant performance benefits compared to general purpose architectures. Computer vision applications are one class of applications that have significant heterogeneity in their computation and communication structures. At the low level, vision algorithms have regular repetitive computations operating on large sets of image data with predictable data dependencies. At the higher level, the computations have irregular dependencies. Computer vision application characteristics have significant overlap with the advantages of reconfigurable architectures. The main focus of the paper is on outlining the methodologies required to realize the potential of reconfigurable architectures for vision applications. After giving a broad introduction to reconfigurable computing, the advantages of utilizing reconfigurable architectures for vision applications are outlined and illustrated using example computations. The paper discusses the development of fundamental configurable computing models that abstract the underlying hardware for high-level application mapping. The Hybrid System Architecture Model and algorithms utilizing the model are illustrated to demonstrate a formal framework. The paper also outlines ongoing research and provides a comprehensive list of references for further reading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032803/","volume":"90","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1032803/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7402150","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable computing systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable computing systems","sourcePdf":"01032803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092025S","chronDate":"July  2002","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"22179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"22179","articleId":"1032803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032806,"authors":[{"name":"T.

IHCI emphasizes that human behavior encompasses both apparent human behavior and the hidden mental state behind behavioral performance. IHCI expands on the interpretation of human activities, known as W4 (what, where, when, who). While W4 only addresses the apparent perceptual aspect of human behavior the W5+ technology for IHCI described in this paper addresses also the why and how questions, whose solution requires recognizing specific cognitive states. IHCI integrates parsing and interpretation of nonverbal information with a computational cognitive model of the user which, in turn, feeds into processes that adapt the interface to enhance operator performance and provide for rational decision-making. The technology proposed is based on a general four-stage interactive framework, which moves from parsing the raw sensory-motor input, to interpreting the user's motions and emotions, to building an understanding of the user's current cognitive state. It then diagnoses various problems in the situation and adapts the interface appropriately. The interactive component of the system improves processing at each stage. Examples of perceptual, behavioral, and cognitive tools are described throughout the paper Adaptive and intelligent HCI are important for novel applications of computing, including ubiquitous and human-centered computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032808/","volume":"90","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1032808/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7402155","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integrating perceptual and cognitive modeling for adaptive and intelligent human-computer interaction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating perceptual and cognitive modeling for adaptive and intelligent human-computer interaction","sourcePdf":"01032808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116286S","chronDate":"July  2002","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"22179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"22179","articleId":"1032808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1032835,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In wireless communications, it is related to the system characteristics such as handoff, outage probability, fading rate, average duration of fades, velocity (or maximum Doppler shift) of the mobile, and the effect of diversity on fading. The LCR formula was originally derived by Rice in terms of the joint probability density function (pdf) of the underlying process and its time derivative. In this letter, we express the LCR in terms of the joint characteristic function (cf). This new formula is useful for many cases where the joint cf is simpler to derive than the associated joint pdf. As an application and for a direct-sequence code-division multiple-access system, the fading rate at the output of a RAKE receiver with either maximal ratio combiner or postdetection equal gain combiner, operating over a frequency-selective fading channel with different path statistics, is easily calculated using the new cf-based LCR formula.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01032998.pdf","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1032998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Level crossing rate in terms of the characteristic function: a new approach for calculating the fading rate in diversity systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity methods","Diversity reception","Random processes","Multiaccess communication","Multipath channels","Frequency-selective fading channels","RAKE receivers","Cultural differences","Probability density function","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","diversity reception","radio receivers","mobile radio","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["level crossing rate","fading rate","diversity systems","LCR","random process","handoff","outage probability","fade duration","velocity","maximum Doppler shift","mobile radio","joint characteristic function","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access system","RAKE receiver","maximal ratio combiner","postdetection equal gain combiner","frequency-selective fading channel","path statistics","DS-CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1032998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Level crossing rate in terms of the characteristic function: a new approach for calculating the fading rate in diversity systems","volume":"50","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1032998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399443","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Level crossing rate in terms of the characteristic function: a new approach for calculating the fading rate in diversity systems","sourcePdf":"01032998.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048054S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1032998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033000,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

In particular, orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and filtered multitone (FMT) systems are two examples where the modulation filter has an ideal rectangular amplitude characteristic in time and frequency domains, respectively. In this letter, we propose new equalization schemes for FMT and compare their performances with OFDM. In general, FMT has a greater spectral efficiency than OFDM, due to the absence of the cyclic prefix and a reduced number of virtual carriers. However, it exhibits a higher distortion per subchannel, due to the imperfect equalization of the transmit filters. As a performance comparison, we considered both the achievable bit rate (ABR) and the bit error rate (BER) in a multipath Rayleigh fading channel. We note that while ABR gives a theoretical bound on the system bit rate, assuming the knowledge of the channel at the transmit side, the BER refers to an uncoiled system with a fixed modulation. Although FMT requires a fixed structure with a higher computational complexity than OFDM, it turns out that FMT, even with the simplest one tap per subchannel adaptive equalizer, yields a better performance than OFDM, both in terms of ABR and BER. Hence, FMT can be a valid alternative to OFDM for broadband wireless applications, also.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization methods in OFDM and FMT systems for broadband wireless communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802571","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01033002.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033002/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Equalization methods in OFDM and FMT systems for broadband wireless communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1033002/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399447","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization methods in OFDM and FMT systems for broadband wireless communications","sourcePdf":"01033002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077134S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1033002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033003,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan-Jung Su","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Hsuan-Jung Su","id":"37280809100"},{"name":"E.

Although the same in concept, this work differs from the conventional minimum mean-squared error method in that there is more than one desired signal dimension each corresponding to one of the space-time coded streams. It is shown that the number of linear filters required by the maximum SNR array processor is no more than the dimension of the signal space or the number of collaborating transmit antennas.

It is shown that the proposed scheme offers high power efficiency exploiting both space and time diversity, while the computational complexity is kept at a relatively low level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-interleaved coded differential space-time modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01033005.pdf","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Bit-interleaved coded differential space-time modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1033005/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399450","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-interleaved coded differential space-time modulation","sourcePdf":"01033005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141319S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1033005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033006,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

Implemented with analog components, the continuous-time impulse radio multiple-access model utilizes pulse-position modulation and random time-hopping codes to alleviate multipath effects and suppress multiuser interference. We introduce a novel continuous-time impulse radio transmitter model and deduce from it an approximate one with lower complexity. We also develop a time-division duplex access protocol along with orthogonal user codes to enable impulse radio as a radio link for wireless cellular systems. Relying on this protocol, we then derive a multiple-input/multiple-output equivalent model for full continuous-time model and a single-input/single-output model, for the approximate one. Based on these models, we finally develop design composite linear/nonlinear receivers for the downlink. The linear step eliminates multiuser interference deterministically and accounts for frequency-selective multipath while a maximum-likelihood receiver performs symbol detection. Simulations are provided to compare performance of the different receivers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01033006.pdf","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-digital impulse radio with multiuser detection for wireless cellular systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Wireless cellular systems","Pulse modulation","Access protocols","Ultra wideband technology","Baseband","Multimedia systems","Wireless communication","Modulation coding","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","multiuser channels","maximum likelihood detection","cellular radio","digital radio","broadband networks","radio transmitters","time division multiplexing","access protocols","codes","MIMO systems","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-digital impulse radio","multiuser detection","wireless cellular systems","ultrawideband system","baseband asynchronous multiple-access","multimedia services","tactical wireless","continuous-time impulse radio transmitter model","complexity","time-division duplex access protocol","orthogonal user codes","multiple-input/multiple-output equivalent model","full continuous-time model","single-input/single-output model","design composite linear/nonlinear receivers","downlink","linear step","multiuser interference","frequency-selective multipath","maximum-likelihood receiver","symbol detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"All-digital impulse radio with multiuser detection for wireless cellular systems","volume":"50","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1033006/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399451","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-digital impulse radio with multiuser detection for wireless cellular systems","sourcePdf":"01033006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074319S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1033006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1033007,"authors":[{"name":"H.

They coined the names \"autocoding\" for this phenomenon and \"autocapacity\" for C/sub a/. They also proposed a signalling scheme based on random unitary matrices that achieves a significant fraction of this capacity. The main limitation, however, is that currently no decoder of reasonable complexity is known for this signalling scheme. We investigate the application of space-time layering to autocoding. We show that properly constructed layered systems can achieve the autocapacity with a reasonable complexity receiver composed of minimum mean-square error (MMSE) decision feedback multiuser detectors and single user decoders. In addition to this asymptotic result, we propose a specific layering approach, the threaded space-time layering, that combines generalized bit interleaved space-time coded modulation, iterative signal processing and pilot symbol assisted channel estimation. We show that this approach is well suited for practical systems with limited numbers of transmit antennas and small coherence intervals. Finally, we report simulation results that demonstrate the ability of the threaded approach to achieve significant fractions of the autocapacity with a realizable receiver. The simulation results also indicate significant performance gains over the Cayley differential space-time signalling scheme in certain scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01033007.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of layered space-time systems for autocoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033007/","displayDocTitle":"On the design of layered space-time systems for autocoding","volume":"50","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399452","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033007/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of layered space-time systems for autocoding","sourcePdf":"01033007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080544S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1033007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1033009,"authors":[{"name":"Y.G.

In this paper, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for MIMO channels (MIMO-OFDM) is considered for wideband transmission to mitigate intersymbol interference and enhance system capacity. The MIMO-OFDM system uses two independent space-time codes for two sets of two transmit antennas. At the receiver, the independent space-time codes are decoded using prewhitening, followed by minimum-Euclidean-distance decoding based on successive interference cancellation. Computer simulation shows that for four-input and four-output systems transmitting data at 4 Mb/s over a 1.25 MHz channel, the required signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for 10% and 1% word error rates (WER) are 10.5 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively, when each codeword contains 500 information bits and the channel's Doppler frequency is 40 Hz (corresponding normalized frequency: 0.9%). Increasing the number of the receive antennas improves the system performance. When the number or receive antennas is increased from four to eight, the required SNRs for 10% and 1% WER are reduced to 4 dB and 6 dB, respectively. Therefore, MIMO-OFDM is a promising technique for highly spectrally efficient wideband transmission.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01033009.pdf","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM for wireless communications: signal detection with enhanced channel estimation","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM for wireless communications: signal detection with enhanced channel estimation","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399454","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"50","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1033009/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM for wireless communications: signal detection with enhanced channel estimation","sourcePdf":"01033009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053918S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"370","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1033009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033010,"authors":[{"name":"F.

There is no bandwidth expansion, so K users occupy the same bandwidth as one single user. The load of the system, in number of bits per channel use, is therefore much higher than the load in, for example, conventional code-division multiple-access systems. Interleavers are introduced as a new feature to separate the users. This implies that the maximum-likelihood sequence detector (MLSD) is now too complex to implement. Iterative detectors are therefore suggested as an alternative to the joint MLSD. The conventional interference cancellation (IC), detector has lower complexity than the MLSD, but its performance is shown to be far from acceptable. Even after a novel improvement of the IC detector, the performance is unsatisfactory. Instead of using IC, another iterative detector is suggested. This detector updates the branch metric for every iteration, and avoids the standard Gaussian approximation. Simulations show that the performance of this detector can be close to single-user performance, even when the interleaver and the phase offset are the only user-specific features in the TCMA system.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/22183/01033010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2002.802563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22183","startPage":"1478","endPage":"1485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative detectors for trellis-code multiple-access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative detectors for trellis-code multiple-access","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7399455","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033010/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative detectors for trellis-code multiple-access","sourcePdf":"01033010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080737S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"22183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"22183","articleId":"1033010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033012,"authors":[{"name":"K.

PICO research takes a systematic approach to the hierarchical design of complex systems and advances technologies for automatically designing custom nonprogrammable accelerators and VLIW processors. While skeptics often assume that automated design must emulate human designers who invent new solutions to problems, PICO's approach is to automatically pick the most suitable designs from a well-engineered space of designs. Such automation of embedded computer design promises an era of yet more growth in the number and variety of innovative smart products by lowering the barriers of design time, designer availability, and design cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["VLIW","Costs","Embedded computing","Design automation","Space exploration","Hardware","Design optimization","Computer applications","Design methodology","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["special purpose computers","embedded systems","application specific integrated circuits","parallel machines","parallel architectures","logic CAD","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PICO project","program in chip out project","HP Labs research","application-specific computing systems","cost-effective design","custom chips","off-the-shelf design","custom nonprogrammable accelerators","VLIW processors","embedded computer design","design cost","automatic custom computer design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033026","doi":"10.1109/MC.2002.1033026","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/22184/01033026.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2002.1033026","startPage":"39","endPage":"47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22184","publicationTitle":"Computer","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PICO: automatically designing custom computers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PICO: automatically designing custom computers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033026/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","volume":"35","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1033026/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7405585","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PICO: automatically designing custom computers","sourcePdf":"01033026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056648S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"22184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"22184","articleId":"1033026","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033027,"authors":[{"name":"W.

While today's digital cameras capture images, smart cameras capture high-level descriptions of the scene and analyze what they see. These devices could support a wide variety of applications including human and animal detection, surveillance, motion analysis, and facial identification. Video processing has an insatiable demand for real-time performance. Smart cameras leverage very large-scale integration to meet this need in a low-cost, low-power system with substantial memory. Moving well beyond pixel processing and compression, these VLSI systems run a wide range of algorithms to extract meaning from streaming video. Recently, Princeton University researchers developed a first-generation smart camera system that can detect people and analyze their movement in real time. Because they push the design space in so many dimensions, these smart cameras are a leading-edge application for embedded system research.","doi":"10.1109/MC.2002.1033027","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/22184/01033027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2002.1033027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22184","startPage":"48","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart cameras as embedded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart cameras as embedded systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7405586","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033027/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart cameras as embedded systems","sourcePdf":"01033027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105615S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"2","isNumber":"22184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"22184","articleId":"1033027","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033081,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Yoot Khuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, MARA University of Technology, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Lee Yoot Khuan","id":"37087264859"},{"name":"N.

A comparative analysis of the DC motor drive's behavior with and without ANN based was performed. It is shown that rotor speed feedback by suitably trained ANN enables very good quality of the drive performance over a wide range operating conditions for both open and close loop systems. For the purpose of the training, the Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithm was used. A standard three layer feed-forward neural network with tan-sigmoid (tansig) activation functions in hidden layer and purelin at the output layer was applied in this design. The result shows that by using only one hidden layer, minimum error can be obtained and the performance of the estimator is excellent. The proposed solution seems to be attractive to the conventional speed estimator, resulting a mechanically simpler motor and consequently increasing the degree of reliability for the whole drive systems.","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033083","pdfPath":"/iel5/8033/22185/01033083.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"Student Conference on Research and Development","publicationTitle":"Student Conference on Research and Development","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of artificial neural network (ANN) based rotor speed estimator for DC drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Design of artificial neural network (ANN) based rotor speed estimator for DC drive","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7502645","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033083/","conferenceDate":"17-17 July 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of artificial neural network (ANN) based rotor speed estimator for DC drive","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1033083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046508S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8033","isNumber":"22185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22185","articleId":"1033083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1033108,"authors":[{"name":"I.

With the increase in power demand and limited power sources has caused the system to operate at its maximum capacity. Therefore, a study that is able to determine the maximum capacity limit before voltage collapse must be carried out so that necessary precaution can be taken to avoid system capacity violation. This paper presents a novel fast voltage stability index (FVSI) simplified from a pre-developed voltage stability index referred to a line initiated from the voltage quadratic equation at the sending end of a representation of a 2-bus system. The line index in the interconnected system in which the value that is closed to 1.00 indicates that the line has reached its instability limit which could cause sudden voltage drop to the corresponding bus caused by the reactive load variation. The formulated index was tested on the IEEE reliability test system in order to verify the performance of the proposed indicator. Results showed that the proposed technique is indicative in predicting the occurrence of system collapse and hence necessary action can be taken to avoid such incident.","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033108","pdfPath":"/iel5/8033/22185/01033108.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"268","displayPublicationTitle":"Student Conference on Research and Development","publicationTitle":"Student Conference on Research and Development","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel fast voltage stability index (FVSI) for voltage stability analysis in power transmission system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Novel fast voltage stability index (FVSI) for voltage stability analysis in power transmission system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7492560","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033108/","conferenceDate":"17-17 July 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel fast voltage stability index (FVSI) for voltage stability analysis in power transmission system","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1033108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058989S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8033","isNumber":"22185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8033","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"22185","articleId":"1033108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1033122,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The two-stage training procedure adapted in numerous RBFNN applications usually provides satisfactory network performance. Though this method is proven to allow faster training and improves convergence, the initial stage of selecting the network centers pose a problem of creating a larger architecture than what is required.

Orthogonal least squares and input clustering are two of such methods that show considerable results of which can provide an amicable solution to the above problem. This paper presents a comparative study on the performance achieved by the two techniques demonstrated when applying the RBFNN in modeling of nonlinear functions and an investigation based on their capabilities in handling over-parameterization problems.","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033124","startPage":"326","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"Student Conference on Research and Development","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2002.1033124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22185","displayPublicationTitle":"Student Conference on Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/8033/22185/01033124.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear function approximation using radial basis function neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033124/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear function approximation using radial basis function neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033124/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7502665","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 July 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear function approximation using radial basis function neural networks","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1033124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048046S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8033","isNumber":"22185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8033","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"22185","articleId":"1033124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1033142,"authors":[{"name":"W.S.K.M.

The hybrid adaptive FNN controller, the free parameters of which can be tuned on-line by an observer-based output feedback control law and adaptive law, is a combination of direct and indirect adaptive FNN controllers. A weighting factor, which can be adjusted by the tradeoff between plant knowledge and control knowledge, is adopted to sum together the control efforts from indirect adaptive FNN controller and direct adaptive FNN controller. Furthermore, a supervisory controller is appended into the FNN controller to force the state to be within the constraint set. Therefore, if the FNN controller cannot maintain the stability, the supervisory controller starts working to guarantee stability. On the other hand, if the FNN controller works well, the supervisory controller will be deactivated. The overall adaptive scheme guarantees the global stability of the resulting closed-loop system in the sense that all signals involved are uniformly bounded. Two nonlinear systems, namely, inverted pendulum system and Chua's (1989) chaotic circuit, are fully illustrated to track sinusoidal signals. The resulting hybrid direct/indirect FNN control systems show better performances, i.e., tracking error and control effort can be made smaller and it is more flexible during the design process.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2002.1033178","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/22189/01033178.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2002.1033178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive hybrid intelligent control for uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive hybrid intelligent control for uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7398258","pubMedId":"18244863","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033178/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive hybrid intelligent control for uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems","sourcePdf":"01033178.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094608S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"22189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"22189","articleId":"1033178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1033179,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

A framework that captures the idea of efficient extension of image processing algorithms from the samples to the rest of the population is given. Computationally expensive (in time and/or space) image operators (e.g., neural networks (NNs) or clustering models) are trained on the sample, and then extended noniteratively to the rest of the population. We illustrate the general method using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to segment Indian satellite images. On average, the new method can achieve about 99% accuracy (relative to running the literal algorithm) using roughly 24% of the image for training. This amounts to an average savings of 76% in CPU time.

First, it is shown how the antecedent fuzzy sets and the corresponding consequent parameters of the TS model can be derived from clusters obtained by the Gath-Geva (GG) algorithm. To preserve the partitioning of the antecedent space, linearly transformed input variables can be used in the model. This may, however, complicate the interpretation of the rules. To form an easily interpretable model that does not use the transformed input variables, a new clustering algorithm is proposed, based on the expectation-maximization (EM) identification of Gaussian mixture models. This new technique is applied to two well-known benchmark problems: the MPG (miles per gallon) prediction and a simulated second-order nonlinear process. The obtained results are compared with results from the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033180/","accessionNumber":"7398260","pubMedId":"18244865","displayDocTitle":"Modified Gath-Geva fuzzy clustering for identification of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Gath-Geva fuzzy clustering for identification of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models","sourcePdf":"01033180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061808S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"22189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"22189","articleId":"1033180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1033184,"authors":[{"name":"Yunong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yunong Zhang","id":"37087145690"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Computer-Aided Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37087146257"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"1033184","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":550},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Torque","Constraint optimization","Manipulators","Robots","Kinetic energy","Computer networks","Kinematics","Acceleration","Energy resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundant manipulators","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual neural network","constrained real-time joint torque optimization","kinematically redundant manipulators","global kinetic energy minimization","robot mechanisms","inverse kinematics","acceleration level","limited joint range manipulators","neurons","PUMA 560 robot arm"]}],"abstract":"A dual neural network is presented for the real-time joint torque optimization of kinematically redundant manipulators, which corresponds to global kinetic energy minimization of robot mechanisms.

We point out a basic equivalence between antennas and OFDM-tones. This similarity immediately allows us to essentially reuse all space-time codes designed for flat-fading channels in MIMO-OFDM systems operating in frequency-selective channels. An optimum code would thus code across all antennas and tones (as well as time) simultaneously.

(These reconstruction constraints are normally combined with some form of smoothness prior to regularize their solution.) We derive a sequence of analytical results which show that the reconstruction constraints provide less and less useful information as the magnification factor increases. We also validate these results empirically and show that, for large enough magnification factors, any smoothness prior leads to overly smooth results with very little high-frequency content. Next, we propose a super-resolution algorithm that uses a different kind of constraint in addition to the reconstruction constraints. The algorithm attempts to recognize local features in the low-resolution images and then enhances their resolution in an appropriate manner. We call such a super-resolution algorithm a hallucination or reconstruction algorithm. We tried our hallucination algorithm on two different data sets, frontal images of faces and printed Roman text. We obtained significantly better results than existing reconstruction-based algorithms, both qualitatively and in terms of RMS pixel error.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033210/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7377238","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Limits on super-resolution and how to break them","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limits on super-resolution and how to break them","sourcePdf":"01033210.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084765S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"22191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"942","xplore-issue":"22191","articleId":"1033210","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1033211,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The interpretation of shading, edges, and junctions may provide a 3D model of the scene but it will not provide information about the actual \"scale\" of the space. One possible source of information for absolute depth estimation is the image size of known objects. However, object recognition, under unconstrained conditions, remains difficult and unreliable for current computational approaches. We propose a source of information for absolute depth estimation based on the whole scene structure that does not rely on specific objects. We demonstrate that, by recognizing the properties of the structures present in the image, we can infer the scale of the scene and, therefore, its absolute mean depth. We illustrate the interest in computing the mean depth of the scene with application to scene recognition and object detection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Motion measurement","Information resources","Object recognition","Image recognition","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object detection","object recognition","discrete Fourier transforms","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image structure depth estimation","cues","absolute depth measurements","discrete Fourier transform","image representation","binocular disparity","image motion","defocus","shading","3D model","image size","object recognition","scene structure","absolute mean depth","scene recognition","object detection"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1033214","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/22191/01033214.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1033214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth estimation from image structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Depth estimation from image structure","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7377242","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","volume":"24","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033214/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth estimation from image structure","sourcePdf":"01033214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070722S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"22191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"22191","articleId":"1033214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1033229,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

It provides the ability to deliver packet based multimedia services between the base station and the mobile device. Various studies have shown that major restrictions on system capacity and congestion occur at this air interface due to the limited transmission resources. Several papers have suggested fixed resource allocation schemes to allocate capacity among all users. This paper presents a method for dynamic sharing of resources and a call admission control scheme to control congestion. Our approach involves the use of a threshold based buffer management technique for stochastic scheduling of downlink transmissions. It takes advantage of the bursty nature of packet arrivals to reallocate system resources from users with low instantaneous requirements, to users with greater resource demands. Results show the possibility of significant improvement in system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICON.2002.1033323","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 10th IEEE International Conference on Networks (ICON 2002).

ST block codes are capable of realizing full diversity and spatial coding gains at relatively low rates; ST trellis codes can achieve better rate-diversity tradeoffs at the cost of high complexity. On the other hand, V-BLAST supports high rates but has no built-in spatial coding and does not work well with fewer receive than transmit antennas. We propose a novel linear block coding scheme based on the Khatri-Rao matrix product. The proposed scheme offers flexibility for achieving full-rate or full-diversity, or a desired rate-diversity tradeoff, and it can handle any transmit/receive antenna configuration or signal constellation.

Many different ST coding schemes have been proposed to achieve reliable communications in independent fading channels. However, a design of robust ST codes for correlated fading channels has not been addressed. We propose a simple robust ST coding scheme that achieves robust performance over a wide range of fading conditions. The key to achieve robust performance is to formulate code design criteria that are not dependent on the channel correlation statistics. A provably robust scheme can be formulated by concatenating a full-rank ST block code with an outer encoder. We derive several robust code examples via the concatenated orthogonal ST block code and TCM construction. The simulation results show that some traditional ST codes perform poorly, whereas the proposed codes achieve robust performance over a broad range of fading conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033672.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","startPage":"2408","endPage":"2416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust space-time codes for correlated Rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust space-time codes for correlated Rayleigh fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033672/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402078","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033672/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust space-time codes for correlated Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"01033672.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086625S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033672","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033673,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This technology is primarily concerned with two-dimensional (2-D) signal design for multitransmit antenna wireless systems. Despite the progress in ST coding, several important questions remain unanswered. In a practical multiuser setting, one would expect different users to experience different channel conditions. This motivates the design of robust ST codes that exhibit satisfactory performance in various environments. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of ST codes in line-of-sight and correlated Rayleigh fading channels. We develop the design criteria that govern the performance of ST codes in these environments. Our analysis demonstrates that full-diversity ST codes are essential to achieving satisfactory performance in line-of-sight channels. We further show that a simple phase randomization approach achieves significant performance gains in the line-of-sight case without affecting the performance in Rayleigh fading channels. In the correlated fading environments, we characterize the achievable diversity order based on the number of diversity degrees of freedom in the channel. This characterization supports experimental observations that suggest that the quasistatic model is not a worst-case scenario and establishes the necessary tradeoff between the transmission rate and performance robustness. Finally, we consider the design of ST codes using some prior knowledge about the channel spatio-temporal correlation function.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033673.pdf","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the robustness of space-time coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Fading","RF signals","Transmitting antennas","Space technology","Two dimensional displays","Performance analysis","Performance gain","Rayleigh channels","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh channels","antenna arrays","antenna theory","cellular radio","multi-access systems","channel coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time coding","robustness","wireless channel","multiuser setting","channel conditions","ST codes","line-of-sight channels","correlated Rayleigh fading channels","phase randomization approach","correlated fading environments","diversity order","quasistatic model","worst-case scenario","transmission rate","performance robustness","channel spatio-temporal correlation function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"On the robustness of space-time coding","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1033673/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402079","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the robustness of space-time coding","sourcePdf":"01033673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075572S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033674,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

For that reason, we first study the ideal fast-fading multiple transmit and receive antenna channel and then compare the performance of STCs with that of bit-interleaved coded modulation in fast fading. Mutual information of the ergodic channel is evaluated for numerous modulation scenarios, and capacity comparisons generate guidelines on how to jointly adjust coding rate and modulation cardinality. Bit-based coding offers large flexibility in rate adaptation, and simulation results show that it outperforms STCs in ideal fast fading and, finally, in a realistic OFDM application as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033675.pdf","startPage":"2442","endPage":"2450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding approaches for multiple antenna transmission in fast fading and OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Fading","Modulation coding","Interleaved codes","OFDM modulation","Channel coding","Frequency division multiplexing","Dispersion","Convolutional codes","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","fading channels","channel coding","OFDM modulation","antenna theory","dispersive channels","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding approaches","multiple antenna transmission","fast fading","OFDM","channel coding","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","dispersive channels","frequency interleaving","subcarriers","multiple transmit antennas","multiple receive antennas","mutual information","ergodic channel","modulation scenarios","coding rate","modulation cardinality","bit-based coding","OFDM application"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Coding approaches for multiple antenna transmission in fast fading and OFDM","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1033675/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402081","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding approaches for multiple antenna transmission in fast fading and OFDM","sourcePdf":"01033675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085006S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033676,"authors":[{"name":"A.

To mitigate the effects of such time variations, we propose a time-domain approach. We design ICI-mitigating block linear filters, and we examine how they are modified in the context of space-time block-coded transmissions. Our approach reduces to the familiar single-tap frequency-domain equalizer when the channel is block time invariant. Channel estimation in rapidly time-varying scenarios becomes critical, and we propose a scheme for estimating channel parameters varying within a transmission block. Along with the channel estimation scheme, we also examine the issue of pilot tone placement and show that in time-varying channels, it may be better to group pilot tones together into clumps that are equispaced onto the FFT grid; this placement technique is in contrast to the common wisdom for time-invariant channels. Finally, we provide numerical results illustrating the performance of these schemes, both for uncoded and space-time block-coded systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033676.pdf","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intercarrier interference in MIMO OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033676/","displayDocTitle":"Intercarrier interference in MIMO OFDM","volume":"50","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402082","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033676/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intercarrier interference in MIMO OFDM","sourcePdf":"01033676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103481S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"279","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033677,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/22196/1033677/1033677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiqiang Liu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Radio and Electronics, Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1991 and the M.E. degree from the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2001.","From 1995 to 1997, he worked as a research scholar at the Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore.

The major challenge in MIMO signal recovery is the mitigation of the inevitable intersymbol interference (ISI) and interchannel interference (ICI) in multipath MIMO channels. The Bezout system theory provides a simple solution for ISI/ICI cancellation and, thus, can serve as a powerful mathematical foundation for MIMO systems. If p<q and the MIMO system H(D) is right coprime, the system is perfectly recoverable via a Bezout equalizer. If p>q and the MIMO system H(D) is left coprime, the system is perfectly recoverable via a Bezout precoder, assuming the channel information is available at the transmitter. For a robust channel design, a quantitative analysis of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the optimal Bezout equalizer/precoder can be derived from the Bezout null space. Compared with the Alamouti(see IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1451-58, Oct. 1998) space-time coding, the Bezout precoder is shown to be more appealing in slowly time-varying channels, where the feedback of the channel information induces minor overhead. The Bezout system can work well jointly with the space-time block coding (STBC). The STBC can be adopted to artificially construct a larger q'/spl times/p' (q'>p') virtual transfer function without the channel information. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided for perfect recoverability (PR) for the STBC-induced virtual MIMO systems. Based on the virtual transfer function, both channel-independent and channel-dependent precoding strategies are feasible. Via a singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, the Bezout precoder can be shown to outperform the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) precoder in bit-error-rate (BER), transmission rate, and receiver implementation. The interplay of the two design parameters (N and /spl rho/) is analyzed to provide a simple guideline for an optimal configuration. The combined STBC and Bezout equalization techniques offer a broader spectrum of transceiver system configuration to achieve optimal design tradeoff among BER, transmission rate, and implementation complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bezout space-time precoders and equalizers for MIMO channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033680.pdf","startPage":"2499","endPage":"2514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Bezout space-time precoders and equalizers for MIMO channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1033680/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402086","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bezout space-time precoders and equalizers for MIMO channels","sourcePdf":"01033680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124977S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033681,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The transmission of pilot symbols, referred to as training, is often used to aid channel acquisition. In this paper, a class of generalized training schemes that allow the superposition of training and data symbols is considered. First, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a function of the power allocation matrices that characterize different training schemes. Then, equivalent training schemes are obtained, and the behavior of the CRLB is analyzed under different power constraints. It is shown that for certain training schemes, superimposing data with training symbols increases CRLB, and concentrating training power reduces CRLB. On the other hand, once the channel is acquired, uniformly superimposed power allocation maximizes the mutual information and, hence, the capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033681.pdf","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for space-time orthogonal block codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Block codes","MIMO","Mutual information","Space time codes","Uncertainty","Decoding","Throughput","Error analysis","Research initiatives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","MIMO systems","telecommunication channels","estimation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","space-time orthogonal block codes","pilot symbols","channel acquisition","generalized training schemes","Cramer-Rao lower bound","CRLB","power allocation matrices","mutual information","capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for space-time orthogonal block codes","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1033681/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402087","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for space-time orthogonal block codes","sourcePdf":"01033681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102414S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033682,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/22196/1033682/1033682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongbin Li (M'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, in 1991 and 1994, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 1999, all in electrical engineering.","From July 1996 to May 1999, he was a Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida.

In this paper, we consider the problem of multiuser receiver design for code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems that utilize DSCM for transmission. In particular, we propose two differential receivers for such systems. These differential receivers do not require the channel state information (CSI) for detection and, still, are resistant to multiuser interference (MUI) and time-varying channel fading. We also propose a coherent receiver that requires only the CSI of the desired user for detection. The coherent receiver yields improved performance over the differential receivers when reliable channel estimates are available (e.g., in slowly fading channels). The proposed differential/coherent receivers are decorrelative schemes that decouple the detection of different users. Both long and short spreading codes can be employed in these schemes. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential and coherent decorrelating multiuser receivers for space-time-coded CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803346","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033682.pdf","startPage":"2529","endPage":"2537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Differential and coherent decorrelating multiuser receivers for space-time-coded CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1033682/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402088","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential and coherent decorrelating multiuser receivers for space-time-coded CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01033682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103876S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033682","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033683,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The performance of these signaling strategies is highly dependent on MIMO channel characteristics, which, in turn, depend on antenna height and spacing and richness of scattering. In practice, large antenna spacings are often required to achieve significant multiplexing or diversity gain. The use of dual-polarized antennas (polarization diversity) is a promising cost- and space-effective alternative, where two spatially separated uni-polarized antennas are replaced by a single antenna structure employing orthogonal polarizations. This paper investigates the performance of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity (Alamouti (see IEEE J. Select. Areas Commun., vol.16, p.1451-58, Oct. 1998) scheme) in MIMO wireless systems employing dual-polarized antennas. In particular, we derive estimates for the uncoded average symbol error rate of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity and identify channel conditions where the use of polarization diversity yields performance improvements. We show that while improvements in terms of symbol error rate of up to an order of magnitude are possible in the case of spatial multiplexing, the presence of polarization diversity generally incurs a performance loss for transmit diversity techniques. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate that our estimates closely match the actual symbol error rates.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803322","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033685.pdf","startPage":"2553","endPage":"2562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multiantenna signaling techniques in the presence of polarization diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033685/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multiantenna signaling techniques in the presence of polarization diversity","volume":"50","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402091","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033685/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multiantenna signaling techniques in the presence of polarization diversity","sourcePdf":"01033685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077517S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033686,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Current approaches represent two extremes: idealized statistical models representing a rich scattering environment and parameterized physical models that describe realistic scattering environments via the angles and gains associated with different propagation paths. However, simple rules that capture the effects of scattering characteristics on channel capacity and diversity are difficult to infer from existing models. We propose an intermediate virtual channel representation that captures the essence of physical modeling and provides a simple geometric interpretation of the scattering environment. The virtual representation corresponds to a fixed coordinate transformation via spatial basis functions defined by fixed virtual angles. We show that in an uncorrelated scattering environment, the elements of the channel matrix form a segment of a stationary process and that the virtual channel coefficients are approximately uncorrelated samples of the underlying spectral representation. For any scattering environment, the virtual channel matrix clearly reveals the two key factors affecting capacity: the number of parallel channels and the level of diversity. The concepts of spatial zooming and aliasing are introduced to provide a transparent interpretation of the effect of antenna spacing on channel statistics and capacity. Numerical results are presented to illustrate various aspects of the virtual framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033686/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","volume":"50","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7402092","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033686/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deconstructing multiantenna fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deconstructing multiantenna fading channels","sourcePdf":"01033686.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122338S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"667","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033686","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1033687,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

Next, we treat the case of antenna subset selection when statistical channel knowledge (SCK) is employed by the selection algorithm. This analysis is applicable to general space-time coding schemes. When ECK is available, we show that the selection algorithm chooses the antenna set that maximizes the channel Frobenius norm leading to both coding and diversity gain. When SCK is available, the selection algorithm chooses the antenna set that maximizes the determinant of the covariance of the vectorized channel leading mostly to a coding gain. In case of ECK-based selection, we provide analytical expressions for average SNR and outage probability improvement. For the case when SCK-based selection is used, we derive expressions for coding gain.

Because channel state information is impossible to be known perfectly at the transmitter in practical wireless systems, we design, in this paper, an optimal multiantenna transmitter based on the knowledge of mean values of the underlying channels. Our optimal transmitter design turns out to be an eigen-beamformer with multiple beams pointing to orthogonal directions along the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the estimated channel at the transmitter and with proper power loading across beams. The optimality pertains to minimizing an upper bound on the symbol error rate, which leads to better performance than maximizing the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. Coupled with orthogonal space-time block codes, two-directional eigen-beamforming emerges as a more attractive choice than conventional one-directional beamforming with uniformly improved performance, without rate reduction, and without essential increase in complexity. With multiple receive antennas and reasonably good feedback quality, the two-directional eigen-beamformer is also capable of achieving the best possible performance in a large range of transmit-power-to-noise ratios, without a rate penalty.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/22196/01033689.pdf","startPage":"2599","endPage":"2613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2002.803355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2002.803355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22196","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal transmitter eigen-beamforming and space-time block coding based on channel mean feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Block codes","Feedback","Channel state information","Upper bound","Error analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Optical coupling","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","transmitting antennas","antenna arrays","feedback","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","array signal processing","block codes","correlation methods","matrix algebra","noise","receiving antennas","diversity reception","land mobile radio","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmitter eigen-beamforming","space-time block coding","channel mean feedback","water-filling principle","propagation channel","channel state information","wireless systems","optimal multiantenna transmitter","eigenvectors","correlation matrix","estimated channel","power loading","upper bound","symbol error rate","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","receiver","orthogonal space-time block codes","two-directional eigen-beamforming","one-directional beamforming","complexity","multiple receive antennas","feedback quality","transmit-power-to-noise ratio","multiantenna diversity","fading channels","rate penalty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optimal transmitter eigen-beamforming and space-time block coding based on channel mean feedback","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1033689/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7402095","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal transmitter eigen-beamforming and space-time block coding based on channel mean feedback","sourcePdf":"01033689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098556S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"22196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"22196","articleId":"1033689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033691,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Rios","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Mario A.

To determine an appropriate level of security, one should perform a probabilistic cost/benefit analysis that balances the cost of the security margin against its benefits, i.e., the expected societal cost of the avoided outages. This paper shows how a previously published method based on Monte Carlo simulation can be enhanced to take into account time-dependent phenomena (TDP) such as cascade tripping of elements due to overloads, malfunction of the protection system, and potential power system instabilities. In addition, the importance of using failure rates that reflect the weather conditions is discussed. Studies based on the South-Western part of the transmission network of England and Wales demonstrate the validity of the models that have been developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7400049","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1033691/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Value of security: modeling time-dependent phenomena and weather conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Value of security: modeling time-dependent phenomena and weather conditions","sourcePdf":"01033691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055972S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"22197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"22197","articleId":"1033691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1033695,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

ANNs are particularly appealing because of their ability to model an unspecified nonlinear relationship between load and weather variables. Weather forecasts are a key input when the ANN is used for forecasting. This paper investigates the use of weather ensemble predictions in the application of ANNs to load forecasting for lead times from one to ten days ahead. A weather ensemble prediction consists of multiple scenarios for a weather variable. We use these scenarios to produce multiple scenarios for load. The results show that the average of the load scenarios is a more accurate load forecast than that produced using traditional weather forecasts. We use the load scenarios to estimate the uncertainty in the ANN load forecast. This compares favorably with estimates based solely on historical load forecast errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network load forecasting with weather ensemble predictions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2002.800906","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/22197/01033703.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2002.800906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22197","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Neural network load forecasting with weather ensemble predictions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1033703/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7400061","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network load forecasting with weather ensemble predictions","sourcePdf":"01033703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047666S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"22197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"22197","articleId":"1033703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":1033717,"authors":[{"name":"I.N.

In a market situation, these forecasting errors lead to commercial risk through imbalance costs when advance contracting. This situation is one that needs to be addressed due to the steady increase in the amount of grid connected wind generation, combined with the rise of deregulated, market orientated electricity systems. In the presence of imbalance prices and uncertain generation, a method is required to determine the optimum level of contract energy to be sold on the advance markets. Such a method is presented here using Markov probabilities for a wind farm and demonstrates substantial reductions in the imbalance costs. The effect of market closure delays and forecasting window lengths are also shown.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033726/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7400084","volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Trading wind generation in short term energy markets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trading wind generation in short term energy markets","sourcePdf":"01033726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086887S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"22197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"238","xplore-issue":"22197","articleId":"1033726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033727,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The PMGA algorithm carefully schedules its processors, computational loads, and synchronization overhead for the best performance. The speedup upper bounds and the synchronization overheads on the Beowulf cluster are shown on different system sizes and different migration frequencies. The proposed PMGA is shown to be viable to the online implementation of the constrained ED due to substantial generator fuel cost savings and high speedup upper bounds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7400085","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1033727/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel micro genetic algorithm for constrained economic dispatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel micro genetic algorithm for constrained economic dispatch","sourcePdf":"01033727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091518S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"22197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"22197","articleId":"1033727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033728,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

To handle the problem complexity, decomposition schemes have been used. Usually, such schemes divide the expansion problem into two subproblems: one related to the construction of new plants (investment subproblem) and another dealing with the task of operating the system (operation subproblem). This paper proposes an iterative genetic algorithm (IGA) to solve the investment subproblem. The basic idea is to use a special type of chromosome, christened pointer-based chromosome (PBC), and the particular structure of that subproblem, to transform an integer constrained problem into an unconstrained one. IGA's results were compared to those of a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm-provided by a commercial package-in three different case studies of growing complexity, respectively, containing 144, 462, and 1845 decision variables. These results indicate that the IGA is an effective alternative to the solution of the investment subproblem.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2002.801036","startPage":"901","endPage":"906","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/22197/01033742.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2002.801036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation expansion planning: an iterative genetic algorithm approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Genetic algorithms","Linear programming","Large-scale systems","Investments","Biological cells","Power system planning","Uncertainty","Power system reliability","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power generation planning","power generation economics","investment","iterative methods","genetic algorithms","integer programming","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generation expansion planning","power systems","uncertainty","genetic algorithms","large-scale stochastic nonlinear optimization","operation subproblem","investment subproblem","iterative genetic algorithm","pointer-based chromosome","integer constrained problem","unconstrained problem","branch and bound algorithm","integer programming","optimization methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Generation expansion planning: an iterative genetic algorithm approach","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1033742/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7400100","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation expansion planning: an iterative genetic algorithm approach","sourcePdf":"01033742.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065702S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"22197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"22197","articleId":"1033742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1033743,"authors":[{"name":"L.

For redundancy removal in the input variables, reduction of the number of input variables has been done by the principal component analysis (PCA) method of factor extraction. The resultant dataset is used for the training of a 3-layered NN. To increase the learning speed, the weights and biases are initialized according to the Nguyen and Widrow method.

In the paper, an object detection method achieved by the fusion of millimeter-wave radar and a single video camera is proposed. We consider the method as the least expensive solution because at least one camera is necessary for lane marking detection. In the method, the distance is measured by the radar, and the boundaries are found from an image sequence, based on a motion stereo technique with the help of the distance measured by the radar.

Object detection by the method was confirmed through an experiment.

To this end, this paper has three main contributions. First, it proposes a new clustering method called CLARANS, whose aim is to identify spatial structures that may be present in the data. Experimental results indicate that, when compared with existing clustering methods, CLARANS is very efficient and effective. Second, the paper investigates how CLARANS can handle not only point objects, but also polygon objects efficiently. One of the methods considered, called the IR-approximation, is very efficient in clustering convex and nonconvex polygon objects. Third, building on top of CLARANS, the paper develops two spatial data mining algorithms that aim to discover relationships between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Both algorithms can discover knowledge that is difficult to find with existing spatial data mining algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033770/","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1033770/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7392867","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CLARANS: a method for clustering objects for spatial data mining","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CLARANS: a method for clustering objects for spatial data mining","sourcePdf":"01033770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09107S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"22199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"681","xplore-issue":"22199","articleId":"1033770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":1033780,"authors":[{"name":"Chanjung Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Education, Cheju National University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/22199/1033780/1033780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chanjung Park received the BS degree from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1988, the MS degree from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 1990, and the PhD degree in computer science from Sogang University in 1998.

Typically, a timing constraint is expressed in the form of a deadline and is represented as a priority to be used by schedulers. Recently, security has become another important issue in many real-time applications. In many systems, sensitive information is shared by multiple users with different levels of security clearance. As more advanced database systems are being used in applications that need to support timeliness while managing sensitive information, there is an urgent need to develop protocols for concurrency control in transaction management that satisfy both timing and security requirements. In this paper, we propose a new multiversion concurrency control protocol that ensures that both security and real-time requirements are met. The proposed protocol is primarily based on locking. However, in order to satisfy timing constraints and security requirements, a new method, called the freezing method, is proposed. In order to show that our protocol provides a higher degree of concurrency than existing multiversion protocols, we define a new serializability for multiversion concurrency control, called FR-serializability, which is more general than traditional serializability. We present several examples to illustrate the behavior of our protocol, along with performance comparisons with other protocols. The simulation results show significant performance improvement of the new protocol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033780/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7392876","volume":"14","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiversion locking protocol with freezing for secure real-time database systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiversion locking protocol with freezing for secure real-time database systems","sourcePdf":"01033780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104752S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"22199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"22199","articleId":"1033780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1033781,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Xiong","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/22199/1033781/1033781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Xiong received the BS degree in computer science and engineering in 1990 from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, the MS degree in computer science in 1993 from Sichuan University, and the PhD degree in computer science in 2000 from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Further, two time cognizant forced wait policies which improve performance significantly by forcing a transaction to delay further execution until a new version of sensor data becomes available are proposed. A way to exploit temporal data similarity to improve performance is also proposed. Finally, these policies are evaluated through detailed simulation experiments. The simulation results show that taking advantage of temporal data semantics in transaction scheduling can significantly improve the performance of user transactions in realtime database systems. In particular, it is demonstrated that under the forced wait policy, the performance can be improved significantly. Further improvements result by exploiting data similarity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/22199/01033781.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2002.1033781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2002.1033781","startPage":"1155","endPage":"1166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling transactions with temporal constraints: exploiting data semantics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033781/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling transactions with temporal constraints: exploiting data semantics","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033781/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"7392877","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling transactions with temporal constraints: exploiting data semantics","sourcePdf":"01033781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101756S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"22199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"22199","articleId":"1033781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":1033788,"authors":[{"name":"R.R.

Channel estimation based on a comb type pilot arrangement is studied through different algorithms for both estimating the channel at pilot frequencies and interpolating the channel. Channel estimation at pilot frequencies is based on LS and LMS methods while channel interpolation is done using linear interpolation, second order interpolation, low-pass interpolation, spline cubic interpolation, and time domain interpolation. Time-domain interpolation is obtained by passing to the time domain by means of IDFT (inverse discrete Fourier transform), zero padding and going back to the frequency domain by DFT (discrete Fourier transform). In addition, channel estimation based on a block type pilot arrangement is performed by sending pilots in every sub-channel and using this estimation for a specific number of following symbols. We have also implemented a decision feedback equalizer for all sub-channels followed by periodic block-type pilots. We have compared the performances of all schemes by measuring bit error rates with 16QAM, QPSK, DQPSK and BPSK as modulation schemes, and multipath Rayleigh fading and AR based fading channels as channel models.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2002.804034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/22202/01033876.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2002.804034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation techniques based on pilot arrangement in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation techniques based on pilot arrangement in OFDM systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033876/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7407452","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033876/","volume":"48","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation techniques based on pilot arrangement in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"01033876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06574S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"22202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"936","xplore-issue":"22202","articleId":"1033876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":1033877,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Usually, different RS codes and their corresponding encoders/decoders are designed and utilized to meet different requirements for different systems and applications. We incorporate these techniques into a variable RS code and present encoding and decoding algorithms suitable for the variable RS code. A mother RS code can be used to produce a variety of RS codes and the same encoder/decoder can be used for all the derivative codes, with adding/detecting zeros, removing some parity symbols and adding erasures. A VLSI implementation for erasure decoding of the variable RS code is described and the achievable performance is quantitatively analyzed. A typical example shows that the signal processing speed is up to 2.5 Gbits/second and the processing delay is less than one millisecond, when integrating the decoder on a single chip. Therefore, the proposed algorithm and the encoder/decoder can universally be utilized for different applications with various requirements, such as transmission data rate, packet length, packet loss protection capacity, as well as layered protection and adaptive redundancy protection in DVB/DAB, Internet and mobile Internet communications.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2002.803706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/22202/01033878.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2002.803706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22202","startPage":"237","endPage":"245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable shortened-and-punctured Reed-Solomon codes for packet loss protection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1033878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable shortened-and-punctured Reed-Solomon codes for packet loss protection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407454","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1033878/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable shortened-and-punctured Reed-Solomon codes for packet loss protection","sourcePdf":"01033878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071677S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"22202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"22202","articleId":"1033878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1033951,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The female binge eating disorder (BED) patients (n=20), involved in a residential weight control treatment including low-calorie diet (1200 cal/day) and physical training, were randomly assigned either to the multidimensional VR treatment or to psychonutritional groups based on the cognitive-behavior approach. Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomathology, attitudes toward food, body dissatisfaction, level of anxiety, motivation for change, level of assertiveness, and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short term, the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular, the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction, self-efficacy, and motivation for change. No significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior. The possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a VR-based short-term therapy can be useful to improve the body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs. However, given the nature of this research that does not include a followup study, the obtained results are preliminary only.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2002.802372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/22203/01033951.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2002.802372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual-reality-based multidimensional therapy for the treatment of body image disturbances in binge eating disorders: a preliminary controlled study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Virtual-reality-based multidimensional therapy for the treatment of body image disturbances in binge eating disorders: a preliminary controlled study","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7414965","pubMedId":"12381039","htmlLink":"/document/1033951/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual-reality-based multidimensional therapy for the treatment of body image disturbances in binge eating disorders: a preliminary controlled study","sourcePdf":"01033951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146451S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"22203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"22203","articleId":"1033951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033958,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

This was mainly due to the fact that reluctance rotor designs were not capable of generating saliency ratios large enough to make the BDFRM competitive with other machines. However, recent developments in reluctance rotors, spurred on by research into synchronous reluctance machines, has resulted in high saliency ratio rotors that are economic to build. This, together with the promise of higher efficiency and simpler control compared to the BDFIM, means that further investigation of the BDFRM is warranted. A relatively limited amount of work to date has been published on the BDFRM. This paper attempts to fill this void by presenting a theoretical analysis of some of the important control properties of the ideal BDFRM.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/22204/01033958.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"339","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2002.801997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2002.801997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of control properties for the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033958/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of control properties for the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine","htmlLink":"/document/1033958/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7400034","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of control properties for the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine","sourcePdf":"01033958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046123S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"22204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"22204","articleId":"1033958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1033961,"authors":[{"name":"T.

With this point in mind, an analytical approach to evaluate the performance of a three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentric conditions is presented in this paper. A clear and step-by-step theoretical analysis, explaining completely the presence of certain harmonics in the line-current spectrum in the presence of eccentricity, is discussed. More importantly, it is shown for the first time that a link exists between the low- and high-frequency elements of these harmonics. It is also shown that these high-frequency components are not very strong in all types of machine. These results will be useful in generating rules and laws to formulate online tools for machine condition monitoring. Finite-element results to substantiate the inductance values used in the simulation are also included. The analysis is validated by the line-current spectrum of the eccentric machine obtained through simulation using the modified winding-function approach (MWFA) and experimentation.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2002.801995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/22204/01033967.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2002.801995","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentricity condition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1033967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentricity condition","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1033967/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7400043","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentricity condition","sourcePdf":"01033967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067932S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"22204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"22204","articleId":"1033967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1033970,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Abido","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"p":["M.

We present a direct comparison of experimental data with numerical simulations. The numerical model employed here solves the centrally symmetric nonlinear Schrodinger equation including the instantaneous Kerr nonlinearity and second order dispersion, similar to the work of Rothenberg (1992). Our expectation for this model is to capture the behavior of the initial temporal and spatial compression in the regime prior to that in which other effects such as ionization, optical shock and electron refraction become important, with the goal of inferring the magnitude of the nonlinearity and the second order dispersion coefficient of air. In general, the dispersion coefficient affects the temporal collapse and not the spatial profile, whereas the nonlinear coefficient affects both spatial and temporal collapse. In the experiment, we measured the spatial and temporal profile of an approximately 100-200 fs, 800 nm pulse at propagation distances of 5.3 and 11.3 m as a function of the laser pulse energy. The numerical results clearly produce the trend of the spatial and temporal compression of the pulse as the laser energy is increased. We have explored a broad range of values in the nonlinear and dispersion coefficient; the best fit for the spatial and temporal collapse is shown. Despite a systematic difference in the temporal pulse width that can be attributed to the assumed pulse shape in the autocorrelation deconvolution, the experimental trends at 5.3 m are best represented by using a nonlinear coefficient of 0.04-0.06 fs-/spl mu/m/sup 2/ /nJ and a dispersion coefficient of 0.034 fs/sup 2///spl mu/m.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034030","publicationTitle":"Summaries of Papers Presented at the Lasers and Electro-Optics.

The photocathode RF gun can generate short pulse length electron bunches since the employed laser pulses in the RF gun are very short, such as in the picosecond or femtosecond region. It is considered that a picosecond square shaped pulse is one of the best candidates for low emittance electron beam generation. We have demonstrated the generation of square profile laser pulses in the ultraviolet region with durations up to 10 picoseconds. For this purpose, a pulse shaping apparatus was placed between a laser oscillator and an amplifier to avoid damage to the modulation devise. Since the spectral amplitude modulation of the laser pulses before the chirped pulse amplification may cause damage of optical elements in a regenerative amplifier, especially for a longer shaped pulse, a phase-only spectral filter, which does not cause damage in the process of the chirped pulse amplification, was used. Since the spectral phase-only filtering cannot be decided by any analytical method, we used a simulated annealing optimization algorithm to design the spectral phase-only modulation. The experimental system consists of a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser oscillator, a pulse shaping apparatus, a pulse stretcher, a regenerative amplifier and a pulse compressor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse generation","Pulse amplifiers","Pulse shaping methods","Radio frequency","Cathodes","Optical pulse shaping","Optical pulse generation","Pulse modulation","Optical amplifiers","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical pulse generation","optical pulse shaping","optical pulse compression","electron guns","photocathodes","high-speed techniques","optical filters","simulated annealing","phase modulation","laser mode locking","streak cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplified picosecond square shaped pulse generation","ultraviolet region","RF photocathode","square profile laser pulses","pulse shaping apparatus","laser oscillator","modulation devise","spectral amplitude modulation","laser pulses","chirped pulse amplification","optical element damage","regenerative amplifier","phase-only spectral filter","simulated annealing optimization algorithm","spectral phase-only modulation","photocathode RF gun","short pulse length electron bunches","picosecond square shaped pulse","low emittance electron beam generation","mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser oscillator","pulse stretcher","pulse compressor","10 ps","Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/:Ti"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034059","publicationTitle":"Summaries of Papers Presented at the Lasers and Electro-Optics.

We have previously proposed that using a waveguide optical amplifier with an exponentially increased gain profile we can greatly reduce the crosstalk between different wavelength channels. In this work, we propose to use the selective-area-growth (SAG)-technique produced gain materials to implement such kind of exponentially increased gain material, which requires only a single electrode and with simple uniform current injection. The SAG type of material uses oxide masks on top of semiconductor wafers to obtain materials with different wavelengths in one single crystal growth. The proposed method can reduce the crosstalk effect, improve the SOA performance, and makes it compatible to the EDFA. We believe that it will make the SOA an attractive candidate for optical amplification and switching applications at the metro and access area. It can also help SOA to serve as a gain medium for future photonic integrations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1034100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 May 2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-24 May 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1034100/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7528436","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low-crosstalk semiconductor optical amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-crosstalk semiconductor optical amplifiers","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1034100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034368S","chronDate":"24-24 May 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8035","isNumber":"22193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8035","xplore-issue":"22193","articleId":"1034100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Soc. of America","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1034103,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.K.

Segmented semiconductor optical amplifiers (SSOA) have been shown to be a promising candidate for header generation and recognition. Unfortunately, the low modulation depths in these experiments required signal averaging to reduce the noise floor below the output signal. In this presentation a SSOA with asymmetric segment lengths is used in conjunction with a pattern repetition rate of 500 MHz to increase the modulation depth beyond previous work. Pump-probe experiments conducted without signal averaging demonstrate an adequate signal-to-noise ratio that makes possible single shot optical correlation at 100 Gbit/s. Since gain and loss operate together to give the SSOA functionality it important to understand the gain and loss dynamics to achieve optimum performance such as maximizing the modulation depth of positive and negative bits and balancing the recovery time of the saturated gain and the saturated loss. The presentation addresses these issues in addition to the effects of wavelength on the picosecond time-scale operation of the device.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEO.2002.1034103","publicationTitle":"Summaries of Papers Presented at the Lasers and Electro-Optics.

Optical time-division-multiplexing (OTDM) allows high data rates without high-speed electronics. In a pulse train, interference can occur between each pulse and the pedestal of nearby pulses. In OTDM multiplexers, environmental fluctuations result in variations of the pulse-pedestal relative phase prior to recombination, yielding a slow modulation of the average power of the multiplexed data stream. The problem is alleviated if alternating polarization states are used; however, some demultiplexing schemes require uniformly polarized data streams. We employ a short-pulse source, described previously, and a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM) to demonstrate the effect of pedestal reduction on amplitude fluctuations. The complete pulse source consists of a 2.5 GHz gain-switched laser diode, a linear pulse compressor, an adiabatic soliton pulse compressor, and the NALM. The NALM provides pulse truncation and pedestal reduction through nonlinear transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1034203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 May 2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-24 May 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1034203/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7528518","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of nonlinear amplifying loop mirror to reduce power fluctuations in ultrafast optically time-division-multiplexed pulse trains","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of nonlinear amplifying loop mirror to reduce power fluctuations in ultrafast optically time-division-multiplexed pulse trains","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1034203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058496S","chronDate":"24-24 May 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8035","isNumber":"22193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8035","xplore-issue":"22193","articleId":"1034203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Soc. of America","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1034208,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This unprecedented low value corresponds to a relative timing jitter between laser carrier and envelope of 10 attoseconds (rms).

Significant progress has been obtained on quantum dot (QD) lasers, but the possible advantages of QD amplifiers are not yet clear. We show here that a relatively slow coupling between the optically active QD carrier states and the surrounding carrier reservoir can lead to efficient gain modulation suitable for ultrafast signal processing. The basis of this property is that the process of spectral hole burning (SHB) can become very effective. We consider a traveling wave optical amplifier consisting of the dot states, which interact with the optical signal (no inhomogeneous broadening included), and the wetting layer (WL), where current is injected. Time evolution is described by two coupled rate equations.

Our realistic three-dimensional (3D) model construction is based on: (i) the effective mass Hamiltonian in non-parabolic approximation for electrons, (ii) the effective mass Hamiltonian in parabolic approximation for holes, (iii) the position- and energy-dependent quasi-particle effective mass approximation for electrons, (iv) the finite hard wall confinement potential, and (v) the Ben Daniel-Duke boundary conditions. To solve this 3D nonlinear problem, we apply the nonlinear iterative method to obtain self-consistent solutions. Due to the penetration of the applied magnetic field into the torus region, we have found a non-periodical oscillation of the energy band gap versus magnetic fields between the lowest electron and hole states. The oscillation is shape- and size-dependent. The result is useful to describe magneto-optical properties of the nano-scale quantum rings.","doi":"10.1109/SISPAD.2002.1034540","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/8038/22206/01034540.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SISPAD.2002.1034540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of magnetic field effects on energy gap for nanoscale InAs/GaAs semiconductor ring structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1034540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1034540/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of magnetic field effects on energy gap for nanoscale InAs/GaAs semiconductor ring structures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7508964","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1034540/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of magnetic field effects on energy gap for nanoscale InAs/GaAs semiconductor ring structures","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"1034540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046848S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8038","isNumber":"22206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8038","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"22206","articleId":"1034540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Japan Soc. of Applied Physics","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1034591,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The proposed technique, acoustic factorisation, attempts to model explicitly all the factors that affect the acoustic signal. By explicitly modelling all the factors, the trained model set may be used in a more flexible fashion than in standard adaptive training schemes. Since an individual model is trained for each factor, it is possible to factor-in only those factors that are appropriate to a particular target domain, for example the distribution over all training speakers. The target domain specific factors are simply estimated from limited target specific data, for example the target acoustic environment. The paper describes the theory of this new approach for the transforms for a particular speaker and environment. Initial experiments on a large vocabulary speech recognition task are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1034593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2001","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-13 Dec. 2001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2001","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1034593/","accessionNumber":"7501114","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic factorisation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic factorisation","confLoc":"Madonna di Campiglio, Italy","sourcePdf":"1034593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031466S","chronDate":"2001","xplore-pub-id":"8037","isNumber":"22205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8037","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"22205","articleId":"1034593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1034616,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A drawback of this approach is that the time-asynchrony of the language model weight application during search leads to performance degradations. This is particularly so when performing the search with a tight pruning beam. This study presents a method for smoothing the language model within the recognition network. The optimization goal is the smearing of transition probabilities from HMM state to HMM state in favor of a more time-synchronous language model weight application. In addition, state-based language model look-ahead is proposed and evaluated.

In particular, we present an alternative to full, static expansion and optimization of the finite-state transducer network. This alternative is useful when the individual knowledge sources, modeled as transducers, are too large to be composed and optimized. While the recognition decoder perceives a single, weighted finite-state transducer, we apply a divide-and-conquer technique to split the language model into two parts which add up exactly to the original language model. We investigate the merits of these 'incremental language models' and present some initial results.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2001.

This image processing method should better model the time-frequency structure in speech signals. The method calculates the emission probability of a standard HMM by embedded HMM for each state. If a temporal sequence of spectral vectors is imagined as a spectrogram, this leads to a 2-dimensional warping of the spectrogram. This additional warping of the frequency axis could be useful for speaker-independent recognition and can be considered to be similar to a vocal tract normalization. The effects of this paradigm are investigated in this paper using the TI-Digits database.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2001.1034679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, 2001.

The peaks of the CP function yield unbiased estimates of the instantaneous (angular) frequency rate (IFR) and, hence, can be used as the basis for an IFR estimation algorithm.

This amplified signal is received in an orthogonal port of the feed array so that the entire structure acts as a spatial power combiner.

The VNN can accept interval-value input data as well as scalar input data. The input features of the EID problems include the radio frequency, pulse width, and pulse repetition interval of a received emitter signal. Since the values of these features vary in interval ranges in accordance with a specific radar emitter, the VNN is proposed to process interval-value data in the EID problem. In the training phase, the interval values of the three features are presented to the input nodes of VNN. A new vector-type backpropagation learning algorithm is derived from an error function defined by the VNN's actual output and the desired output indicating the correct emitter type of the corresponding feature intervals. The algorithm can tune the weights of VNN optimally to approximate the nonlinear mapping between a given training set of feature intervals and the corresponding set of desired emitter types. After training, the VNN can be used to identify the sensed scalar-value features from a real-time received emitter signal. A number of simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and identification capability of VNN, including the two-EID problem and the multi-EID problem with/without additive noise. The simulated results show that the proposed algorithm cannot only accelerate the convergence speed, but it can help avoid getting stuck in bad local minima and achieve higher classification rate.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2002.801387","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/22209/01035002.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1127","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2002.801387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector neural network for emitter identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"A vector neural network for emitter identification","volume":"50","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7407439","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035002/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector neural network for emitter identification","sourcePdf":"01035002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079549S","chronDate":"Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"22209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"22209","articleId":"1035002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1035004,"authors":[{"name":"Shiunn-Jang Chern","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/22209/1035004/1035004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shiunn-Jang Chern received the B.S. degree from Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., the M.S. degree from Southeastern Massachusetts University, North Dartmouth, MA, and the Ph.D. degree from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, in 1977, 1982, and 1986, respectively.","He is currently a Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yet-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

In fact, by using the inverse QR decomposition-recursive least squares (QRD-RLS) algorithm approach, the least-squares (LS) weight vector can be computed without back substitution and is suitable for implementation using a systolic array to achieve fast convergence and good numerical properties. The merits of this new constrained algorithm are verified by evaluating the performance, in terms of the learning curve, to investigate the convergence property and numerical efficiency, and the output signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional linearly constrained LMS (LCLMS) algorithm, and the one using the fast linear constrained RLS algorithm and its modified version.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/22209/01035004.pdf","startPage":"1138","endPage":"1150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2002.801276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2002.801276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22209","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive linearly constrained inverse QRD-RLS beamforming algorithm for moving jammers suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Jamming","Sensor arrays","Resonance light scattering","Interference constraints","Adaptive arrays","Least squares methods","Systolic arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming","interference suppression","adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","adaptive signal processing","recursive filters","least squares approximations","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearly constrained algorithm","recursive least squares algorithm","adaptive beamforming algorithms","array signal processing","moving jammer suppression","RLS filters","wireless communication systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive linearly constrained inverse QRD-RLS beamforming algorithm for moving jammers suppression","volume":"50","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1035004/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407440","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive linearly constrained inverse QRD-RLS beamforming algorithm for moving jammers suppression","sourcePdf":"01035004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070614S","chronDate":"Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"22209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"22209","articleId":"1035004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035005,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Finite-difference time-domain simulation is used for optimization of the antenna and the results agree very well with measurements. Additionally, a gain-enhanced design is presented, where higher gain has been achieved at the cost of reduced bandwidth. These quasi-Yagi antennas are realized on a high dielectric constant substrate and are completely compatible with microstrip circuitry and solid-state devices. The excellent radiation properties of this antenna make it ideal as either a stand-alone antenna with a broad pattern or as an array element.

The primary motivation of the present work is to define a topographic microprocessor architecture for MTT with embedded sensors capable of operating in a process real-time manner. In the ongoing experiments it is assumed that the input data flow is acquired by a single array sensor and the data is processed on an adaptive CNN-UM architecture consisting of both a cellular nonlinear network (CNN) and digital signal processing (DSP) microprocessors. The algorithms designed for this combined hardware platform use adaptive multi-channel CNN solutions for instantaneous position estimation and morphological characterization of all visible targets and the DSP environment for distance calculation, gating, data association, track maintenance and dynamic target motion prediction. A special feature of the architecture is that it allows interactive communication between the sensor and the digital environment. The configuration of functional modules for various real-time applications is discussed.

For example, vehicles driving without human guidance need robust prediction of potential obstacles, like other vehicles or pedestrians. Most common approaches of obstacle detection so far have used analytical and statistical methods like motion estimation or generation of maps. The proposed procedures are mostly composed of many processing steps, so that error propagation of successive steps often leads to inaccurate results. Another problem is the necessity of high computing power for real time applications. In this contribution we demonstrate that obstacle detection in planar worlds can be performed efficiently using cellular neural networks. Beside a fast processing speed the proposed method is also very robust.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2002.1035074","startPage":"383","endPage":"390","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 7th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2002.1035074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22212","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 7th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8041/22212/01035074.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle detection in planar worlds using cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035074/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Obstacle detection in planar worlds using cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1035074/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7492784","publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"24-24 July 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jul 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle detection in planar worlds using cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Frankfurt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1035074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059906S","chronDate":"22-24 Jul 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8041","isNumber":"22212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8041","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"22212","articleId":"1035074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"World Scientific Publ.

Design challenges, trade-offs and the building blocks of such a high-complexity system (0.5 /spl times/ 10/sup 6/ transistors, most of them operating in analog mode) are presented in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2002.1035082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2002.1035082","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 7th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 7th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/8041/22212/01035082.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jul 2002","displayDocTitle":"CMOS realization of a 2-layer CNN universal machine chip","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-24 July 2002","accessionNumber":"7492792","htmlLink":"/document/1035082/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS realization of a 2-layer CNN universal machine chip","confLoc":"Frankfurt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1035082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048136S","chronDate":"22-24 Jul 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8041","isNumber":"22212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8041","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"22212","articleId":"1035082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"World Scientific Publ.

In contrast to other solutions our approach offers on-line possibilities in applications as its operation needs consist of mainly local interactions that are well suited to the architecture of cellular neural/non-linear networks (CNN).

The procedure presented in this contribution generates highly adapted sets of templates for complex image processing tasks. With this approach it is also possible to tune existing CNN programs to compensate inaccuracies of analog CNN hardware leading to noise reduction and more robust behaviour. Finally, an application of practical interest has been developed, by using the introduced method.

In the proposed RMCNN, the combined four-quadrant multiplier and two-quadrant divider with separated magnitude and sign is used to implement the Hebbian learning function and the ratio memory. To enhance the capability of pattern learning and recognition from noisy input patterns, the Z-template and the spatial-dependent self-feedback weights in the template A are applied to the proposed new type of RMCNN. The pattern learning and recognition function of the 18/spl times/18 RMCNN is simulated by Matlab software. It has been verified that the advanced RMCNN has the advantages of more stored patterns for recognition, and better recovery rate as compared to the original RMCNN. Thus the proposed RMCNN has great potential in the applications of neural associate memory for image processing.","doi":"10.1109/CNNA.2002.1035102","pdfPath":"/iel5/8041/22212/01035102.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"615","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 7th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2002 7th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and Their Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CNNA.2002.1035102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of ratio-memory cellular neural network (RMCNN) with self-feedback template weight for pattern learning and recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jul 2002","displayDocTitle":"The design of ratio-memory cellular neural network (RMCNN) with self-feedback template weight for pattern learning and recognition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7492813","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035102/","conferenceDate":"24-24 July 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of ratio-memory cellular neural network (RMCNN) with self-feedback template weight for pattern learning and recognition","confLoc":"Frankfurt, Germany","sourcePdf":"1035102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049084S","chronDate":"22-24 Jul 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8041","isNumber":"22212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8041","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"22212","articleId":"1035102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"World Scientific Publ.

We show that the capacity C/sub E/ is given by an expression parallel to that for the capacity of a purely classical channel: i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs /spl rho/, of the entropy of the channel input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of /spl rho/ after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement-assisted communication - communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between parties who share prior random information - we show that one parameter is sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all DMCs of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.802612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/22215/01035117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.802612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22215","startPage":"2637","endPage":"2655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel and the reverse Shannon theorem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel and the reverse Shannon theorem","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407456","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel and the reverse Shannon theorem","sourcePdf":"01035117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136863S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"22215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"342","xplore-issue":"22215","articleId":"1035117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":1035119,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The scheduling is such that the flow of a session depends on the congestion of the next hop links. MMRS is throughput optimal. In addition, it has several other attractive features. It is computationally simple and can be implemented in a distributed, asynchronous manner. It has several parameters which can be suitably modified to control the end-to-end delay and packet loss in a topology-specific manner.

The channel is affected by block fading, and the channel state is perfectly known to the receiver but unknown to the transmitters. To cope with multiaccess interference (MAI) and fading, the users employ retransmission of erroneously received packets. We consider unspread and randomly spread (code-division multiple-access (CDMA)) systems with decentralized (single-user) decoding and a system where the receiver employs joint multiuser decoding. The following conclusions can be drawn from our analysis: (a) unspread systems with packet retransmission outperforms CDMA systems with conventional detection, but are outperformed by CDMA with linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection. (b) For all systems based on single-user decoding (SUD), there exists a threshold value of (E/sub b//N/sub o/) below which the throughput is maximized by an infinite number of users per dimension transmitting at vanishing rate, and above which the throughput is maximized by a finite average number of users per dimension transmitting at nonvanishing rate. Moreover, as (E/sub b//N/sub o/) increases, the optimal average number of users per dimension tends to one. In this sense, we say that the optimized systems \"self-orthogonalize.\" (c) For the system based on joint multiuser decoding, a simple slotted ALOHA strategy is able to recover the throughput penalty due to fading in the limit for high (E/sub b//N/sub o/), while an incremental redundancy (INR) strategy recovers the fading penalty for any (E/sub b//N/sub o/).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The throughput of some wireless multiaccess systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2002.802629","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/22215/01035129.pdf","startPage":"2773","endPage":"2785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2002.802629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"The throughput of some wireless multiaccess systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1035129/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407468","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The throughput of some wireless multiaccess systems","sourcePdf":"01035129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071787S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"22215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"22215","articleId":"1035129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035133,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Wen Chen","id":"37087284465"},{"name":"S.

This paper: (1) develops an averaged model of the parallel converters based on a phase-leg averaging technique; (2) a zero-sequence model is then developed to predict the dynamics of the zero-sequence current; (3) based on the zero-sequence model, this paper introduces a new control variable, which is associated with space-vector modulation; (4) a strong zero-sequence current control loop is designed to suppress the circulating current; and (5) simulation and experimental results validate the developed model and the proposed control scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2002.802170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/22214/01035134.pdf","startPage":"609","endPage":"615","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2002.802170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of circulating current in two parallel three-phase boost rectifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Control of circulating current in two parallel three-phase boost rectifiers","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035134/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7408134","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of circulating current in two parallel three-phase boost rectifiers","sourcePdf":"01035134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055629S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"289","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":1035141,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

A vibrating piezoelectric device differs from a typical electrical power source in that it has a capacitive rather than inductive source impedance, and may be driven by mechanical vibrations of varying amplitude. An analytical expression for the optimal power flow from a rectified piezoelectric device is derived, and an \"energy harvesting\" circuit is proposed which can achieve this optimal power flow. The harvesting circuit consists of an AC-DC rectifier with an output capacitor, an electrochemical battery, and a switch-mode DC-DC converter that controls the energy flow into the battery. An adaptive control technique for the DC-DC converter is used to continuously implement the optimal power transfer theory and maximize the power stored by the battery. Experimental results reveal that use of the adaptive DC-DC converter increases power transfer by over 400% as compared to when the DC-DC converter is not used.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2002.802194","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2002.802194","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/22214/01035141.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit for wireless remote power supply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit for wireless remote power supply","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7408141","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035141/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit for wireless remote power supply","sourcePdf":"01035141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047573S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"825","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035142,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The paper proposes a novel tri-state boost converter without such a zero in the transfer function. The additional degree of freedom introduced in the converter in the form of a freewheeling interval has been exploited through an easy control technique to achieve this elimination. The absence of the RHP zero allows the control scheme to achieve larger bandwidth under closed-loop conditions, resulting in fast response. Analytical, simulation and experimental results of the tri-state boost converter have been presented and compared with those of the classical boost converter both under open-loop and under closed-loop operating conditions. The results clearly demonstrate the superior dynamic performance of the proposed converter. The proposed converter can be used in applications wherever fast-response boost action is needed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035142/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7408142","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel tri-state boost converter with fast dynamics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel tri-state boost converter with fast dynamics","sourcePdf":"01035142.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044612S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1035145,"authors":[{"name":"Hyosung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Cheonan National Technical College, ChungNam, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/22214/1035145/1035145-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyosung Kim (M'95) was born in Seoul, Korea, on October 20, 1958.

The proposed induction motor drive with a digital dead-beat controller shows good transient response and negligible steady-state error even at a low switching frequency, which is needed for high power machines used for transportation. Including the rotor dynamics, the stability condition and steady-state error of the proposed control system have been examined in the z-plane. In addition, the good performance has been verified through the simulation and experiment. The flux and torque controllers have been designed with only stator voltage equations in the stator flux reference frame in order to take advantages of the direct torque control. Therefore, the proposed flux and torque controllers have simple forms and can be easily designed and implemented.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2002.802174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2002.802174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22214","startPage":"739","endPage":"746","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/22214/01035149.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035149","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Digital control","Induction motors","Steady-state","Error correction","Stators","Induction motor drives","Transient response","Switching frequency","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine vector control","torque control","control system synthesis","machine theory","digital control","power engineering computing","control system analysis","transient response","rotors","stability","stators","machine testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drive direct torque control","dead-beat type digital controller","control design","transient response","steady-state error","switching frequency","rotor dynamics","stability condition","z-plane analysis","control performance","control simulation","flux controllers","torque controllers have","stator voltage equations","stator flux reference frame"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A dead-beat type digital controller for the direct torque control of an induction motor","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7408149","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035149/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035149/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dead-beat type digital controller for the direct torque control of an induction motor","sourcePdf":"01035149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059952S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1035150,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Chi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Air Conditioners, Energy and Resources Laboratories (ERL), Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/22214/1035150/1035150-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hung-Chi Chen was born in Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

In this paper, the studies about these two issues to enhance the performance of BDCM drive are made. First, the sensorless inverter-fed BDCM drive with a proposed current command generation scheme is established. An intelligent commutation instant tuning technique is developed to pursue better motor torque generating characteristics. For achieving this goal, the motor drawn line current minimization is employed as the performance index in making the commutation tuning. After generating the current command with adequate commutation, a robust current-mode controller is further developed and applied to greatly speed up the square wave current tracking response and the response is rather insensitive to the machine parameter and back electromotive force (back-EMF) changes. In Addition, a simple starting method and a speed estimation approach are also proposed. Some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/22214/01035150.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2002.802176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2002.802176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-mode control for sensorless BDCM drive with intelligent commutation tuning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensorless control","Intelligent sensors","Commutation","Brushless DC motors","DC motors","Torque","Character generation","Performance analysis","Robust control","Force control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","DC motor drives","machine control","electric current control","commutation","robust control","torque","invertors","machine windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","sensorless BDCM drive","intelligent commutation tuning","winding current response speed","commutation","control performance","sensorless brushless DC motor drive","sensorless inverter-fed BDCM drive","current command generation","intelligent commutation instant tuning","motor torque","line current minimization","performance index","commutation tuning","robust current-mode controller","square wave current tracking response","back electromotive force","starting method","speed estimation approach","current-mode control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Current-mode control for sensorless BDCM drive with intelligent commutation tuning","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035150/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7408150","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-mode control for sensorless BDCM drive with intelligent commutation tuning","sourcePdf":"01035150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071286S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035152,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Welchko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/22214/1035152/1035152-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brian A.

This fault results in rotational electromagnetic asymmetry on both the stator and rotor, making it difficult to analyze using classical dq-transformation techniques. This paper presents a new dq synchronous-frame machine model that is capable of handling this highly asymmetrical fault condition, including the effects of q axis magnetic saturation. Fault responses with two alternative post-fault control strategies are investigated: (1) opening all of the inverter switches so that the machine behaves as an uncontrolled generator (UCG), with the two unfaulted phases connected to the inverter DC link via the antiparallel diodes; and (2) shorting the two remaining unfaulted phases together using the inverter switches. Results of this investigation show that the fault response is generally more benign using the UCG control strategy, with significantly lower phase currents and pulsating torque than corresponding values delivered using the phase-shorting strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2002.802180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/22214/01035152.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2002.802180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22214","startPage":"764","endPage":"771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IPM synchronous machine drive response to a single-phase open circuit fault","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IPM synchronous machine drive response to a single-phase open circuit fault","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7497913","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035152/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IPM synchronous machine drive response to a single-phase open circuit fault","sourcePdf":"01035152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057077S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1035154,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is shown that the existing open-loop control strategy used in the DVR to regulate load voltage can produce poorly damped response due to the presence of the switching harmonic filter in the restorer. Damping is shown to be improved if the proposed multiloop controller is used. Furthermore, the new control scheme permits a closer tracking of the reference load voltage under varied load conditions. The analysis of the proposed method is then validated by simulation studies and laboratory experimental tests which show the efficacy of the new control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/22214/01035159.pdf","startPage":"824","endPage":"834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2002.802189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2002.802189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22214","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of the dynamic voltage restorer with closed-loop load voltage and current-mode control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage control","Open loop systems","Pulse width modulation","Power supplies","Damping","Bridge circuits","Harmonic filters","Power quality","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","voltage control","control system synthesis","power supply quality","closed loop systems","electric current control","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop load voltage control","closed-loop current-mode control","dynamic voltage restorer","power supply quality","control design","poorly damped response","switching harmonic filter","reference load voltage tracking","varied load conditions","control simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of the dynamic voltage restorer with closed-loop load voltage and current-mode control","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035159/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7408158","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of the dynamic voltage restorer with closed-loop load voltage and current-mode control","sourcePdf":"01035159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051063S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"22214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"22214","articleId":"1035159","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035161,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A better performing solution for power smoothing can be easily found by using a supercapacitor-based storage device, connected to the intermediary circuit of a variable-speed-drive system. In this paper, power and energy considerations are being accounted for in the design of the storage tank and regarding the maximum power demand from the feeding network. For the power-conversion circuit, which is necessary to compensate the voltage variations of the supercapacitors during charge and discharge, a high-efficiency converter, topology is proposed, which allows the bidirectional energy flow under soft-commutation conditions. Additionally it offers a good flexibility for the optimal sizing of the supercapacitor voltage level. The typical behavior of the special converter is given, together with an analysis of the advantages related to the specific application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1035161/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7407521","volume":"38","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A supercapacitor-based energy-storage system for elevators with soft commutated interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A supercapacitor-based energy-storage system for elevators with soft commutated interface","sourcePdf":"01035161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087754S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"22216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"22216","articleId":"1035161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1035172,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

In this paper, frequency responses of the cable characteristic and the motor input impedances are obtained experimentally and suitable models are developed to match the experimental results. Several lumped segments incorporating a lossy representation of the line are used to model the cable. The cable and induction motor models may be implemented using a computational tool such as MATLAB, thereby providing a convenient method to analyze the overvoltage phenomena. Simulation and experimental results are presented for a typical 3-hp induction motor, showing the suitability of the developed simulation models. The most promising dv/dt filter networks are also investigated through simulation analysis, and a design approach based on a tradeoff between filter losses and motor peak voltage is proposed. Experimental results of an RC filter placed at the motor terminals demonstrate the validity of the simulation models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/22216/01035183.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2002.802920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2002.802920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-frequency modeling for cable and induction motor overvoltage studies in long cable drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Voltage control","Mathematical model","Power cables","Computational modeling","Filters","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Frequency","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","power cables","overvoltage","machine theory","losses","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency modeling","cable overvoltage","induction motor overvoltage","long cable drives","pulsewidth modulation drives","long feeders","frequency responses","motor input impedances","lumped segments","lossy representation","MATLAB","computational tool","induction motor","simulation models","dv/dt filter networks","simulation analysis","filter losses","motor peak voltage","motor terminals","adjustable-speed drives","3 hp"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"High-frequency modeling for cable and induction motor overvoltage studies in long cable drives","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035183/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407542","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-frequency modeling for cable and induction motor overvoltage studies in long cable drives","sourcePdf":"01035183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050387S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"22216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"22216","articleId":"1035183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035188,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

For these reasons, six-phase induction motors are beginning to be a widely acceptable alternative in high power applications. A typical construction of such drives includes an induction machine with a dual three-phase connection, where two three-phase groups are spatially shifted 30 electrical degrees, a six-leg inverter, and a control circuit. By controlling the machine's phase currents, harmonic elimination and torque-ripple reduction techniques could be implemented. This paper describes a technique of injecting third harmonic zero sequence current components in the phase currents, which greatly improves the machine torque density. Analytical, finite-element, and experimental results are presented to show the system operation and to demonstrate the improvement on the torque density.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque density improvement in a six-phase induction motor with third harmonic current injection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2002.802938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/22216/01035189.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2002.802938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22216","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Torque density improvement in a six-phase induction motor with third harmonic current injection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035189/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407548","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque density improvement in a six-phase induction motor with third harmonic current injection","sourcePdf":"01035189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059273S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"22216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"204","xplore-issue":"22216","articleId":"1035189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1035190,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The modulator is constrained to select only from the three active space vectors nearest to the target reference phasor, and consequently achieves a significantly improved harmonic performance compared to other hysteresis modulators. Furthermore, by shifting the reference origin on the vector diagram, the proposed modulator can achieve the same optimal space vector sequence and placement, and therefore the same harmonic performance, as the well-known centered space-vector modulation. Without major hardware modifications, the proposed flux modulation scheme can also be readily modified to achieve reduced-common-mode voltage switching, while retaining the same optimal vector sequence and placement. Also, since the modulator is a closed-loop system, it exhibits excellent robustness to parameter variations and other system disturbances. The performance and practicability of the new modulator have been verified both in simulation and experimentally.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035193/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7407552","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035193/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flux modulation for multilevel inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux modulation for multilevel inverters","sourcePdf":"01035193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055147S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"22216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"22216","articleId":"1035193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1035197,"authors":[{"name":"Dewei Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/22216/1035197/1035197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dewei Xu received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1996, 1998, and 2001, respectively.","Since September 2001, he has been a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada, where he is working on super-high-power converters for ac drives.

It can only be reduced significantly by transitioning the embedded radio to a sleep state, at which point the node essentially retracts from the network topology. Existing topology management schemes have focused on cleverly selecting which nodes can turn off their radio, without sacrificing the capacity of the network. We propose a new technique, called sparse topology and energy management (STEM), that dramatically improves the network lifetime by exploiting the fact that most of the time, the network is only sensing its environment waiting for an event to happen. By alleviating the restriction of network capacity preservation, we can trade off extensive energy savings for an increased latency to set up a multi-hop path. We will also show how STEM integrates efficiently with existing topology management techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035239/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"7529093","publicationDate":"2002","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1035239/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"STEM: Topology management for energy efficient sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"STEM: Topology management for energy efficient sensor networks","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100209S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"22220","articleId":"1035239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1035242,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000), a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station then it will deplete its power quickly. The LEACH protocol presented by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, LEACH achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based protocol that is an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH by about 100 to 300% when 1%, 20%, 50%, and 100% of nodes die for different network sizes and topologies.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22220/01035242.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035242","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PEGASIS: Power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PEGASIS: Power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035242/","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035242/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7534986","isConference":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PEGASIS: Power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049499S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"1452","xplore-issue":"22220","articleId":"1035242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1035252,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The Block-V Receiver of the Deep Space Network has a carrier synchronization loop for offset QPSK, but this loop has four stable lock points within each cycle of carrier phase. In this paper, a method is proposed for reducing this four-fold phase ambiguity to two fold. This can be accomplished with the addition of simple signal processing at both the transmitter and receiver. The two-fold phase ambiguity is resolved by a unique synchronization word, just as is commonly done already with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). This strategy of reducing the four-fold phase ambiguity to a two-fold phase ambiguity does require periodic bit inversions at the modulator. So this solution is not available for the general offset QPSK modulator that does not include the necessary periodic bit inversions.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035265","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22220/01035265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22220","startPage":"3","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier synchronization of offset QPSK for deep space telemetry","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Carrier synchronization of offset QPSK for deep space telemetry","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7529115","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1035265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier synchronization of offset QPSK for deep space telemetry","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040553S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"22220","articleId":"1035265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035284,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

In free-space communication systems, atmospheric conditions can cause large variations in optical transmission and subsequently in the bit level means and variances. An adaptive thresholding method has been developed which uses an LRT threshold for detection while tracking the bit means and variances with a Kalman filter algorithm that can be implemented with any number of samples per bit. Previous Kalman filter development, designed for slower data rates, required multiple samples per bit. The Kalman filter discussed in this paper requires only one sample per bit and is suitable for high-speed data links. The development of this Kalman filter routine are discussed. The results of simulations comparing BER performance of the adaptive LRT algorithm to the matched filter algorithm and to theoretical predictions are shown. Additional simulations compare the performance of the Kalman filter adaptive LRT with a maximum likelihood estimator for tracking means and variances.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035284","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22220/01035284.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive thresholding for free-space optical communication receivers with multiplicative noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive thresholding for free-space optical communication receivers with multiplicative noise","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7529132","htmlLink":"/document/1035284/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive thresholding for free-space optical communication receivers with multiplicative noise","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112481S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"22220","articleId":"1035284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035291,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

Unfortunately, due to the homogeneity of the Earth's surface many pixels in such imagery function as background and serve to obscure or hide a desired target. In many cases, the primary reason for collecting the hyperspectral imagery is to find a pixel or two representing statistical scene anomalies. Few commercial applications focus on this essential aspect of hyperspectral image processing. More often, the primary focus of commercial image processing packages is the more abundant pixels to the exclusion of the few anomalous pixels. Toward this end we have developed a system based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) that cluster the data then evaluates the relationship of the data to the cluster centers. Those pixels located farthest from the cluster centers are found on the outer surface of the convex hull enclosing the hyperspectral dataset. In addition, these outlying pixels represent anomalies within the dataset and their location in proximity to an individual cluster center may merely be serendipitous. This procedure for locating anomalous pixel is demonstrated in a 1998 AVIRIS scene of the Copper Flat porphyry copper deposit. The approach is applicable to other domains besides geology and mineral exploration.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035291","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22220/01035291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22220","startPage":"3","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using self-organizing maps for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using self-organizing maps for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035291/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7529138","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1035291/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using self-organizing maps for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036319S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"22220","articleId":"1035291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035347,"authors":[{"name":"W.

These rovers will have the ability to navigate safely through unknown and potentially hazardous terrain, using autonomous passive stereo vision to detect potential terrain hazards before driving into them. Unfortunately, the computational power of currently available radiation hardened processors limits the amount of distance (and therefore science) that can be safely achieved by any rover in a given time frame. We present overviews of our current rover vision and navigation systems, to provide context for the types of computation that are required to navigate safely. We also present baseline timing results that represent a lower bound in achievable performance (useful for systems engineering studies of future missions), and describe ways to improve that performance using commercial grade (as opposed to radiation hardened) processors. In particular, we document speedups to our stereo vision system that were achieved using the vectorized operations provided by Pentium MMX technology. Timing data were derived from implementations on several platforms: a prototype Mars rover with flight-like electronics (the Athena Software Development Model (SDM) rover), a RAD6000 computing platform (as will be used in the 2003 MER missions), and research platforms with commercial Pentium III and Sparc processors. Finally, we summarize the radiation effects analysis that suggests that commercial grade processors are likely to be adequate for Mars surface missions, and discuss the level of speedup that may accrue from using these instead of radiation hardened parts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo vision and rover navigation software for planetary exploration","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035370","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22223/01035370.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22223","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Stereo vision and rover navigation software for planetary exploration","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035370/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535029","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo vision and rover navigation software for planetary exploration","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094237S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"22223","articleId":"1035370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":1035377,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

The use of COTS devices for space applications has been suggested to accelerate the development cycle and produce cost effective systems.

This vector is used, in combination with information from an inclinometer, a clock, and ephemeris data, to determine north, and to point the high gain antenna at Earth and provide a reference for the inertial measurement unit that is used for rover navigation. The Pancams, their detectors, optics, electronics, and the Sun detection/centroiding algorithm are described. The required accuracies are shown and an error budget is constructed to demonstrate that the Pancam meets these requirements.

A set of 200 circular sectors, partially overlapping and uniformly distributed over the celestial sphere, was selected as prototypes for recognition during network operation. Then, a number of candidate features was evaluated in each sector. The data have been analyzed to assess feature capability of addressing star field recognition when used as network input. Three basic statistical analyses have been performed: uniformity of distribution, feature cross-correlation, and stability. The most representative and suitable features for the considered application were selected: total number of stars, total radiant flux, four statistics of nearest neighbor angular separations in the field of view (min, max, mean and standard deviation), three second order moments of the star field image. A preliminary validation of feature selection has been performed by running a neural network.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035403","startPage":"5","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22223/01035403.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Star field feature characterization for initial acquisition by neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image analysis","Image recognition","Vector quantization","Image databases","Spatial databases","Prototypes","Data analysis","Statistical analysis","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","pattern classification","stability","correlation theory","vector quantisation","neural nets","statistical analysis","attitude control","aerospace computing","space vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["star field feature characterization","star field image features analysis","feature selection","star field recognition","initial attitude acquisition","star tracker operation","spacecraft","learning vector quantization network","LVQ networks","circular sectors","statistical analyses","feature cross-correlation analysis","distribution uniformity analysis","stability analysis","total number of stars","total radiant flux","nearest neighbor angular separations","three second order moments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-16 March 2002","displayDocTitle":"Star field feature characterization for initial acquisition by neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1035403/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","accessionNumber":"7541883","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Star field feature characterization for initial acquisition by neural networks","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054607S","chronDate":"9-16 March 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"22223","articleId":"1035403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1035405,"authors":[{"name":"V.

By permitting each site to take on any possible function in its input space (through LUT substitution) an interesting new Boolean network concept is produced. It can be viewed as an FPGA, and it can be refined in a number of ways to accommodate the addition of configuration circuitry and registration structures. The interesting features of this FPGA include its low descriptive complexity/high regularity, low interconnect demand, interchangeability of logic/routing resources, and defect tolerance. By exploiting a connection between the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of (at least) low-order LUTs and perceptron neural networks, it is relatively straightforward to model these Boolean networks with equivalent artificial neural networks, which can be trained using traditional approaches, such as the backpropagation algorithm. This paper reviews the derivation of this architecture and demonstrates examples of evolved circuit designs.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22223/01035407.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cellular automata FPGA architecture that can be trained with neural networks","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1035407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1035407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1035407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"A cellular automata FPGA architecture that can be trained with neural networks","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7541886","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035407/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cellular automata FPGA architecture that can be trained with neural networks","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1035407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088901S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"22223","articleId":"1035407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035521,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Yong Lee","affiliation":["Integrated Media Systems Center, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sang-Yong Lee","id":"37087484825"},{"name":"A.

We focus on finding off-line optimal rate control for VBR transmission with a token bucket policing function. To ensure a maximum minimum quality is obtained over all data units, we introduce a minimum maximum distortion (MMAX) criterion in this channel-constrained problem. We show that, due to the channel constraints, a MMAX solution leads to a relatively low average distortion, because the total rate budget is not completely utilized. Therefore, after finding a MMAX solution, an additional minimization of average distortion (MMAX+) criterion is proposed to increase overall quality of the data sequence by using remaining resources. The proposed algorithms lead to an increase in average quality with respect to the MMAX solution, while providing a much more constant quality than MMSE solutions. Moreover we show how the MMAX+ approach can be implemented with low complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Bit rate","Quality of service","Delay","Electric variables control","Bandwidth","Decoding","Signal processing","Image processing","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","minimax techniques","video on demand","telecommunication control","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal rate control","video transmission","VBR channels","hybrid MMAX/MMSE criterion","variable bit rate channels","off-line optimal rate control","token bucket policing function","maximum minimum quality","minimum maximum distortion criterion","channel-constrained problem","channel constraints","minimization of average distortion criterion","MMAX+ criterion","quality","data sequence"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2002.1035521","startPage":"93","endPage":"96 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

A practical method recognized as the most promising one for addressing this problem is through a facial-gesture analysis of multiple views of the face. Yet, current systems for automatic facial-gesture analysis utilize mainly portrait or nearly frontal views of faces. To advance the existing technological framework upon which research on automatic facial-gesture analysis from multiple facial views can be based, we developed an automatic system as to analyze subtle changes in facial expressions based on profile-contour reference points in a profile-view video. A probabilistic classification method based on statistical modeling of the color and motion properties of the profile in the scene is proposed for tracking the profile face. From the segmented profile face, we extract the profile contour and from it, we extract 10 profile-contour reference points. Based on these, 20 individual facial muscle actions occurring alone or in a combination are recognized by a rule-based method. A recognition rate of 85% is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2002.1035712","startPage":"37","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Unlike wired packet switched networks that suffer from congestion related loss and delay, the wireless networks have to deal with a time varying, error prone, physical channel that in many instances is also severely bandwidth constrained. As such, the solutions needed for wireless video streaming applications are fundamentally different from wired streaming. In this paper, we propose a set of end to end application layer techniques for adaptive video streaming over wireless networks. The adaptation is done both with respect to channel and data. Our approach combines the flexibility and programmability of application layer adaptations, with low delay and bandwidth efficiency of link layer techniques. Socket level simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The proposed method is based on the design and the implementation of integer wavelets. Instead of using the lifting scheme or sacrificing vanishing moment to obtain integer coefficients, the proposed method derives integer coefficients directly from roots of the half band filter. Based on the integer filter coefficients, we propose an efficient VLSI algorithm, which uses only 17 integer adders and 15 shifters to construct a two-channel filter bank system. The complexity of the proposed method is significantly lower than that found in the convolution and lifting approaches. The convolution approach requires 9 floating-point multiplications and 14 floating-point additions. Likewise, the lifting scheme needs 6 floating-point multiplications and 12 floating-point additions. Besides the mathematical derivation, this paper presents simulation results, which compare the frequency responses and coding efficiency between the floating-point and the integer approaches. In addition, a VHDL implementation result is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2002.1035783","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

We define a measure for video reconstruction error (VRE), and use VRE to evaluate the representational quality of the selected key frames. The algorithm uses a heap-based greedy algorithm to build a hierarchy of increasingly sparsely sampled temporal sequences, each consisting of key frames with minimal VRE. By exploiting the heap and a novel computation technique of \"forward computing\", the complete hierarchy is constructed in O(nlog(n)) time and O(n) space. The algorithm also ranks all frames according to their importance in recovering the original video, potentially useful for applications in temporally scalable video coding and video streaming. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms other existing methods in VRE, as compared via peak signal-noise ratio, in computation time and in guaranteed convergence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Aug. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035806/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7540660","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient error-minimizing algorithm for variable-rate temporal video sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient error-minimizing algorithm for variable-rate temporal video sampling","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1035806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041643S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8044","isNumber":"22221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8044","xplore-issue":"22221","articleId":"1035806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1035879,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The calibration is executed by adjusting variable capacitance in each pixel to make the sensor signals of all pixels the same. The calibration control circuit selects the pixels in parallel, and calibrates all pixels in a short time. The scheme was applied to a fingerprint sensor LSI using the 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS process/sensor process, and clear fingerprint images were obtained even for a degraded surface condition.

A current-mode architecture is used in order to address the main issues posed by the low supply, but the implementation of the operational amplifier and of dedicated startup circuits deserves some attention. Even if nonstandard devices such as depletion-mode MOS transistors may be helpful to manage the supply scaling, they are seldom available and poorly characterized. Therefore, they must be avoided in a robust design featuring a high portability. This paper proposes some circuit solutions suitable for very low-supply-voltage operation and addresses the main issues of achieving the correct bias point at the power on.

First, a modified matched filter (MF) is applied to remove maternal cardiac interference; then, a simple signal space projection (SSP) is applied to remove noise. The key difference between our MF and a conventional one is that the interference template and the template scaling are derived from a signal that has been spatially filtered to isolate the interference, rather than from the raw signal. Unlike conventional MFs, ours is able to separate maternal and fetal cardiac complexes, even when they have similar morphology and overlap strongly. When followed by a SSP that preserves only the signal subspace, the noise is reduced to a low level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035973/","volume":"49","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1035973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7416131","pubMedId":"12374348","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Matched-filter template generation via spatial filtering: application to fetal biomagnetic recordings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched-filter template generation via spatial filtering: application to fetal biomagnetic recordings","sourcePdf":"01035973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09086S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"22228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"22228","articleId":"1035973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1035992,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Using only asymmetric optical couplers, with a suitable power coupling ratio, it is shown that it is possible to optically implement Mallat's pyramidal decomposition scheme with a compactly supported wavelet basis function. The case of a serial input has a larger number of potential applications to optical communications systems or optical computing, and simple passive optical networks are presented that evaluate the DFT or the wavelet transform of a stream of optical digits, by using only Mach-Zehnder interferometers with output asymmetric couplers. In particular, an all-optical implementation of the WP-division demultiplexer for a waveform coded transmission system is given. The proposed networks are full-wavelength demultiplexers, as they split the spectrum of the incoming signal into a set of closed frequency channels; the filters have identical bandwidth and span the whole input spectrum. Using the WP-decomposition method, different subband filtering schemes can be designed, fabricating trees of quadrature mirror filters with the fiber or the integrated optics technology.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2002.802974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2002.802974","endPage":"1427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/22229/01035992.pdf","startPage":"1420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber wavelet filters [and planar waveguide couplers for full-wavelength demultiplexers]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1035992/","displayDocTitle":"Fiber wavelet filters [and planar waveguide couplers for full-wavelength demultiplexers]","volume":"38","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"7407513","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1035992/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber wavelet filters [and planar waveguide couplers for full-wavelength demultiplexers]","sourcePdf":"01035992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08092S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"22229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"22229","articleId":"1035992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1036007,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This model can be used to understand what information on geometric and dielectric properties of a building can be extracted from microwave remote sensing data. The geometrical model consists of a rectangular parallelepiped whose vertical walls form a generic angle with respect to the sensor line of flight. The parallelepiped is placed on a rough surface. The radar return from such a structure can be decomposed into single-scattering contributions from the (rough) ground, the building roof (a plane surface in our model), and vertical walls and multiple scattering contributions from dihedral structures formed by vertical walls and ground. In our model, single-scattering contributions are evaluated by using either physical optics (PO) or geometrical optics (GO), depending on surface roughness. In order to account for multiple scattering between buildings and terrain, we use GO to evaluate the field reflected by the smooth wall toward the ground (first bounce) or the sensor (second or third bounce) and GO or PO (according to ground surface roughness) to evaluate the field scattered by the ground toward the wall (first or second bounce) or the sensor (second bounce). Finally, the above model is used to analyze the field backscattered from a building as a function of the main scene parameters; in particular, the angle between vertical walls and sensor line of night and the dependence on the look angle are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2002.802459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/22230/01036007.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2002.802459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"A canonical problem in electromagnetic backscattering from buildings","volume":"40","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036007/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7416290","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036007/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A canonical problem in electromagnetic backscattering from buildings","sourcePdf":"01036007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052415S","chronDate":"Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"22230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"22230","articleId":"1036007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-20"},{"_id":1036009,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The method is based on nonlinear least squares fits of asymmetric Gaussian model functions to the time-series. The smooth model functions are then used for defining key seasonality parameters, such as the number of growing seasons, the beginning and end of the seasons, and the rates of growth and decline. The method is implemented in a computer program TIMESAT and tested on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data over Africa. Ancillary cloud data [clouds from AVHRR (CLAVR)] are used as estimates of the uncertainty levels of the data values. Being general in nature, the proposed method can be applied also to new types of satellite-derived time-series data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/22230/01036010.pdf","startPage":"1824","endPage":"1832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2002.802519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2002.802519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seasonality extraction by function fitting to time-series of satellite sensor data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Vegetation","Satellite broadcasting","Clouds","Radiometry","Land surface","Sea surface","Least squares methods","Testing","Africa"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series","vegetation mapping","least squares approximations","Gaussian processes","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seasonality extraction","function fitting","time-series","satellite sensor data","seasonality information","nonlinear least squares fits","asymmetric Gaussian model functions","growing seasons","TIMESAT","Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data","AVHRR data","normalized difference vegetation index","NDVI data","Africa","Ancillary cloud data","clouds from AVHRR","CLAVR","satellite-derived time series data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Seasonality extraction by function fitting to time-series of satellite sensor data","volume":"40","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1036010/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7416293","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seasonality extraction by function fitting to time-series of satellite sensor data","sourcePdf":"01036010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089464S","chronDate":"Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"22230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"742","xplore-issue":"22230","articleId":"1036010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1036012,"authors":[{"name":"J.

They obtain data almost exclusively from the so-called surface Web, which consists, loosely speaking, of interlinked HTML pages. The deep Web, by contrast, is information that is reachable over the Web, but that resides in databases; it is dynamically available in response to queries, not placed on static pages ahead of time. Recent estimates indicate that the deep Web has hundreds of times more data than the surface Web. The deep Web gives us reason to rethink much of the current doctrine of broad-based link analysis. Instead of looking up pages and finding links on them, Web crawlers would have to produce queries to generate relevant pages. Creating appropriate queries ahead of time is nontrivial without understanding the content of the queried sites. The deep Web's scale would also make it much harder to cache results than to merely index static pages. Whereas a static page presents its links for all to see, a deep Web site can decide whose queries to process and how well. It can, for example, authenticate the querying party before giving it any truly valuable information and links.

The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods, a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method, a number of variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000) .

The weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first. Geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes: global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the StirMark attack. An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark, invariant properties of transforms, template insertion, or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter, a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression, geometrical attack and transformations. Results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations. Finally, in our concluding remarks, we analyze the different perspectives of such content-based watermarking scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2002.801587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/22235/01036050.pdf","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2002.801587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1036050/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7418093","pubMedId":"18249723","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points","sourcePdf":"01036050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110441S","chronDate":"Sept.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"22235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"328","xplore-issue":"22235","articleId":"1036050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1036051,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We first develop a method to estimate user mobility based on an aggregate history of hand-offs observed in each cell. This method is then used to probabilistically predict mobiles' directions and hand-off times in a cell. For each cell, the bandwidth to be reserved for hand-offs is calculated by estimating the total sum of tractional bandwidths of the expected hand-offs within a mobility-estimation time window. Three different admission-control schemes for new connection requests using this bandwidth reservation are proposed. We also consider variations that utilize the path/location information available from the car navigation system or global positioning system.

We investigate the role of pricing as an additional dimension of the call admission control process in order to efficiently and effectively control the use of wireless network resources. First, we prove that, for a given wireless network, there exists a new call arrival rate which can maximize the total utility of users while maintaining the required QoS. Based on this result and observation, we propose an integrated pricing and call admission control scheme where the price is adjusted dynamically based on the current network conditions in order to alleviate the problem of congestion. Our proposed integrated approach implicitly implements a distributed user-based prioritization mechanism by providing negative incentives according to the current network conditions and therefore shaping the aggregate traffic in the network. We compare the performance of our approach in terms of congestion prevention, achievable total user utility, and obtained revenue, with the corresponding results of conventional systems where pricing is not taken into consideration in the call admission control process. These performance results verify the considerable improvement that can be achieved by the integration of pricing in the call admission control process in cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2002.1036064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/22233/01036064.pdf","startPage":"898","endPage":"910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2002.1036064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of pricing with call admission control to meet QoS requirements in cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036064/","displayDocTitle":"Integration of pricing with call admission control to meet QoS requirements in cellular networks","volume":"13","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7401632","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036064/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of pricing with call admission control to meet QoS requirements in cellular networks","sourcePdf":"01036064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072131S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"22233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"22233","articleId":"1036064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1036066,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The LEACH protocol presented by Heinzelman et al. (2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called PEGASIS (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In PEGASIS, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that PEGASIS performs better than LEACH. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy /spl times/ delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy /spl times/ delay using CDMA and non-CDMA sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, LEACH, and our schemes with respect to energy /spl times/ delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes. Results show that our schemes perform 80 or more times better than the direct scheme and also outperform the LEACH protocol.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/22233/01036066.pdf","startPage":"924","endPage":"935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data gathering algorithms in sensor networks using energy metrics","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2002.1036066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2002.1036066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","displayDocTitle":"Data gathering algorithms in sensor networks using energy metrics","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","accessionNumber":"7401634","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1036066/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data gathering algorithms in sensor networks using energy metrics","sourcePdf":"01036066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136907S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"22233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"751","xplore-issue":"22233","articleId":"1036066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":1036068,"authors":[{"name":"A.Y.

The objective in this work is to gauge how well a GA-based channel borrower performs when compared to a greedy borrowing heuristic. This is needed to establish how suited GA-like (stochastic search) algorithms are for the solution of optimization problems in mobile computing environments. This involves the creation of a simple mobile networking resource environment and design of a GA-based channel borrower that works within this environment. A simulation environment is also built to compare the performance of the GA-based channel-borrowing method with the heuristic. To enhance the performance of the GA, extra attention is paid to developing an improved mutation operator. The performance of the new operator is evaluated against the heuristic borrowing scheme. For a real-time implementation, the GA needs to have the properties of a micro GA strategy. This involves making improvements to the crossover operator and evaluation procedure so the GA can converge to a \"good\" solution rapidly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7401636","volume":"13","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/1036068/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Observations on using genetic-algorithms for channel allocation in mobile computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observations on using genetic-algorithms for channel allocation in mobile computing","sourcePdf":"01036068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074139S","chronDate":"Sep 2002","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"22233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"22233","articleId":"1036068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1036084,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, these technologies have not specifically focused on the ability to predict the future condition (prognostics) of a machine based on the current diagnostic state of the machinery and its available operating and failure history data. An advanced prognostic capability is desired because the ability to forecast this future condition enables a higher level of condition-based maintenance for optimally managing total life cycle costs (LCC).

Autonomic Logistics is, simply put, the automation of the logistics environment such that little human intervention is needed to engage the logistics cycle. Actions that will be automated within the JSF supportability concept include maintenance scheduling, flight scheduling, ordering spare parts, and the like. The cornerstone of Autonomic Logistics is an advanced diagnostic and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system. The PHM provides the data, information, and knowledge for initiating the AutoLog chain of events. PHM is the ability of the aircraft to do fault detection (FD), fault isolation (FI), and accommodation real-time on-board the aircraft. Along with this FD/FI capability, some of the other facets of PHM include fault prediction on selected components. parts life usage tracking, fault filtering and reporting, and recommended action to the pilot only when action is necessary. It is intended that in most cases, maintenance actions and lifing decisions will be based on the actual material condition of the equipment components. The proposed architecture of this PHM concept includes a hierarchical approach where data begins at the sensor level and is transported up to area reasoners that turns this data into information about a particular subsystem. From the area reasoner, the information is then passed up to a top level Air Vehicle Reasoner where subsystem information is then fused to give knowledge about the health of the entire air vehicle. Additionally, many of the technologies that are being developed for the JSF PHM suite could be applied to legacy aircraft and would show significant benefits in respect to LCC and maintainability issues. In many cases, the capability of PHM sensors and prognostic technologies will enable the ability to \"see\" incipient faults in subsystem components very early prior to their progressing to final system failure. These capabilities will enable accurate useful life remaining predictions and more aggressive health management of assets. Through very accurate tracking of the life usage data for component parts, the JSF PHM and AL will be able to anticipate many problems that plague current legacy aircraft; giving a lead time to provide fixes before the actual problems become fleet wide and catastrophic. The PHM architecture will directly interface with the Joint Distributed Information System (JDIS), the information system that will enable Autonomic Logistics functions. The JDIS could automatically forward to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) data on problems that arise within the fleet, thus alerting them to a developing situation sooner, and enabling them to provide faster, cheaper fixes to these problems. With these safeguards in place, the JSF will put itself in a position to quickly react to ageing aircraft problems, increase sortie generation rates, decrease mean time to diagnose faults and failures as well as drastically decrease maintenance costs.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1036144","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22236/01036144.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1036144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) PHM concept: Potential impact on aging aircraft problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) PHM concept: Potential impact on aging aircraft problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1036144/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535079","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) PHM concept: Potential impact on aging aircraft problems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1036144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030264S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"22236","articleId":"1036144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1036165,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This demonstrates the necessity of having very low broadband background noise associated with the pump source.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.2002.1036251","publicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","displayPublicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel5/8042/22213/01036251.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"127","doi":"10.1109/OFC.2002.1036251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous wave parametric amplifier with 27 dB gain and low noise figure pumped with a frequency-modulated source","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","displayDocTitle":"Continuous wave parametric amplifier with 27 dB gain and low noise figure pumped with a frequency-modulated source","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1036251/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7574351","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous wave parametric amplifier with 27 dB gain and low noise figure pumped with a frequency-modulated source","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038267S","chronDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1036252,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The results clearly show that a multiwavelength laser source is needed for high data rate FFH-OCDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.2002.1036335","publicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","displayPublicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel5/8042/22213/01036335.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.2002.1036335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelength 'single-mode' erbium doped fiber laser for FFH-OCDMA testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 March 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036335/","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelength 'single-mode' erbium doped fiber laser for FFH-OCDMA testing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7574411","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036335/","conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelength 'single-mode' erbium doped fiber laser for FFH-OCDMA testing","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03272S","chronDate":"17-22 March 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1036346,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This experiment demonstrates for the first time the industrial feasibility of a 1.5 Tbit/s regional network transmission which is compatible with 0.4 (bit/s)/Hz. The use of NRZ format has two advantages. The first one is a low cost and compact terminal equipment due to less modulation stages compared to RZ or CRZ.

We have proposed a novel optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique that can overcome the spectral efficiency limitation of the conventional WDM system. This scheme permits substantial overlapping of the spectrum and can achieve the spectral efficiency up to 1 bit/s/Hz in principle. For demultiplexing, we used a newly developed optical discrete Fourier transformer (DFT) instead of electrical digital processing, which is impossible to apply in the optical frequency range. The optical DFT was realized by using a set of delay lines, a phase shifter and a coupler in the frequency domain and bit synchronization and an optical gate in the time domain. In experimental demonstration of this scheme, error-free operation was obtained with a 0.8 bit/s/Hz of spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/OFC.2002.1036444","publicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","displayPublicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel5/8042/22213/01036444.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.2002.1036444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing using frequency/time domain filtering for high spectral efficiency up to 1 bit/s/Hz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 March 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036444/","displayDocTitle":"Optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing using frequency/time domain filtering for high spectral efficiency up to 1 bit/s/Hz","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7581597","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036444/","conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing using frequency/time domain filtering for high spectral efficiency up to 1 bit/s/Hz","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036814S","chronDate":"17-22 March 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1036445,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A complete evaluation of the BER performance of all the 16 channels in the system is obtained. The experiments also demonstrated that error free performance can be obtained for a distance of 50 km of transmission without any complicated dispersion compensation or some means of nonlinear filtering at the receiver. These results highlight that the SSFBG approach provides an extremely powerful and flexible way of performing many of the elementary optical processing functions required within both OCDMA and packet-switched networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel5/8042/22213/01036588.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"601","publicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","doi":"10.1109/OFC.2002.1036588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.2002.1036588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16-channel OCDMA system (4 OCDM /spl times/ 4 WDM) based on 16-chip, 20 Gchip/s superstructure fibre Bragg gratings and DFB fibre laser transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Code division multiplexing","Wavelength division multiplexing","Fiber gratings","Bragg gratings","Fiber lasers","Optical transmitters","Optical filters","Optical receivers","Decoding","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication channels","code division multiple access","Bragg gratings","encoding","decoding","error statistics","optical transmitters","fibre lasers","distributed feedback lasers","wavelength division multiplexing","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["16-channel OCDMA system","WDM","superstructure fibre Bragg gratings","DFB fibre laser transmitters","coding/decoding approach","16-channel OCDMA/WDM system","BER performance","error free performance","elementary optical processing functions","packet-switched networks","OCDMA networks","50 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 March 2002","displayDocTitle":"A 16-channel OCDMA system (4 OCDM /spl times/ 4 WDM) based on 16-chip, 20 Gchip/s superstructure fibre Bragg gratings and DFB fibre laser transmitters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036588/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7591341","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16-channel OCDMA system (4 OCDM /spl times/ 4 WDM) based on 16-chip, 20 Gchip/s superstructure fibre Bragg gratings and DFB fibre laser transmitters","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039682S","chronDate":"17-22 March 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1036594,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A time-domain model was capable of describing the dynamics of the Raman amplifiers. Applying the model, we have constructed an effective transient control algorithm for distributed or lumped Raman amplifiers based only on output power monitoring. In an experiment, the control algorithm held gain fluctuations of surviving channels to less than =0.02 dB. The double Rayleigh backscattering noise was quantified by observing the pedestals at the Raman amplifiers outputs.

effect of localized loss in fiber transmission line on DFRA has been examined using computer simulation based on the measured Raman gain coefficient. The output power level of DFRA strongly depended not only on the position of localized loss but also on the loss level. The impact was most serious when the loss point was close to the signal output side in OLA site. Therefore, it is necessary to measure OTDR trace of the transmission line to figure out the loss distribution before DFRA design or deployment. However, the Raman gain profile of DFRA can be made robust against loss change simply by balancing the C/L-band output power as long as the localized loss is outside the effective length of pump. This fact provides DFRA with design flexibility and allows the use of a fixed gain flattening filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1036616/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7581719","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of localized loss on distributed fiber Raman amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of localized loss on distributed fiber Raman amplifiers","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033425S","chronDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1036619,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Equivalently, two identical AWG's could be interconnected back-to-back to generate the same functionality in transmission. The output temporal profile is determined by the autoconvolution of the temporal profile of an output channel in single-pass. This scheme shows promise for manipulating ultrafast optical waveforms via hybrid WDM/TDM optical processing. For example, with further engineering of the AWG structure, it may be possible to generate continuous very-high repetition rate pulse trains, as would be desired for a repetition-rate multiplication scheme of a lower-rate source.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of high repetition rate pulse bursts via femtosecond readout of a double-passed arrayed waveguide grating","publicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","doi":"10.1109/OFC.2002.1036633","displayPublicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel5/8042/22213/01036633.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.2002.1036633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","displayDocTitle":"Generation of high repetition rate pulse bursts via femtosecond readout of a double-passed arrayed waveguide grating","conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036633/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7596735","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of high repetition rate pulse bursts via femtosecond readout of a double-passed arrayed waveguide grating","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040821S","chronDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1036650,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The carrier suppression ratio of /spl sim/35 dB was achieved, which showed a great potential for all-optical 3R regeneration of CS-RZ data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1036677/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7596770","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"All-optical carrier-suppressed pulse generator by a single semiconductor optical amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical carrier-suppressed pulse generator by a single semiconductor optical amplifier","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA","sourcePdf":"1036677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032363S","chronDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1036680,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Wan Ryu","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang-Wan Ryu","id":"37086986272"},{"name":"Sung-Bock Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Bock Kim","id":"37087161067"},{"name":"Jae-Sik Sim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae-Sik Sim","id":"37087160928"},{"name":"Jeha Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jeha Kim","id":"37087160508"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-55752-701-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1036680","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric sampled grating laser diode for a multi-wavelength laser array","abstract":"We proposed an asymmetric sampled grating laser for an MLA.

The specific BSS method considered provides an approximate optimal solution (in the maximum-likelihood sense) for the case of two channels, and has a computational cost of O(N/sup 5/2/ L) when processing L-sample blocks of an N-channel WDM signal. For the signal distributions typically occurring in WDM monitoring, the method presents no undesired solutions. In addition, the case of spectrally white channels can also be handled, thus allowing beneficial reductions in the rates at which the photocurrents are sampled. Although the suggested procedure operates on signal blocks (batch processing), fast adaptive implementations can easily be designed as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","pdfPath":"/iel5/8042/22213/01036691.pdf","startPage":"746","endPage":"748","publicationTitle":"Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibit","doi":"10.1109/OFC.2002.1036691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OFC.2002.1036691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WDM monitoring through blind signal separation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Blind source separation","Signal processing","Condition monitoring","Optical fiber networks","Baseband","Higher order statistics","Computational efficiency","Photoconductivity","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","monitoring","telecommunication channels","optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WDM monitoring","blind signal separation","optical networks","electronic domain","baseband channels","approximate optimal solution","maximum-likelihood","N-channel WDM signal","photocurrents","signal blocks","batch processing","fast adaptive implementations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","displayDocTitle":"WDM monitoring through blind signal separation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036691/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7596784","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2003","conferenceDate":"17-22 March 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WDM monitoring through blind signal separation","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1036691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039024S","chronDate":"17-22 Mar 2002","xplore-pub-id":"8042","isNumber":"22213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8042","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"22213","articleId":"1036691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Optical Society of America","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1036744,"authors":[{"name":"P.W.

The proposed method is discrete in nature and can therefore be readily implemented on a digital signal processor. The method is also readily extendable to any number of voltage levels.

However, in some operating conditions, a low-frequency ripple appears in the neutral-point potential and its frequency is three times that of the output voltages. As a result, the output voltages also have low-frequency distortion, which includes even and odd multiples of the fundamental. In this paper, a new space-vector pulsewidth-modulation strategy is presented to avoid that low-frequency output voltage distortion. This modulation method tries to balance the voltages of the capacitors by using only three vectors per modulation cycle. The duty ratios are directly calculated from the space-vector diagram, even when balance is not achieved. For all cases, the result is a balanced set of three AC output voltages. Some simulated and experimental results are given to validate the method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2002.803207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/22237/01036797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2002.803207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22237","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New feedforward space-vector PWM method to obtain balanced AC output voltages in a three-level neutral-point-clamped converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New feedforward space-vector PWM method to obtain balanced AC output voltages in a three-level neutral-point-clamped converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7413696","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1036797/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New feedforward space-vector PWM method to obtain balanced AC output voltages in a three-level neutral-point-clamped converter","sourcePdf":"01036797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071684S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"22237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"22237","articleId":"1036797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1036798,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This results in the average current injection and hence the net power drawn from the multiple DC bus terminals to be unmatched and time varying. Subsequently, the DC-bus voltages are unregulated, requiring corrective control action to incorporated. In this paper, the principle of reciprocity transposition in introduced as a means for modeling the DC-bus current injection simultaneously as the modulation strategy is formulated. Furthermore, a new sinusoidal pulsewidth-modulation strategy that features constant and controllable current injection at the DC-bus terminals while maintaining output voltage waveform quality is introduced. The proposed strategy is general enough to be applied to converters with an even number of levels and an odd number of levels. Analytical results comparing the performance of the proposed modulator with a conventional multiple carrier modulator are presented for example multilevel converters with four and five levels.

The DC links of the full bridges are supplied by individual DC-DC isolation stages which are arranged in parallel concerning the dc input of the. total system. Therefore, all switching cells of the proposed converter can be equipped with modern low-voltage high-current power MOSFETs, which results in an improved efficiency as compared to conventional isolated DC-AC converters. Furthermore, the cells are operated in an interleaved pulsewidth-modulation mode which, in connection with the low voltage level of each cell, significantly reduces the filtering effort on the AC output of the overall system. The paper describes the operating principle, analyzes the fundamental relationships which are relevant for component selection, and presents a specific circuit design.

In keeping with the need to implement very-high-power inverters, switching frequency is restricted to line frequency. The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented. It is found that the chain converter is attractive for the implementation of a static compensator or a static synchronous series compensator. The MPC converter is attractive for the implementation of a unified power flow controller or an interline power flow controller, but a special arrangement is required to overcome the limitations on voltage control.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2002.803217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/22237/01036802.pdf","startPage":"1072","endPage":"1080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2002.803217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of high-power converter topologies for the implementation of FACTS controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036802/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of high-power converter topologies for the implementation of FACTS controllers","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7413701","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036802/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of high-power converter topologies for the implementation of FACTS controllers","sourcePdf":"01036802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053191S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"22237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"22237","articleId":"1036802","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1036804,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A GTO chopper is used to provide controlled electrical braking in case of line loss. The paper presents the requirements and alternatives for the drive system and the control strategies for the converters and the belt. A novel application of the selective harmonic elimination method is used to reduce the input current harmonics. Special attention is dedicated to the interaction with the electrical network. The most relevant features of the system are: (1) fuseless operation; (2) adjustable power factor; (3) reduced input current harmonics; (4) smooth transition between motoring and regenerating modes; and (5) 15 MW of regenerated power with more than six months of successful operation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/22237/01036804.pdf","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1100","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2002.803223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2002.803223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel 20-MW downhill conveyor system using three-level converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Belts","Inverters","Ores","Control systems","Copper","Thyristors","Induction generators","Power generation","Torque control","Choppers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mining","conveyors","thyristor convertors","DC-AC power convertors","invertors","choppers (circuits)","power conversion harmonics","harmonic distortion","harmonics suppression","AC motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downhill conveyor system","three-level GTO invertors","ore transportation drive system","three-level active front end","selective harmonic elimination method","input current harmonies","fuseless operation","adjustable power factor","input current harmonics reduction","regenerating mode","motoring mode","20 MW","2500 kW","15 MW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","displayDocTitle":"Novel 20-MW downhill conveyor system using three-level converters","volume":"49","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1036804/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7413703","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel 20-MW downhill conveyor system using three-level converters","sourcePdf":"01036804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089781S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"22237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"22237","articleId":"1036804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1036805,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.T.

This binary pulse sequence can be digitally processed exploiting the similarity between Boolean algebra and statistical algebra. Given a random pulse sequence, any Boolean operation among individual pulses will correspond to an algebraic expression among the variables represented by their respective average pulse rates. Subsequently, this pulse stream can be digitally processed to perform analog operations. In this paper, we propose a stochastic approach to the digital implementation of complex controllers using programmable devices as an alternative to traditional digital signal processors. As an example, a practical realization of nonlinear dissipative controllers for a series resonant converter is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Random number generation","Stochastic resonance","Arithmetic","Field programmable analog arrays","Logic","Probability","Very large scale integration","Analog integrated circuits","Boolean algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant power convertors","stochastic processes","Boolean algebra","programmable logic arrays","nonlinear control systems","DC-DC power convertors","binary sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital stochastic realization","complex analog controllers","stochastic logic","random pulse stream","finite sequence","binary pulse sequence","Boolean algebra","statistical algebra","random pulse sequence","Boolean operation","average pulse rates","pulse stream","stochastic approach","programmable devices","nonlinear dissipative controllers","series resonant converter","parallel resonant DC-to-DC converters","series resonant DC-to-DC converters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2002.803233","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/22237/01036805.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2002.803233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital stochastic realization of complex analog controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital stochastic realization of complex analog controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036805/","volume":"49","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036805/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7413704","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital stochastic realization of complex analog controllers","sourcePdf":"01036805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061231S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"22237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"22237","articleId":"1036805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":1036807,"authors":[{"name":"Eun-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Jeonju University, Jeonju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/22237/1036807/1036807-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eun-Soo Kim (M'01) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1986, 1988, and 2000, respectively.","From 1989 to 2001, he was a Senior Researcher in the Power Electronics Research Division, Korea Electro-technology Research Institute (KERI).

However, the hypotheses in target detection applications are usually composite, because, as a rule, the models are only partially known. A major method traditionally used for testing composite hypotheses is based on a generalized likelihood ratio. However, the generalized SPRT suffers from a crucial drawback - it is very difficult to select thresholds in order to guarantee prescribed levels of false alarms and missed detections. We consider an adaptive approach that allows us to overcome this problem. At each stage, unknown parameters are replaced with an estimator which is based on previous observations, but not on the current observation. It is shown that the adaptive test is uniformly asymptotically optimal in the sense that it minimizes the average sample size for all parameter values when probabilities of errors are small. The general results are applied to the problem of detecting a target with unknown intensity in clutter with unknown variance.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1036875","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22239/01036875.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1036875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient adaptive sequential procedure for detecting targets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036875/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient adaptive sequential procedure for detecting targets","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7534994","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1036875/","conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient adaptive sequential procedure for detecting targets","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1036875.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153236S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"22239","articleId":"1036875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1036910,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper proposes a solution to a related problem for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Spacecraft (GOES-8) image data processing and color picture generation (GOES-8 application). The proposed solution is based on a PC platform and synergy of optimized software algorithms and reconfigurable computing hardware (RC) technologies, such as FPGA and DSP. The solution involved porting the GOES-8 application from its Silicon Graphics Inc Workstation/UNIX platform, making minor platform specific changes to the GOES-8 application so that it runs on the PC, benchmarking the various code segments, and implementing the most computing intensive functions in hardware. After pre-hardware optimization steps in the PC environment, the necessity for RC hardware implementation for bottleneck code became more evident. The problem was solved beginning with the methodology described by T. Flatley (AIST-0132-0000, 1999), M. Figueiredo et al (IEEE Comp. Mag., pp. 115-118, 1999), and S. Kizhner (Proc. ION GPS'2000), and implementing a novel methodology for this application. The PC-RC interface bandwidth problem for the class of applications with moderate input-output data rates but large intermediate multi source data streams has been addressed and mitigated. This opens a new class of satellite image processing applications for bottleneck problem solution using RC technologies. The issue of a science algorithm level of abstraction necessary for RC hardware implementation is also described. Selected software functions already implemented in hardware were investigated for applicability in order to create a library of RC functions for ongoing work. A complete class of spacecraft image processing applications development using reconfigurable computing technology to meet real-time requirements, including methodology, performance results and comparison with the existing system, is described in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2002.1036910","publicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings, IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8043/22239/01036910.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2002.1036910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22239","startPage":"4","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-hardware optimization of spacecraft image processing software algorithms and hardware implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1036910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pre-hardware optimization of spacecraft image processing software algorithms and hardware implementation","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1036910/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-16 March 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535024","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2003","htmlLink":"/document/1036910/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-hardware optimization of spacecraft image processing software algorithms and hardware implementation","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"1036910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076552S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8043","isNumber":"22239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8043","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"22239","articleId":"1036910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1036912,"authors":[{"name":"E.-S.

The multiobjective PID control considers a set of frequency-domain performance requirements, such as gain margin, phase margin, crossover frequency and steady-state error. The multiobjective critical control addresses the robust control design of multivariable critical systems with external and internal uncertainties. The design problem formulated as a set of objectives includes the output performance criteria in the time domain and the robust performance criterion in the frequency domain. The multiobjective eigenstructure assignment studies robust eigenstructure assignment with multiobjective criteria for multivariable control systems. Various performance functions in the objectives that are taken into account are individual eigenvalue sensitivity functions and the system robustness functions. Based on those above performance functions, the performance criteria for each multiobjective scheme are expressed by a set of inequalities.

The library has been developed by the authors with the intent of giving to the Simulink user an easy access to a variety of adaptive approximators. The neural networks contained in the library are ready to be used and interchanged within the user's application. Different from existing neural network collections and toolboxes, in this library, a neural network is strictly treated as a dynamic system with its inputs, outputs and states, and the \"dynamics\" of the approximation process are therefore considered as an essential part of this \"system\". The library is introduced and the featured network architectures are analyzed in detail. Finally, as an example, a comparison is performed between two of the presented networks.","doi":"10.1109/CACSD.2002.1036939","startPage":"115","endPage":"120","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The system is capable of image acquisition at rates of up to 1,400 frames/sec. After describing the DPS chip and experimental imaging system,we present two applications: dynamic range extension and optical flow estimation.

With this method, 3D arbitrary-view images can be synthesized from array of input images. However, most of the current research is concentrated on static scenes because of the difficulty of handling a large amount of multiple video inputs. The authors adopt a random access image sensor for the camera array. In our system, each sensor outputs only the pixels that are externally selected, so that the total readout data from the camera array is reduced to that necessary and sufficient for the rendering. We designed and implemented the pixel based random access image sensor with 0.8 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. We implemented a camera array system with sixteen of the prototype devices. In this paper, we present our design of the random access CMOS image sensors and the construction of the camera array system. Evaluation of the prototype sensor and the results of the arbitrary-view synthesis are also described.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pixel based random access image sensor array for real-time IBR","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037004","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22242/01037004.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"139 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Pixel based random access image sensor array for real-time IBR","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1037004/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7522484","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pixel based random access image sensor array for real-time IBR","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060945S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22242","articleId":"1037004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1037011,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

CMOS sensors boast low power dissipation, single supply operation and camera-on-a-chip integration, and CCD sensors boast high sensitivity and low noise. The sensors are based on inherently similar technologies (silicon photodetectors and CMOS read-out electronics); therefore one would expect they share the same fundamental limits. We analyze CMOS and CCD detector systems from the architecture down to the sensitivity of the pixel and read-out electronics. Our analysis shows that for low resolution imaging (VGA and below) CCD and CMOS sensor technologies are converging to practically indistinguishable solutions in terms of performance, size and cost.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037011","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22242/01037011.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22242","startPage":"171","endPage":"176 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of modern CCD and CMOS image sensor technologies and systems for low resolution imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of modern CCD and CMOS image sensor technologies and systems for low resolution imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037011/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7522491","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037011/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of modern CCD and CMOS image sensor technologies and systems for low resolution imaging","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039699S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"22242","articleId":"1037011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1037020,"authors":[{"name":"T.

When the proposed MCI is applied, multiple motion trajectories are considered in order to increase the accuracy of the MCI.

Since conventional frequency synchronization algorithms only estimate the frequency offset from the received pilot, synchronization can not be achieved if the pilot is severely distorted. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm compensates most of the frequency offset using the symmetry property of the ATSC signal spectrum. However, because information about the phase offset is unobtainable from the symmetry property, the estimation may still have an offset due to asymmetric channel distortion. To overcome such problems, a second step compensates the remaining frequency and phase offsets using a conventional pilot-based algorithm. As a result, the proposed algorithm increases the estimation range of the frequency offset and can achieve perfect synchronization if the transmitted pilot level is greater than 25 percent of the original level.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2002.1037049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22240","startPage":"610","endPage":"616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/22240/01037049.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency synchronization algorithm robust to pilot distortion in ATSC system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037049/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Frequency synchronization algorithm robust to pilot distortion in ATSC system","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407595","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency synchronization algorithm robust to pilot distortion in ATSC system","sourcePdf":"01037049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044517S","chronDate":"Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"22240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22240","articleId":"1037049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1037053,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, it is also well known that the switching action of the class-D amplifier is a potential source of electromagnetic interference and therefore designers of audio consumer products are naturally concerned that the adoption of this form of amplification will jeopardise the ability of their product to comply with EMC regulations. We show that when properly screened, class-D amplifiers can be used within a few inches of a sensitive AM broadcast receiver. Furthermore, the cost of the screening can be defrayed by including switched-mode power management circuits within the screened environment. This reduces the power consumption, allows the use of a single cell as a power source, and reduces the total ownership cost and the size and the weight of the product.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037060/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7407605","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Class-D amplification combined with switched-mode power conditioning-the route to long battery life","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class-D amplification combined with switched-mode power conditioning-the route to long battery life","sourcePdf":"01037060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045158S","chronDate":"Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"22240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"22240","articleId":"1037060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1037061,"authors":[{"name":"F.

McGeehan after obtaining the degrees of BEng and PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Liverpool in 1967 and 1971 respectively, held the position of Senior Scientist at the Allan Clark Research Centre, The Plessey Company Ltd. Here, he was responsible for the research and development of 2-and 3-terminal GaAs devices and their application to radar, telecommunications and ultra-fast logic (>5Gbps). In September 1972 he joined the academic staff of the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Bath, where he began research into mobile communications in 1974. At Bath, he pioneered research into what he later termed Linear Modulation for the spectrum efficient transmission of speech and data (64kbps in a 5kHz channel), ray-tracing for propagation prediction in micro-, macro-and large cells, automatic gain control and frequency tracking systems for operation in the fading environment. In 1981 he developed, with his group, what is considered to be the first basic form of what he termed the \u201cSoftware Radio\u201d a Linear Modulation radio based on TTIB using the Intel 2920 digital signal processor. On appointment to the Chair of Communications Engineering at the University of Bristol in 1985, he successfully developed, with colleagues, techniques for linearising both narrowband and broadband power amplifiers. He continued research into linear modulation techniques and systems, ray-tracing, and initiated research into the use of adaptive beam-forming techniques in cellular and AWA systems. As a result, he was the joint recipient of the IEEE Transactions Neal Shepherd Memorial Award (for work on SMART Antennas) and the IEE Proceedings Mountbatten Premium (for work on satellite tracking and frequency control systems). He also established in 1987, and is Director of, the Centre for Communications Research at Bristol which now has some 140 researchers in the fields of wireless communications, optical communications, computational electromagnetics, networks and protocols, and video and image processing. Many aspects of his research have formed the basis of international standards or equipments for the cellular, PCS or private mobile radio markets.

However, little has been reported on effective methods for integrating these structures into electronic systems for analysis and fluidic delivery. This paper describes a straightforward and versatile fabrication platform for polymer microfluidics that readily accommodates integration with silicon-based sensors, printed circuit, and surface mount technologies. In particular, we have demonstrated a novel system for distributed fluid delivery to a flexural plate wave (FPW) chemical/biological sensor where micromachined fluidic components are combined in a single package with silicon die, multilayer printed circuit board, and surface mount electronics. In the same fabrication platform, we have demonstrated temperature control of the sensor with 0.1/spl deg/C precision using integrated metal thin-film heater and sensor elements. This is an important capability for FPW sensors to compensate for temperature-induced drift. We present results for the on-board microfluidic system where the sensor is used to detect changes in the composition of the supplied fluid.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037137","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22242/01037137.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22242","startPage":"460","endPage":"465 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Si-based FPW sensor array system with polymer microfluidics integrated on a PCB","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Si-based FPW sensor array system with polymer microfluidics integrated on a PCB","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037137/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7528016","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Si-based FPW sensor array system with polymer microfluidics integrated on a PCB","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107227S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"22242","articleId":"1037137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1037181,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The cavity at the fiber end is made by wet etching in diluted HF acid. Thus the Fabry-Perot interferometer is formed between the inner fiber-cavity interface and the diaphragm. Deflection of the diaphragm and so pressure magnitude is determined by reading the reflectance spectrum of the sensing Fabry-Perot interferometer using broadband illumination. The configuration of Fabry-Perot interferometer at the optical fiber end makes sensor immune from bending of optical fiber and optical power fluctuations of light source. We deployed sensor prototype from 125 /spl mu/m-diameter optical fiber. It is optimized for human blood pressure range, namely from 0 to 40 kPa (0 to 300 mmHg) with 1 mmHg resolution.

This paper presents a review of select advances used in the fabrication of SiC MEMS and NEMS structures.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037269","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22243/01037269.pdf","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1114 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon carbide for MEMS and NEMS - an overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Silicon carbide for MEMS and NEMS - an overview","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7535135","publicationDate":"2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037269/","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon carbide for MEMS and NEMS - an overview","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121914S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"22243","articleId":"1037269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1037314,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

The system enables the determination of both: the X-Y position and the touch-point resistance. The interface uses advanced measurement techniques, including three-signal auto-calibration, synchronous detection and two-port measurement. The interface electronics has been designed to interface between the touch-screen sensor and a PC, using the Universal Serial Bus (USB) protocol. The X-Y position interface uses a very linear relaxation oscillator, which converts X-Y position and touch-point resistance signals to a period-modulated signal. A microcontroller is used to read out the modulated signal, to control the switches and to send the information to the USB interface device. The USB interface device is used to communicate between the microcontroller with any device with USB protocol, such as a PC. A phase-locked-loop is included in the USB interface to multiply from 6 MHz to 48 MHz, for the USB communication.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22243/01037318.pdf","startPage":"1360","endPage":"1363 vol.2","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast interface electronics for a resistive touch-screen","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Universal Serial Bus","Circuits","Electrical resistance measurement","Tactile sensors","Microcontrollers","Frequency","Time measurement","Voltage","Protocols","Phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["touch sensitive screens","interactive devices","peripheral interfaces","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast interface electronics","resistive touch screen","X-Y 4-wire touch screen","X-Y position","touch-point resistance","advanced measurement techniques","three-signal auto-calibration","synchronous detection","two-port measurement","touch-screen sensor","PC","Universal Serial Bus protocol","USB protocol","linear relaxation oscillator","period-modulated signal","microcontroller","phase-locked-loop","PLL","6 to 48 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Fast interface electronics for a resistive touch-screen","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1037318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535183","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast interface electronics for a resistive touch-screen","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042153S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"22243","articleId":"1037318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1037320,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungchun Lee","affiliation":["Scientific Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyungchun Lee","id":"37067039200"},{"name":"Joohwan Chun","affiliation":["Scientific Computing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joohwan Chun","id":"37272877200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-7454-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1037320","dbTime":"58 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new nulling method in the V-BLAST under uncertain channel information","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time) detection algorithm which considers the channel estimation error.

Measures performed over a prototype has been demonstrated the reliability of the approach by detecting pressure images at 3 F/s and by measuring capacitances as low as hundreds of fF spaced apart at meters of distance.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037367","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22243/01037367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22243","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1630 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A textile based capacitive pressure sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A textile based capacitive pressure sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037367/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535232","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A textile based capacitive pressure sensor","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048811S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"22243","articleId":"1037367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1037370,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

An array of electrodes has been adopted on either side of the PZT material to achieve independent resonators. The common areas sandwiched between the electrodes and excitable at the resonance frequency of the PZT material are used to form the sensitive area of the tactile sensor. The electrodes were deposited using a sputtering technique. Tactile sensors with 3/spl times/3, 7/spl times/7 and 15/spl times/15 array of electrodes are developed with different electrode dimensions and separation between the electrodes. The tactile sensor has been interfaced to a computer for the convenience of automatic scanning and making it more user interactive. The tactile sensors developed with different spatial resolution were tested for different shaped objects placed in contact with the sensor. The 3/spl times/3 matrix tactile sensor showed relatively poor spatial resolution whereas 15/spl times/15-matrix tactile sensor showed improved spatial resolution. The sensor with 7/spl times/7 matrix elements was tested for its sensitivity to different extents of applied force/pressure. The output response study carried out on the sensors indicated that these sensors can provide information not only about the extent of force/pressure applied on the object, but also the contour of the object which is in contact with the sensor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037370","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2002 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/8046/22243/01037370.pdf","startPage":"1643","endPage":"1647 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2002.1037370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tactile sensor based on piezoelectric resonance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"Tactile sensor based on piezoelectric resonance","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1037370/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7535235","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037370/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tactile sensor based on piezoelectric resonance","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1037370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074312S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8046","isNumber":"22243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8046","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"22243","articleId":"1037370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1037397,"authors":[{"name":"Nayebi","affiliation":["National Semiconductor Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Nayebi","id":"37087623805"},{"name":"Wooley","affiliation":["National Semiconductor Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wooley","id":"37087620682"}],"articleNumber":"1037397","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037397","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","MOS devices","Gain","Random access memory","Operational amplifiers","Geometry","Degradation"]}],"abstract":"A BiCMOS operational amplifier with d.c. gain of 65 dB and bandwidth of over 500 MHz is described.

In this paper, three new achievements are described. First, in half Vcc precharge approach specific combinations of memory cell reading information and operating sequence of NMOS and PMOS amps, composing the CMOS amp, cause data line interference noise during amplification.

In a small microprocessor-based computer system. high-speed DRAMS can keep up with the CPU and avoid wait states during memory accesses. This paper describes an experimental 256 K word X 4 bit CMOS DRAM with a typical RAS access time of 27 ns. In page mode operation, a typical CAS access time of 12 ns with a page cycle time of 24 ns is obtained. This performance was achieved by Strapping wordline with metal, a multiplexed sense amplifier using depletion devices, a fast boosted wordline clock and driver, half - VDD sensing without dummy cells, and segmented 1/0 lines for faster I/O seming. Unique wordline and bitline redundancy is implemented which does not adversely affect access and cycle times. Robust cell-array N-well and substrate bias generators provide low cell leakage current and improve peripheral circuit speed. Bitline margin test done by changing bitline precharge voltage enhances the testability of the memory arrays.

The technique begins with 20-ps pulses carved by a commercially available external modulator and achieves up to 15-fold compression using a combination of phase modulation and distributed Raman amplification. Unlike adiabatic soliton compression, the scheme takes advantage of an exact solution to the nonlinear Schrodinger equation for chirped soliton evolution. As such, high-quality low-pedestal compressed pulses can be produced in a shorter span of fiber than would be needed for adiabatic compression. Because the system uses external modulation, the source is inherently tunable. Furthermore, the degree of pulse compression can be adjusted by varying the amount of Raman gain and phase modulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037538/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1037538/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","accessionNumber":"7417438","volume":"14","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"10-GHz 1.3-ps pulse generation using chirped soliton compression in a Raman gain medium","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"10-GHz 1.3-ps pulse generation using chirped soliton compression in a Raman gain medium","sourcePdf":"01037538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057156S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"22248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"22248","articleId":"1037538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1037542,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Hun Kim","affiliation":["Photonics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Hun Kim","id":"37087191227"},{"name":"Young Min Jhon","affiliation":["Photonics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Min Jhon","id":"37087189532"},{"name":"Young Tae Byun","affiliation":["Photonics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young Tae Byun","id":"37087191507"},{"name":"Seok Lee","affiliation":["Photonics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seok Lee","id":"37087189640"},{"name":"Deok Ha Woo","affiliation":["Photonics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Deok Ha Woo","id":"37087359658"},{"name":"Sun Ho Kim","affiliation":["Photonics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sun Ho Kim","id":"37086965130"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"1037542","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":152,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1010},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Laser excitation","Optical interferometry","Optical modulation","Clocks","Probes","Optical pulse generation","Logic devices","Circuits","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical logic","semiconductor optical amplifiers","optical modulation","optical design techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optical amplifiers","all-optical-XOR gate","design","cross-gain modulation","Boolean logic","10 Gbit/s"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037542","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2002.801841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2002.801841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/22248/01037542.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-optical XOR gate using semiconductor optical amplifiers without additional input beam","abstract":"The novel design of an all-optical XOR gate by using cross-gain modulation of semiconductor optical amplifiers has been suggested and demonstrated successfully at 10 Gb/s.

Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine. The overview in this paper uses signal flow graphs of complex space vector quantities to provide an insightful description of the systems used in sensorless control of induction motors.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2002.800726","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/22249/01037566.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2002.800726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless control of induction motor drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037566","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037566/","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless control of induction motor drives","volume":"90","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7423972","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1037566/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless control of induction motor drives","sourcePdf":"01037566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139774S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"22249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"517","xplore-issue":"22249","articleId":"1037566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1037568,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

These MR methods have found application and permeated the literature of a widely scattered set of disciplines, and one of our principal objectives is to present a single, coherent picture of this framework. A second goal is to describe how this topic fits into the even larger field of MR methods and concepts-in particular, making ties to topics such as wavelets and multigrid methods. A third goal is to provide several alternate viewpoints for this body of work, as the methods and concepts we describe intersect with a number of other fields. The principle focus of our presentation is the class of MR Markov processes defined on pyramidally organized trees. The attractiveness of these models stems from both the very efficient algorithms they admit and their expressive power and broad applicability. We show how a variety of methods and models relate to this framework including models for self-similar and 1/f processes. We also illustrate how these methods have been used in practice.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2002.800717","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/22249/01037568.pdf","startPage":"1396","endPage":"1458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2002.800717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution Markov models for signal and image processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1037568","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1037568/","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution Markov models for signal and image processing","volume":"90","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","accessionNumber":"7423973","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1037568/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution Markov models for signal and image processing","sourcePdf":"01037568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.678697S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"22249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"22249","articleId":"1037568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1037961,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We present a novel photo retrieval system using face sketches.

It is well known that the distribution of face images, under a perceivable variation in viewpoint, illumination or facial expression, is highly nonlinear and complex. It is therefore, not surprising that linear techniques, such as those based on principle component analysis (PCA) or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) cannot provide reliable and robust solutions to those complex face recognition problems. We propose a kernel machine based discriminant analysis method, which deals with the nonlinearity of the face patterns' distribution. The proposed method also effectively solves the \"small sample size\" (SSS) problem which exists in most face recognition tasks. The new algorithm has been tested, in terms of error rate performance, on the multi-view UMIST Face Database. Results indicate that the proposed methodology outperform other commonly used approaches, such as the kernel-PCA (KPCA) and the generalized discriminant analysis (GDA).","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038010","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

By contrast, designing objective No-Reference (NR) quality measurement algorithms is a very difficult task. Currently, NR quality assessment is feasible only when prior knowledge about the types of image distortion is available. This research aims to develop NR quality measurement algorithms for JPEG compressed images. First, we established a JPEG image database and subjective experiments were conducted on the database. We show that Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), which requires the reference images, is a poor indicator of subjective quality. Therefore, tuning an NR measurement model towards PSNR is not an appropriate approach in designing NR quality metrics. Furthermore, we propose a computational and memory efficient NR quality assessment model for JPEG images. Subjective test results are used to train the model, which achieves good quality prediction performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Therefore, the study of the robust transmission of multimedia data over OFDM systems has attracted extensive research interest. In the past, channel estimation, which is an important aspect in OFDM systems, has not been exploited for multimedia transmission. When using block-training based channel estimation schemes, there exists a periodic variation of the error rates due to channel estimation imprecision. We use this property to provide unequal error protection (UEP) for video transmission. Compared with systems using pilot-training based channel estimation schemes, which are recommended in the DVB-T standard, a performance gain of about 2dB in the PSNR of the reconstructed images is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint channel estimation and unequal error protection scheme for video transmission in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Our approach is based on the observations that (1) most highlights in baseball games are composed of certain types of scene shots and (2) those scene shots exhibit special transition context in time. To exploit those two observations, we first build statistical models for each type of scene shots with products of histograms, and then for each type of highlight a hidden Markov model is learned to represent the context of transition in the time domain. A probabilistic model can be obtained by combining the two, which is used for highlight detection and classification.

We propose a novel algorithm using two cross-shaped search patterns as the first two initial steps and large/small diamond-shaped patterns as the subsequent steps for fast block motion estimation (BME). The first small cross-shaped pattern is to fit the cross-center-biased MVD characteristics of the real-world sequences by evaluating the 5 relatively higher probable candidates located as a cross-shaped pattern at the search-grid center. The proposed small-cross-diamond search algorithm (SCDS) employs a halfway-stop technique and could find small motion vectors with much fewer points than the diamond search algorithm (DS) while maintains similar or even better quality. The speedup improvement of SCDS over DS can be up to 146%, i.e. 2.46 times faster than DS. Simulations show that SCDS is much more robust, provides faster searching speed and smaller distortions than other fast algorithms, typically very suitable for videoconferencing applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel small-cross-diamond search algorithm for fast video coding and videoconferencing applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Experimental tests show that multi-frame reference without overlap can achieve a prediction PSNR improvement of more than 1.5 dB over the conventional single-frame reference non-overlap technique. Considering the three-dimensional overlapped approach with multiple reference frames, a prediction PSNR improvement of up to 2 dB can be obtained.

This method is a block-based method that takes the image structure into account and uses a measure other than the variance to determine if a block is homogeneous. It uses no thresholds and automates the way that block-based methods stop the averaging of block variances. The proposed method selects intensity-homogeneous blocks in an image by rejecting blocks of structure using a new structure analyzer. The analyzer used is based on high-pass operators and special masks for comers to allow implicit detection of structure and to stabilize the homogeneity estimation. For a typical image quality (PSNR of 20-40 dB) the proposed method outperforms other methods significantly and the worst-case estimation error is 3 dB which is suitable for real applications such as video surveillance or broadcasts.

This model is motivated by the observation that geographic regions of interest are characterized by collections of texture motifs corresponding to geographic processes. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of the motifs is an important discriminating characteristic. In our approach, the states of a hidden Markov model (HMM) correspond to the texture motifs and the state transitions correspond to the spatial arrangement of the motifs. A one-dimensional approach reduces the computational complexity. The model is shown to be effective in characterizing objects of interest in spatial datasets in terms of their underlying texture motifs. The potential of the model for identifying the classes of unlabeled objects is demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

An efficient and high throughput codec design is strongly required for handling high-resolution images. We propose an efficient codec architecture for context-based adaptive arithmetic coding, which exhibits low cost, low latency, and high throughput rate. In addition, it can be programmed for supporting multiple standards such as JPEG, JPEG2000, JBIG, and JBIG2 standards. It exploits three-pipeline stages architecture. Based on parallel leading zeros detection and bit-stuffing handling, symbols can be encoded and decoded within one cycle. Therefore, the throughput rate can be increased as high as the codec operating clock rate. For 0.35 /spl mu/ 1P4M CMOS technology, both the encoding and decoding rate can run up to 185 M symbol/sec. The AC codec only costs 12 K gate count and 860 /spl mu/m/spl times/860 /spl mu/m layout area. These performances can meet high-resolution real time application requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038164","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

To classify subjects, multi-layer perceptron neural networks (NNs) are trained for each eigenpaxel. These parallel NN kernels provide sage, fast and efficient classification. To combine the results of parallel NNs, a novel judge analyzer is proposed based on bond rating classification and prediction. The proposed judge strategy can detect distinguishable face features even in arguable situations.

Therefore, the total number of transmissions (forward nodes) is generally used as the cost criterion for broadcasting. The problem of finding the minimum number of forward nodes is NP-complete. Among various approximation approaches, dominant pruning (Lim and Kim 2001) utilizes 2-hop neighborhood information to reduce redundant transmissions. In this paper, we analyze some deficiencies of the dominant pruning algorithm and propose two better approximation algorithms: total dominant pruning and partial dominant pruning. Both algorithms utilize 2-hop neighborhood information more effectively to reduce redundant transmissions. Simulation results of applying these two algorithms show performance improvements compared with the original dominant pruning. In addition, two termination criteria are discussed and compared through simulation under both the static and dynamic environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/22255/01038347.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2002.1038347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2002.1038347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On reducing broadcast redundancy in ad hoc wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Intelligent networks","Wireless networks","Floods","Approximation algorithms","Costs","Algorithm design and analysis","Mobile communication","Personnel","Personal digital assistants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundancy","packet radio networks","mobile radio","broadcasting","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast redundancy","ad hoc wireless networks","packet wireless network","forward nodes","NP-complete problem","approximation approaches","2-hop neighborhood information","redundant transmissions","dominant pruning algorithm","total dominant pruning","partial dominant pruning","termination criteria","static environments","dynamic environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 2002","displayDocTitle":"On reducing broadcast redundancy in ad hoc wireless networks","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1038347/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 2002","accessionNumber":"7418324","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On reducing broadcast redundancy in ad hoc wireless networks","sourcePdf":"01038347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059927S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 2002","isNumber":"22255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"223","articleId":"1038347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1038349,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Zhang","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/22255/1038349/1038349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Zhang (S\u201902) received the BE degree and the ME degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, both in electrical engineering, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

The conventional OFDM system provides advantages through conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free subchannels at multiple frequency bands. However, it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion. Previously, a new OFDM framework, the precoded OFDM, has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free vector channels. In this paper, we consider the application of the precoded OFDM system to efficient scalable video transmission. We propose to enhance the precoded OFDM system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. The more critical layers, or equivalently, the lower layers, are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality. The channel quality is characterized by Frobenius norm metrics; based on channel estimation at the receiver. The channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel. Simulation results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed scheme to noise and fading inherent in wireless channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoded OFDM with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video transmission over frequency-selective fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2002.1038349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/22255/01038349.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2002.1038349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 2002","displayDocTitle":"Precoded OFDM with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video transmission over frequency-selective fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1038349/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"April-June 2002","accessionNumber":"7418326","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoded OFDM with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video transmission over frequency-selective fading channels","sourcePdf":"01038349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103209S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"22255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"22255","articleId":"1038349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1038350,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is to guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) by resource (transmit power and rate) allocation and to achieve high spectral efficiency by base-station assignment. This approach takes the form of a nonlinear-programming large-scale optimization problem: maximizing an abstraction for the profit of a service provider subject to QoS satisfaction. Solutions for both single-cell and multicell systems are investigated. The single-cell solution has the advantage of low complexity and global convergence in comparison with the previous work. Maximum achievable throughput (capacity) of a single cell is mathematically evaluated and used as the benchmark for performance measure of multicell systems. For multicell systems, due to its max-max structure, solving the optimization problem directly entails a high-computational complexity. Instead, the problem is reformulated to a mixed integer nonlinear-programming (MINLP) problem. Then, binary variables indicating base-station assignments are relaxed to their continuous analogs to make a computer solution feasible. Furthermore, approximations can be made to make the resource-management scheme less computationally complex and allow its partial decentralization. The sensitivity of the proposed scheme to path-gain estimation error is studied. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme and the throughput improvement achieved by combining resource allocation with base station assignment.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2002.1038350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/22255/01038350.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2002.1038350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal resource management in wireless multimedia wideband CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr-Jun 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr-Jun 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038350/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal resource management in wireless multimedia wideband CDMA systems","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April-June 2002","accessionNumber":"7418327","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1038350/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal resource management in wireless multimedia wideband CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"01038350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.232602S","chronDate":"Apr-Jun 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"22255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"22255","articleId":"1038350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1038379,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Modularity has been associated with numerous advantages for firms and customers, including faster product development, greater product variety, and allowing customers to customize products. However, there is a lack of clear understanding of the cost implications of modularity. One reason for this gap is the use of the term 'modularity' for similar, yet often slightly different, phenomena in different contexts, disciplines, and industries. Consequently, modularity is very difficult to operationalize. This paper presents a methodology to address this problem. Arguing that modularity is actually a bundle of product characteristics rather than a single dimension, the method proceeds in three steps. First, unbundling modularity into multiple dimensions of the product architecture allows one to comparatively measure the differences among products along the individual dimensions. Second, building on process-based cost modeling tools, a cost estimation procedure calculates the product costs for the selected life cycle or supply chain phases. The third step links the cost differences to individual product architecture differences. These links can improve the understanding of how individual dimensions of the product architecture affect different costs along the supply chain. A case study of automotive doors is used to demonstrate the methodology.","doi":"10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038379","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Engineering Management Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Engineering Management Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/8054/22257/01038379.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"136 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the link between modularity and cost-a methodology to assess cost implications of product architecture differences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","displayDocTitle":"On the link between modularity and cost-a methodology to assess cost implications of product architecture differences","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7529197","htmlLink":"/document/1038379/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the link between modularity and cost-a methodology to assess cost implications of product architecture differences","confLoc":"Cambridge, UK","sourcePdf":"1038379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050573S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8054","isNumber":"22257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8054","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"22257","articleId":"1038379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":1038539,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance.

A digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing. Moreover, no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery, even in the face of high loss rates. We develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using two new classes of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes. We provide performance measurements that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and discuss the design, implementation, and performance of an experimental system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicast protocols","Forward error correction","Feedback","Application software","Computer science","Code standards","Standards development","Measurement","Scalability","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","Internet","transport protocols","performance evaluation","forward error correction","error correction codes","Reed-Solomon codes","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital fountain","asynchronous reliable multicast","autonomous receivers","broadcast protocols","multicast protocol","scalable protocol","heterogeneous receivers","optimal efficiency","high loss rates","erasure codes","large block size","performance measurements","experimental system performance","Internet","FEC codes","forward error correction","RS codes","Tornado codes","Luby transform codes","bulk data distribution","IP multicast","simulation results","interoperability","content distribution methods","Reed-Solomon codes","decoder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038582","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2002.803996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/22260/01038582.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2002.803996","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038582/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","volume":"20","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/1038582/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7414457","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast","sourcePdf":"01038582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073999S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"22260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"389","xplore-issue":"22260","articleId":"1038582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1038583,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Compared with unirate multicasting, this provides more flexibility to the user and allows more efficient usage of the network resources. We address the rate control problem for multirate multicast sessions, with the objective of maximizing the total receiver utility. This aggregate utility maximization problem not only takes into account the heterogeneity in user requirements, but also provides a unified framework for diverse fairness objectives. We propose an algorithm for this problem and show, through analysis and simulation, that it converges to the optimal rates. In spite of the nonseparability of the problem, the solution that we develop is completely decentralized, scalable and does not require the network to know the receiver utilities. The algorithm requires very simple computations both for the user and the network, and also has a very low overhead of network congestion feedback.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2002.803988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22260","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/22260/01038583.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable low-overhead rate control algorithm for multirate multicast sessions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1038583/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A scalable low-overhead rate control algorithm for multirate multicast sessions","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7414458","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable low-overhead rate control algorithm for multirate multicast sessions","sourcePdf":"01038583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110853S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"22260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"22260","articleId":"1038583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1038663,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The structure of the FPNN results from a synergistic usage of FNN and PNN. FNNs contribute to the formation of the premise part of the rule-based structure of the FPNN. The consequence part of the FPNN is designed using PNNs. The structure of the PNN is not fixed in advance as it usually takes place in the case of conventional neural networks, but becomes organized dynamically to meet the required approximation error. We exploit a group method of data handling (GMDH) to produce this dynamic topology of the network. The performance of the FPNN is quantified through experimentation that exploits standard data already used in fuzzy modeling. The obtained experimental results reveal that the proposed networks exhibit high accuracy and generalization capabilities in comparison to other similar fuzzy models.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.803495","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/22264/01038817.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"621","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2002.803495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy polynomial neural networks: hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy polynomial neural networks: hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling","volume":"10","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7424394","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1038817/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy polynomial neural networks: hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling","sourcePdf":"01038817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089718S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"22264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"22264","articleId":"1038817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1038818,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Wu","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/22264/1038818/1038818-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongwei Wu received the B.Eng. degree in automatic control and the M.Eng. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems, from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997 and 1999, respectivley.

We demonstrate, by means of a simulation experiment, that the resulting system can operate without type-reduction and can achieve similar performance to one that uses type-reduction.

In addition, existing rules can be replaced with new rules based on ranking using the informative potential of the data. In this way, the rule-base structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available, rather than being completely retrained. The adaptive nature of these evolving rule-based models, in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules, makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks.

Through the evaluation, analogous relationship between this microvalve and MOSFET has been experimentally demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2002.803414","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/22266/01038835.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2002.803414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pneumatically actuated full in-channel microvalve with MOSFET-like function in fluid channel networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038835/","displayDocTitle":"A pneumatically actuated full in-channel microvalve with MOSFET-like function in fluid channel networks","volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7423916","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1038835/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pneumatically actuated full in-channel microvalve with MOSFET-like function in fluid channel networks","sourcePdf":"01038835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049729S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"22266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"22266","articleId":"1038835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1038840,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Hsuan Lu","affiliation":["Micro Actuators, Sensors and Systems Group, Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Liang-Hsuan Lu received the B.S. degree from the National Taiwan University, Taiwan, and the M.S. degree in microfluidics systems from the University of Illinois, Urbana, in January of 2002.","He is currently residing in Taipei, Taiwan."]},"lastName":"Liang-Hsuan Lu","id":"37336557800"},{"name":"Kee Suk Ryu","affiliation":["Micro Actuators, Sensors and Systems Group, Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kee Suk Ryu received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, and the M.S. degree in bioengineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.

Based on an extension of the well-established theory of thermoelastic damping in homogeneous beams, we present closed-form expressions to estimate an upper bound on the attainable quality factors of polycrystalline beam resonators with thickness (h) much larger than the average grain size (d). Associated with each of these length scales is an independent damping mechanism; we refer to them as Zener and intracrystalline thermoelastic damping, respectively. For representative polysilicon beam resonators (h = 2 /spl mu/m; d = 0.1 /spl mu/m) at 300 K, the predicted critical frequencies for these two mechanisms are /spl sim/7 MHz and /spl sim/14 GHz, respectively. The model is consistent with data from the literature in the sense that the measured values approach, but do not exceed, the calculated thermoelastic limit. From the viewpoint of the maximum attainable Q, our model suggests that single-crystal silicon, rather than fine-grained polysilicon, is the material of choice for the fabrication of flexural beam resonators for applications in the gigahertz frequency range.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2002.802902","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/22266/01038844.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2002.802902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22266","startPage":"499","endPage":"504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermoelastic damping in fine-grained polysilicon flexural beam resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thermoelastic damping in fine-grained polysilicon flexural beam resonators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7423925","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1038844/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermoelastic damping in fine-grained polysilicon flexural beam resonators","sourcePdf":"01038844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070163S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"22266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"22266","articleId":"1038844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":1038850,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. Typically, gel size is sensitive to outer solution pH and salt concentration. In this paper, we develop models to predict the swelling/deswelling of hydrogels in buffered pH solutions. An equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given pH and salt concentration in the solution. A kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution pH is changed. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different pH solutions. The degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel are also studied through experiments. The simulations are compared with experimental results and the models are found to predict the swelling/deswelling processes accurately.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7423931","htmlLink":"/document/1038850/","displayDocTitle":"Equilibrium swelling and kinetics of pH-responsive hydrogels: models, experiments, and simulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equilibrium swelling and kinetics of pH-responsive hydrogels: models, experiments, and simulations","sourcePdf":"01038850.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070714S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"22266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"317","xplore-issue":"22266","articleId":"1038850","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1038851,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-T.

Efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries, are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the pull-in state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pull-in state is approached. Moreover, the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result, the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction (DIPIE) scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the Voltage Iterations (VI) scheme (>100 times faster!). The DIPIE scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers. Therefore, it can be easily implemented in existing MOEMS CAD packages. Moreover, using the DIPIE scheme, the pull-in parameters extraction can be performed in a fully automated mode, and no user input for search bounds is required.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microelectromechanical devices","Voltage","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","Design automation","Electrostatic actuators","Geometry","Electrodes","Packaging","Parameter extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic actuators","micromechanical devices","micro-optics","convergence","electronic design automation","mechanical engineering computing","relaxation theory","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DIPIE algorithm","MOEMS CAD packages","electrostatically actuated MEMS devices","pull-in parameters","electrostatic actuators","design geometries","convergence rate","displacement iteration pull-in extraction scheme","mechanical field solver","electrostatic field solver","computer-aided design","displacement iteration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2002.803280","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/22266/01038858.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2002.803280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient DIPIE algorithm for CAD of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient DIPIE algorithm for CAD of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038858/","volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1038858/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7423939","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient DIPIE algorithm for CAD of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices","sourcePdf":"01038858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053972S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"22266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"22266","articleId":"1038858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1038860,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-Ping Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/22268/1038860/1038860-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsiao-Ping Tsai (S'00) was born in Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1970.

This formulation has two advantages. First, the time-step size is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh, but rather by the Nyquist sampling criterion. Second, the implementation of the truncation by the perfectly matched layers (PML) is straightforward. An anisotropic PML absorbing material is presented for the truncation of FETD lattices. Reflection less than -50 dB is obtained numerically over the entire propagation bandwidth in waveguide and microstrip line. A benchmark test on a microwave amplifier indicates that this extended FETD algorithm is not only superior to finite-difference time-domain-based algorithm in mesh flexibility and simulation accuracy, but also reduces computation time dramatically.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/22268/01038860.pdf","startPage":"2226","endPage":"2232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2002.803442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2002.803442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unconditionally stable extended (USE) finite-element time-domain solution of active nonlinear microwave circuits using perfectly matched layers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Time domain analysis","Microwave circuits","Perfectly matched layers","Electromagnetic analysis","Microwave theory and techniques","Sampling methods","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Lattices","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","microwave circuits","nonlinear network analysis","finite element analysis","time-domain analysis","circuit simulation","equivalent circuits","microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconditionally stable FETD method","finite-element time-domain method","global electromagnetic analysis","global EM analysis","active nonlinear microwave circuits","Nyquist sampling criterion","time-step size","PML truncation","perfectly matched layers","anisotropic PML absorbing material","FETD lattices truncation","waveguide","microstrip line","microwave amplifier","mesh flexibility","simulation accuracy","computation time reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"An unconditionally stable extended (USE) finite-element time-domain solution of active nonlinear microwave circuits using perfectly matched layers","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1038860/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7416089","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unconditionally stable extended (USE) finite-element time-domain solution of active nonlinear microwave circuits using perfectly matched layers","sourcePdf":"01038860.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171451S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"22268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"22268","articleId":"1038860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1038870,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.M.-P.

However, the standard procedure to estimate model parameters is often cumbersome, as it involves several measurement systems (DC, vector network analyzer, etc.). Therefore, we propose a new nonlinear modeling technique, which reduces the complexity of the model generation tremendously and only requires full two-port vectorial large-signal measurements. This paper reports on the results obtained with this new modeling technique applied to both empirical and artificial-neural-network device models. Experimental results are given for high electron-mobility transistors and MOSFETs.

The alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) method is applied, leading to a cylindrical ADI-FDTD scheme where the time step is no longer restricted by the stability condition, but by the modeling accuracy. In contrast to the conventional ADI method, in which the alternation is applied in each coordinate direction, the ADI scheme here performs alternations in mixed coordinates so that only two alternations in solution matching are required at each time step in the three-dimensional formulation. Different from its counterpart in the Cartesian coordinate system, the cylindrical ADI-FDTD includes an additional special treatment along the vertical axis of the cylindrical coordinates to overcome singularity. A theoretical proof of the unconditional stability is shown and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cylindrical algorithm in solving electromagnetic-field problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/22268/01038881.pdf","startPage":"2401","endPage":"2405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2002.803450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2002.803450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1038881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-dimensional unconditionally stable ADI-FDTD method in the cylindrical coordinate system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic fields","Difference equations","Maxwell equations","Frequency domain analysis","Bandwidth","Electromagnetic modeling","Numerical stability","Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic field theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","numerical stability","cavity resonators","dielectric resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unconditionally stable FDTD method","cylindrical coordinate system","alternating-direction-implicit method","cylindrical ADI-FDTD scheme","time step","modeling accuracy","mixed coordinate alternations","three-dimensional formulation","Cartesian coordinate system","numerical results","electromagnetic field problems","resonator structures","cylindrical cavity resonator","cylindrical dielectric resonator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1038881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"A three-dimensional unconditionally stable ADI-FDTD method in the cylindrical coordinate system","volume":"50","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1038881/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7416110","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-dimensional unconditionally stable ADI-FDTD method in the cylindrical coordinate system","sourcePdf":"01038881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071116S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"22268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"22268","articleId":"1038881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1038885,"authors":[{"name":"O.

In this paper we introduce a new approach for estimating the number of regions in an image without a priori information. Using a novel discrete-discrete uncertainty measure defined on equivalence classes of signals, we design a localized separable 2-D wavelet transform. By clustering in a feature space defined by the wavelet coefficients computed over disjoint blocks in the image, we obtain high quality estimates for the number of textured regions present in an image. Compared to a previously reported algorithm based on the eight-point Daubechies wavelet, this new approach tends to produce clusters with improved between-cluster separations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The processing modules used for object detection and tracking will be shown in detail and the performances of the algorithm discussed. The proposed approach uses an empty reference image for object extraction through image difference; the reference frame is updated continuously by a background updating module taking into account the detected objects. The tracking module is responsible for objects labeling being able to preserve objects identity even when an overlapping occurs on the image plane between different objects. A shape matching technique is used that is based on a linear Kalman filter.

The signal is reconstructed on a uniform grid using B-splines basis functions. The computation of spline weights is formulated as a variational problem. Specifically, we minimize a cost that is a weighted sum of two terms: (i) the sum of squared errors at the specified points; (ii) a quadratic functional that penalizes the lack of smoothness. The problem is equivalent to solving a very large system of linear equations, with the dimension equal to the number of grid points. We develop a computationally efficient multiresolution-multigrid scheme for solving the system.

Many times the classical interpolation functions are used, i.e., nearest-neighbour interpolation and bilinear interpolation, which are prone to the introduction of undesirable artifacts due to aliasing such as moire patterns. This paper presents a novel approach which minimizes the loss of information, in a least-squares sense, while resampling between orthogonal and hexagonal lattices. Making use of an extension of 2D splines to hexagonal lattices, the proper reconstruction function is derived. Experimental results for a printing application demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and are compared against the classical techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038987","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

An objective function taking into account the similarity to the known samples and the regularity of the function is minimized in order to obtain a good approximation. We apply the developed algorithm to motion-compensated image interpolation. Under motion compensation, the resulting sampling grids are irregular and require irregular/regular interpolation.

Recent works have proposed several strategies for assigning optimal code-rates to elements in a scalable data stream, under the assumption that all elements are encoded onto a common group of network packets. When the size of the data to be encoded becomes large in comparison with the size of the network packets, such schemes require very long channel codes with high computational complexity. In networks with high loss, small packets are generally more desirable than long packets. This paper proposes a strategy for assigning optimal code-rates to elements of the scalable compressed data source, subject to constraints on the packet size, transmission length and code complexity. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed scheme can outperform previously proposed code-rate assignment policies, subject to the above-mentioned constraints, particularly with high loss.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The BUP algorithm overcomes the periodic shift-invariance of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and is formalized into new prediction rules using filtering operations. BUP is based on the relationships between the subbands of the shifted input signal and the subbands of the non-shifted reference signal, whereby the number of shifts is limited by the periodic shift-invariance of the DWT. We derive the algorithm for the 1-D DWT with three decomposition levels. The combination of all prediction rules of the BUP algorithm defines a new transform: the bottom-up overcomplete DWT or BUP ODWT, which is shift-invariant. The BUP ODWT calculates the overcomplete subbands by applying the prediction rules to the critically sampled subbands of a wavelet-transformed image. The envisaged application for the BUP algorithm is spatially scalable video coding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable wavelet video-coding with in-band prediction - the bottom-up overcomplete discrete wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The current authors recently proposed a motion adaptive wavelet transform based on motion-compensated lifting steps. This approach overcomes several limitations of existing methods. In particular, frame warping and block displacement methods cannot efficiently exploit complex motion without sacrificing invertibility. By contrast, the motion-compensated lifting transform remains invertible regardless of the motion model. The previous work was primarily in the context of a block motion model. However, block motion models inevitably yield discontinuous motion fields, which poorly represent complex motion in real video sequences. In this paper we consider the benefits of a continuous motion field, by incorporating a deformable mesh motion model into the existing framework. Experimental results show that this leads to improved compression performance. In addition, we show that the invertibility of continuous motion fields allows greater potential for compactly representing the motion information.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The trapping-induced flatband shift in HfO/sub 2/ with Al gates increases monotonically with injection fluence for p-type Si substrates, while it shows a turnaround phenomenon for n-type Si substrates due to the shift of the charge centroid. The trapping-induced flatband shift is nearly independent of stress voltage for p-type substrates, while it increases dramatically with stress voltage for n-type Si substrates due to two competing mechanisms. The trap density can be reduced by increasing the annealing temperature from 500/spl deg/C to 600/spl deg/C.

It differs from conventional hard computing (HC) in the sense that, unlike hard computing, it is strongly based on intuition or subjectivity. Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and genetic algorithms (GA) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and GA should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. Considering the number of available journal and conference papers on various combinations of these three methods, it is easy to conclude that the fusion of individual soft computing methodologies has already been advantageous in numerous applications. On the other hand, hard computing solutions are usually more straightforward to analyze; their behavior and stability are more predictable; and, the computational burden of algorithms is typically either low or moderate. These characteristics. are particularly important in real-time applications. Thus, it is natural to see SC and HC as potentially complementary methodologies. Novel combinations of different methods are needed when developing high-performance, cost-effective, and safe products for the demanding global market. We present an overview of applications in which the fusion of soft computing and hard computing has provided innovative solutions for challenging real-world problems.

As such, if one desires to learn a control law in real-time, a fusion of soft computing techniques to learn the appropriate control law with hard computing techniques to maintain the stability constraint and guarantee convergence is required. The objective of the paper is to describe an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm (ADPA) which fuses soft computing techniques to learn the optimal cost (or return) functional for a stabilizable nonlinear system with unknown dynamics and hard computing techniques to verify the stability and convergence of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is initialized with a (stabilizing) cost functional and the system is run with the corresponding control law (defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation), with the resultant state trajectories used to update the cost functional in a soft computing mode. Hard computing techniques are then used to show that this process is globally convergent with stepwise stability to the optimal cost functional/control law pair for an (unknown) input affine system with an input quadratic performance measure (modulo the appropriate technical conditions). Three specific implementations of the ADPA are developed for 1) the linear case, 2) for the nonlinear case using a locally quadratic approximation to the cost functional, and 3) the nonlinear case using a radial basis function approximation of the cost functional; illustrated by applications to flight control.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2002.801727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2002.801727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/22271/01039198.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive dynamic programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive dynamic programming","volume":"32","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2002","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1039198/","publicationDate":"May 2002","accessionNumber":"7428074","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive dynamic programming","sourcePdf":"01039198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098058S","chronDate":"May 2002","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"22271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"450","xplore-issue":"22271","articleId":"1039198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":1039203,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution. We present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039203/","volume":"24","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1039203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7422904","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Elastically adaptive deformable models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastically adaptive deformable models","sourcePdf":"01039203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084218S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"22272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"22272","articleId":"1039203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1039204,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We analytically construct the principal component analysis for images of a convex Lambertian object, explicitly taking attached shadows into account, and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability. Our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical-harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows, under appropriate assumptions, that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors. Our main contribution is in extending these results to the single-viewpoint case, showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset (the upper hemisphere) of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain. Our results are very close, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to previous empirical observations and represent the first essentially complete theoretical explanation of these observations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic PCA construction for theoretical analysis of lighting variability in images of a Lambertian object","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1039204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/22272/01039204.pdf","startPage":"1322","endPage":"1333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1039204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22272","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1039204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039204/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Analytic PCA construction for theoretical analysis of lighting variability in images of a Lambertian object","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1039204/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7422905","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic PCA construction for theoretical analysis of lighting variability in images of a Lambertian object","sourcePdf":"01039204.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099788S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"22272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"22272","articleId":"1039204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1039206,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Given only samples of a finite-dimensional differentiable manifold and no a priori knowledge of the manifold's geometry or topology except for its dimension, the goal is to find a description of the manifold. The learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well, both geometrically and topologically, when the sampling density is sufficiently high. The proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold. An important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold, rather than that of the embedding space. Successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane, curves in space, and surfaces in space; in addition, a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1039206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/22272/01039206.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1357","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1039206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples","volume":"24","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1039206/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7422907","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples","sourcePdf":"01039206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055392S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"22272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"22272","articleId":"1039206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1039233,"authors":[{"name":"K.

They are fast and easy to use. However, due to their inherent parallel structure they consume high power - much higher than SRAMs or DRAMs. A system using four TCAMs could consume upto 60 watts. The power issue is one of the chief disadvantages of TCAMs over RAM based methods for forwarding. For a system using multiple TCAMs we present methods to significantly reduce TCAM power consumption for forwarding, making it comparable to RAM based forwarding solutions. Using our techniques one can use a TCAM for forwarding at 3 to 4 watts worst case. Our techniques also have an interesting connotation to TCAM forwarding rates. For a static distribution of requests we present methods that make the forwarding rate of a system proportional to the number of TCAMs. So if a system has four TCAMs, one could achieve a four fold performance of that of a single TCAM for a static distribution of requests.","doi":"10.1109/CONECT.2002.1039265","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 10th Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 10th Symposium on High Performance Interconnects","pdfPath":"/iel5/8058/22275/01039265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECT.2002.1039265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22275","startPage":"107","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing TCAM power consumption and increasing throughput","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1039265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing TCAM power consumption and increasing throughput","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2002","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7492608","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing TCAM power consumption and increasing throughput","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01039265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045741S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8058","isNumber":"22275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8058","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"22275","articleId":"1039265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1039268,"authors":[{"name":"D.V.

Our presented face recognition cascade has two stages: (a) feature extraction using either principal component analysis (PCA) or the discrete cosine transform (DCT); and (b) pattern classification using the FGNN. We have performed software implementation of the algorithm and experimented the face recognition task for a database of 100 images (10 classes). The recognition score has been 100% (for the test lot) for almost all the considered variants of feature extraction. We have also compared the performances of the FGNN with those obtained using a classical multilayer fuzzy perceptron (FP).

Here, the first step is to align two or several evolutionary related sequences and, in recent years, a number of computer programs have been developed for alignment of large genomic sequences. Some of these programs are extremely fast but often time-efficiency is achieved at the expense of sensitivity. One way of combining speed and sensitivity is to use an anchored-alignment approach. In a first step, a fast heuristic identifies a chain of strong sequence similarities that serve as anchor points. In a second step, regions between these anchor points are aligned using a slower but more sensitive method. We present CHAOS, a novel algorithm for rapid identification of chains of local sequence similarities among large genomic sequences. Similarities identified by CHAOS are used as anchor points to improve the running time of the DIALIGN alignment program. Systematic test runs show that this method can reduce the running time of DIALIGN by more than 93% while affecting the quality of the resulting alignments by only 1%. The source code for CHAOS is available at http://www.stanford.edu//spl sim/brudno/chaos/.","doi":"10.1109/CSB.2002.1039337","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In the signal processing field, Fourier transform is popular for analyzing wave data. However, although this method can process frequency information, it fails to handle locational data. In contrast, the wavelet method accommodates both locational and frequency information for wave analysis. The wavelet method is now increasing in its importance for signal processing. Fast Fourier transform is already applied to biological sequence analysis using correlations. We introduce a new method, called wavelet profile, for biological sequence analysis. Our method is based on multiresolution analysis of wavelet transform, offering data decomposition in several scaling at the same time. We applied our wavelet profile method to identifying gene loci among O. sativa genomic sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The PMHT's problems of nonadaptivity, narcissism, and over-hospitality to clutter are elicited in this work. The PMHT's main selling-point is its flexible and easily modifiable model, which we use to develop the \"homothetic\" PMHT; maneuver-based PMHTs, including those with separate and joint homothetic measurement models; a modified PMHT whose measurement/target association model is more similar to that of the PDAF; and PMHTs with eccentric and/or estimated measurement models. Ideally, \"bottom line\" would be a version of the PMHT with clear advantages over existing trackers. If the goal is of an accurate (in terms of mean square error (MSE)) track, then there are a number of versions for which this is available.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2002.1039396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2002.1039396","startPage":"738","endPage":"754","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/22279/01039396.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PMHT: problems and some solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2002","displayDocTitle":"PMHT: problems and some solutions","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2002","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1039396/","accessionNumber":"7416134","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039396/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PMHT: problems and some solutions","sourcePdf":"01039396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157892S","chronDate":"Jul 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"22279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"22279","articleId":"1039396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1039399,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Four new algorithms that censor outliers are presented which are derived via approximation to the MLE solution. Two algorithms each are related to using the SMI or the FML to estimate the unknown underlying covariance matrix. Results are presented using computer simulations which demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the four algorithms versus each other and also versus the SMI and FML algorithms in the presence of outliers and no outliers. It is shown that one of the censoring algorithms, called the reiterative censored fast maximum likelihood (CFML) technique is significantly superior to the other three censoring methods in stressful outlier scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Matched filters","Covariance matrix","Maximum likelihood estimation","Clutter","Filtering","Degradation","Convergence","Statistics","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","matched filters","filtering theory","covariance matrices","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering","covariance matrix estimate","maximum likelihood estimation setting","steering vector","sample matrix inversion","fast maximum likelihood","censoring algorithms","reiterative censored fast maximum likelihood"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2002.1039406","startPage":"885","endPage":"901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/22279/01039406.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2002.1039406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"7416144","publicationDate":"July 2002","volume":"38","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1039406/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering","sourcePdf":"01039406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117886S","chronDate":"Jul 2002","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"22279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"22279","articleId":"1039406","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1039410,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Kai Chen","affiliation":["National Huwei Institute of Technology, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/22279/1039410/1039410-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Kai Chen (S'98\u2014M'99) was born in Chia-Yi, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1967.

The preprocessings are designed using the latest source parameter estimates obtained from the source trackers, and a redesign is activated periodically or whenever any source has been detected by the source trackers to have made significant movement. Compared with conventional adaptive beamforming, the algorithm has the advantage that no a priori information on any desired signal location is needed, the sources are separated at maximum SNR, and their locations are available.

A prototype of a nanophotonic integrated circuit (IC) is presented, in which the optical near field is used as a carrier to transmit a signal from one nanometric dot to another. Each section of this paper reviews theoretical and experimental studies carried out to assess the possibility of designing, fabricating, and operating each nanophotonic IC device. A key device, the nanophotonic switch, is proposed based on optical near-field energy transfer between quantum dots (QDs). The optical near-field interaction is expressed as the sum of the Yukawa function, and the oscillation period of the nutation of cubic CuCl QDs is estimated to be less than 100 ps. To guarantee one-directional (i.e., irreversible) energy transfer between two resonant levels of QDs, intrasublevel transitions due to phonon coupling are examined by considering a simple two-QD plus phonon heat bath system. As a result, the state-filling time is estimated as 22 ps for CuCl QDs. This time is almost independent of the temperature in the Born-Markov approximation. Using cubic CuCl QDs in a NaCl matrix as a test sample, the optical near-field energy transfer was experimentally verified by near-field optical spectroscopy with a spatial resolution smaller than 50 nm in the near-UV region at 15 K. This transfer occurs from the lowest state of excitons in 4.6-nm QDs to the first dipole-forbidden excited state of excitons in 6.3-nm QDs. To fabricate nanophotonic devices and ICs, chemical vapor deposition using an optical near field is proposed; this is sufficiently precise in controlling the size and position of the deposited material. A novel deposition scheme under nonresonant conditions is also demonstrated and its origin is discussed. In order to confirm the possibility of using a nanometric ZnO dot as a light emitter in a nanophotonic IC, spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging of individual ZnO nanocrystallites was carried out with a spatial resolution as high as 55 nm, using a UV fiber probe, and the spectral shift due to the quantum size effect was found. To connect the nanophotonic IC to external photonic devices, a nanometer-scale waveguide was developed using a metal-coated silicon wedge structure. Illumination (wavelength: 830 nm) of the metal-coated silicon wedge (width: 150 nm) excites a TM plasmon mode with a beam width of 150 nm and propagation length of 2.5 /spl mu/m. A key device for nanophotonics, an optical near-field probe with an extremely high throughput, was developed by introducing a pyramidal silicon structure with localized surface plasmon resonance at the metallized probe tip. A throughput as high as 2.3% was achieved. Finally, as an application of nanophotonics to, a high-density, high-speed optical memory system, a novel contact slider with a pyramidal silicon probe array was developed. This slider was used for phase-change recording and reading, and a mark length as short as 110 nm was demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2002.801738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2002.801738","endPage":"862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/22281/01039477.pdf","startPage":"839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanophotonics: design, fabrication, and operation of nanometric devices using optical near fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039477/","displayDocTitle":"Nanophotonics: design, fabrication, and operation of nanometric devices using optical near fields","volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"7427462","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039477/","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanophotonics: design, fabrication, and operation of nanometric devices using optical near fields","sourcePdf":"01039477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173033S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 2002","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"22281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"22281","articleId":"1039477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1039478,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

Without proper security mechanisms, networks will be confined to limited, controlled environments, negating much of the promise they hold. The limited ability of individual sensor nodes to thwart failure or attack makes ensuring network availability more difficult. To identify denial-of-service vulnerabilities, the authors analyzed two effective sensor network protocols that did not initially consider security.

Moreover, the criteria for the optimization of the weighting function of the filter for a given detection system are determined and discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039701/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"June 2002","accessionNumber":"7435369","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multicorrelated double sampling readout of asynchronous events from multi-element semiconductor detectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicorrelated double sampling readout of asynchronous events from multi-element semiconductor detectors","sourcePdf":"01039701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055312S","chronDate":"June  2002","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"22287","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"22287","articleId":"1039701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1039702,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These kind of networks are very flexible, thus they do not require any existing infrastructure or central administration. Therefore, mobile ad-hoc networks are suitable for temporary communication links. The biggest challenge in this kind of networks is to find a path between the communication end points, what is aggravated through the node mobility. In this paper we present a new on-demand routing algorithm for mobile, multi-hop ad-hoc networks. The protocol is based on swarm intelligence and especially on the ant colony based meta heuristic. These approaches try to map the solution capability of swarms to mathematical and engineering problems. The introduced routing protocol is highly adaptive, efficient and scalable. The main goal in the design of the protocol was to reduce the overhead for routing. We refer to the protocol as the ant-colony-based routing algorithm (ARA).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039715/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"2002","accessionNumber":"7456242","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ARA-the ant-colony based routing algorithm for MANETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARA-the ant-colony based routing algorithm for MANETs","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01039715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069569S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8062","isNumber":"22290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8062","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"22290","articleId":"1039715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1039772,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

Declustering is used to distribute blocks of data among multiple devices, thus enabling parallel I/O access and reducing query response times. A strictly optimal declustering, or disk allocation, technique is the one that achieves optimal performance for all possible queries. We propose to use replication to reach optimal parallel I/O in multidisk/processor architectures. Replication is a well-known and effective solution for several problems in a database context, especially for availability and load balancing problems. Intelligent replication is considered. We especially focus on allocations based on latin squares and derive several nice properties for replication and declustering purposes. Three different replication strategies are proposed and evaluated. Using the proposed schemes, strict optimality is reached, even with a single replication, for all possible range queries and for several number of disks. We first show this for m-by-m grid on m disks, and then generalize it to any arbitrary a-by-b grids. We also show how to efficiently find optimal disk accesses for a given arbitrary query by storing minimal information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039772/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","publicationDate":"2002","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039772/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","accessionNumber":"7456297","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal parallel I/O using replication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal parallel I/O using replication","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01039772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057742S","chronDate":"2002","xplore-pub-id":"8062","isNumber":"22290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8062","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"22290","articleId":"1039772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":1039773,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The theory developed is applicable in many different and complicated situations so the importance of the paper is clear.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential stability of stochastic delay interval systems with Markovian switching","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2002.803529","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/22292/01039796.pdf","startPage":"1604","endPage":"1612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2002.803529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1039796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039796/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Exponential stability of stochastic delay interval systems with Markovian switching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1039796/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7428746","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential stability of stochastic delay interval systems with Markovian switching","sourcePdf":"01039796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058051S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"22292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"22292","articleId":"1039796","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":1039800,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

One of the main contributions of the paper is the introduction of a device, which win be called the inerter, which is the true network dual of the spring. This contrasts with the mass element which, by definition, always has one terminal connected to ground. The inerter allows electrical circuits to be translated over to mechanical ones in a completely analogous way. The inerter need not have large mass. This allows any arbitrary positive-real impedance to be synthesized mechanically using physical components which may be assumed to have small mass compared to other structures to which they may be attached. The possible application of the inerter is considered to a vibration absorption problem, a suspension strut design, and as a simulated.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2002.803532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2002.803532","startPage":"1648","endPage":"1662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/22292/01039800.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of mechanical networks: the inerter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of mechanical networks: the inerter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1039800/","accessionNumber":"7428750","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039800/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of mechanical networks: the inerter","sourcePdf":"01039800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122126S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"22292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"543","xplore-issue":"22292","articleId":"1039800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":1039805,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The Semantic Web offers a solution, capturing and exploiting the meaning of terms to transform the Web from a platform that focuses on presenting information, to a platform that focuses on understanding and reasoning with information. To support Semantic Web development, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched the DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) initiative to fund research in languages, tools, infrastructure, and applications that make Web content more accessible and understandable. Although the US government funds DAML, several organizations-including US and European businesses and universities, and international consortia such as the World Wide Web Consortium-have contributed to work on issues related to DAML's development and deployment. We focus on DAML's current markup language, DAML+OIL, which is a proposed starting point for the W3C's Semantic Web Activity's Ontology Web Language (OWL). We introduce DAML+OIL syntax and usage through a set of examples, drawn from a wine knowledge base used to teach novices how to build ontologies.","doi":"10.1109/MIS.2002.1039835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/9670/22293/01039835.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2002.1039835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DAML+OIL: an ontology language for the Semantic Web","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","displayDocTitle":"DAML+OIL: an ontology language for the Semantic Web","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1039835/","accessionNumber":"7422379","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAML+OIL: an ontology language for the Semantic Web","sourcePdf":"01039835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052057S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"9670","isNumber":"22293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9670","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"22293","articleId":"1039835","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1039838,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Previous studies are focused on efficient processing of read-only transactions at the mobile clients, neglecting update transactions. In this paper, we design a new protocol for processing both read-only and update mobile transactions. The protocol can detect data conflicts at an early stage at the mobile clients and resolve data conflicts flexibly using dynamic adjustment of timestamp ordering. Early data conflict detection saves processing and communication resources, while dynamic adjustment of timestamp ordering allows more schedules of transaction executions such that unnecessary transaction aborts can be avoided. We performed extensive simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these two features for the performance of the new protocol. The analysis of simulation results showed that both features are effective and contribute differently to the satisfactory performance of the protocol.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Protocols","Application software","Concurrency control","Wireless communication","Mobile computing","Portable computers","Electronic commerce"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","probability","protocols","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transaction processing","partial validation","timestamp ordering","mobile broadcast environments","concurrency control protocols","read-only transactions","mobile clients","communication resources"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TC.2002.1039845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/22294/01039845.pdf","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2002.1039845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On transaction processing with partial validation and timestamp ordering in mobile broadcast environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1039845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On transaction processing with partial validation and timestamp ordering in mobile broadcast environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039845/","volume":"51","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1039845/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"7428920","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On transaction processing with partial validation and timestamp ordering in mobile broadcast environments","sourcePdf":"01039845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073649S","chronDate":"Oct 2002","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"22294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"22294","articleId":"1039845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":1039856,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.C.

In a typical DDoS attack, a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim, or its Internet connection, or both. In the last two years, it was discovered that DDoS attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated, effective, and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers. On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold. The first one is to describe various DDoS attack methods, and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms. The second is to discuss a longer-term solution, dubbed the Internet-firewall approach, that attempts to intercept attack packets in the Internet core, well before reaching the victim.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039856/","volume":"40","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/1039856/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7422914","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","displayDocTitle":"Defending against flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attacks: a tutorial","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defending against flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attacks: a tutorial","sourcePdf":"01039856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045949S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"22296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"22296","articleId":"1039856","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1039859,"authors":[{"name":"Hongmei Deng","affiliation":["University of Cincinnati, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hongmei Deng (hdeng@ececs.uc.edu) is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cincinnati.

However, wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the \"black hole\" problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs.

In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines. DSM-capable DSL thus enables the broadband age.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2002.1039864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/22296/01039864.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2002.1039864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22296","startPage":"101","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1039864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7422921","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039864/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems","sourcePdf":"01039864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088929S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"22296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"22296","articleId":"1039864","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1039865,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional \"flat rate user bandwidth consumption\" approaches to provisioning and engineering.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2002.1039865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22296","startPage":"110","endPage":"117","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/22296/01039865.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Internet traffic streams: dragonflies and tortoises","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1039865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2002","htmlLink":"/document/1039865/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Understanding Internet traffic streams: dragonflies and tortoises","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2002","accessionNumber":"7422922","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Internet traffic streams: dragonflies and tortoises","sourcePdf":"01039865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0547S","chronDate":"Oct.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"22296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"22296","articleId":"1039865","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1039879,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A key problem associated with this scenario is that of predictive mismatch or drift. In the present paper, we pose the problem of predictive encoding with multiple possible predictors as a variant of the well-known Wyner-Ziv side-information problem. We propose an approach based on the use of coset codes for predictive encoding, for mitigating the effect of drift without overly sacrificing compression efficiency. The proposed approach can be used to improve coding performance in a wide range of practical applications such as multiple description coding, scalable coding and redundant storage of video/audio streams. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through a simple example based on the application of low-delay Internet telephony. Our results indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional predictive encoding for communication over lossy channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive encoding using coset codes","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

While conventional subspace methods compute L/sub 1/ or L/sub 2/ metrics to represent distances between samples and apply principal component analysis or similar to induce linear manifolds, the isomap method estimates the geodesic distance between samples and then uses multidimensional scaling to induce a low dimensional manifold. Since the isomap method is based on the reconstruction principle, it may not be optimal from the classification viewpoint. We present an extended isomap method that utilizes the Fisher linear discriminant for pattern classification. Numerous experiments on image data sets show that our extension is more effective than the original isomap method for pattern classification. Furthermore, the extended isomap method shows promising results compared with the best classification methods in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039901","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

A generalization of the well-known LSB (least significant bit) modification is proposed as the data embedding method, which introduces additional operating points on the capacity-distortion curve. Lossless recovery of the original is achieved by compressing portions of the signal that are susceptible to embedding distortion, and transmitting these compressed descriptions as a part of the embedded payload. A prediction-based conditional entropy coder which utilizes static portions of the host as side-information improves the compression efficiency, and thus the lossless data embedding capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039911","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The design of a fast algorithm with low memory requirements for the computation of an unequal loss protection solution is essential in real-time systems.

In this paper, we present a fast iterative improvement algorithm with negligible memory requirements. Experimental results for the JPEG2000, 2D, and 3D set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) coders showed that our algorithm provided close to optimal peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance, while its time complexity was significantly lower than that of all previously proposed algorithms.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

A widely accepted standard-compliant technique to enhance the quality of the decoded video significantly is the more frequent introduction of intra-coded macroblocks. However, intra-coded information generally requires more bit rate. Therefore, a careful selection of intra-updates in terms of rate and distortion is necessary. A flexible and robust rate-distortion optimization technique is presented to select coding mode and reference frame for each macroblock. The channel statistics are included in the optimization process. We derive a method to obtain an estimate of the decoder pixel distortion at the encoder.

For each pair of temporally adjacent frames, both forward and backward motion estimation is conducted with a correlation constraint imposed upon block-based motion vectors. The fact that spatially adjacent pixels in a picture exhibit high correlation is exploited for adaptive refinement. It takes advantage of the complementary frames that are compensated using forward and backward motion estimates. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Using this unified framework, the performance of the various standards is compared by means of PSNR and subjective testing results. The results indicate that JVT/H.26L/AVC compliant encoding can typically achieve essentially the same objective PSNR reproduction quality as encoders that are compliant with previous standards while requiring as little as 60% or less of the bit rate of the next best standard, particularly for higher-latency applications and particularly for more difficult source material. Subjective testing shows that the bit savings produced by this draft standard are even larger than the PSNR results indicate.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039997","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In the recent JVT video coding scheme (MPEG-4 part 10, H.264) displacement vector resolutions of 1/4- or 1/8-pel are applied. In order to estimate and compensate these fractional-pel displacements, interpolation filters are used. So far, these interpolation filters are invariant. The same filter coefficients are applied for all sequences and for all images of a sequence. Therefore it is not possible to consider non-stationary statistical properties of video signals in the interpolation process. In this paper an adaptive interpolation scheme is presented. This interpolation scheme uses filter coefficients that are adapted once per image to the non-stationary statistical properties of the video signal. The filter-coefficients are coded and transmitted. Due to the adaptive interpolation filter a coding gain up to 0.8 dB PSNR is obtained in the JVT coding scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039999","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.
