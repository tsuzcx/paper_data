For example, traffic monitoring, layer-7 filtering, and network intrusion detection all require an accurate analysis of packet content in search for predefined patterns to identify specific classes of applications, viruses, attack signatures, etc. Regular expressions are often used to represent such patterns. They are implemented using finite automata, which take the payload of a packet as an input string. However, existing approaches, both non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and deterministic finite automata (DFA), have limitations; NFAs have excessive time complexity while DFAs have excessive space complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for regular expression matching to implement deep packet inspection on multi-core architecture. A regular expression is split into NFA-friendly components and DFA-friendly components, which are then assigned to different cores. This hybrid method combines the merits of NFA and DFA implementations, and efficiently takes advantage of multi-core architecture. We evaluate our algorithm using rule sets provided by Snort, a popular open-source intrusion detection system. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing NFA/DFA and hybrid approaches. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well on the important issues on multi-core architecture design, such as load balancing, data locality and communication between cores.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Regular Expression Matching for Deep Packet Inspection on Multi-Core Architecture","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559661/5560011/05560073.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560011","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Regular Expression Matching for Deep Packet Inspection on Multi-Core Architecture","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560073/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11514057","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Regular Expression Matching for Deep Packet Inspection on Multi-Core Architecture","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"03-07-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058485S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559661","isNumber":"5560011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559661","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5560011","articleId":"5560073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5560147,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Do","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, MS 1G5, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Tuan","lastName":"Do","id":"37305193700"},{"name":"Brian L.

In cognitive radio networks, secondary users equipped with frequency-agile cognitive radios communicate with one another via spectrum that is not being used by the primary, licensed users of the spectrum. We consider a multichannel cognitive radio network scenario in which a secondary transmitter can switch to different channels for opportunistic communications. Multichannel diversity can be achieved by dynamically switching to different channels during transmission. Our numerical results show that even a simple randomized channel switching scheme can significantly reduce the average symbol error probability. We also propose a scheduling algorithm based on maximizing signal-to-noise ratio to further improve the performance of cognitive transmission.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560147","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559661/5560011/05560147.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2010.5560147","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of 19th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Multichannel Diversity in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Multichannel Diversity in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560147/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560147/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11514022","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Multichannel Diversity in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"01-04-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07634S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559661","isNumber":"5560011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559661","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560011","articleId":"5560147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5560148,"authors":[{"name":"Moussa Diallo","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Division, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Moussa","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37540908000"},{"name":"Rodrigue Rabineau","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Division, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Rodrigue","lastName":"Rabineau","id":"37545546000"},{"name":"Laurent Cariou","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Division, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Cariou","id":"37299003800"},{"name":"Maryline Helard","affiliation":["France Telecom R&D Division, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"Helard","id":"37269770700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7116-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7114-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7115-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"},{"format":"CD","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"5560148","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Channel estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Complexity theory","OFDM","Frequency domain analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","computational complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truncated SVD method","MIMO-OFDM systems","complexity reduction","transform domain channel estimation","truncated singular value decomposition","transfer matrix","3GPP system context"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems, specifically when null carriers are placed at the border of the spectrum in order to limit interference with neighboring spectrums.

Truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) based method allows to improve the accuracy of the TD-CE by significantly reducing each \"border effect\".

In this paper, we propose a procedure for data sharing when multiple sensing nodes and multiple transmitters are used and examine the energy consumption for beamforming.

Since it is unlikely that any single anomaly detection technique will ever be sufficient, we propose the use of multiple existing anomaly detection algorithms in parallel. In this paper, we develop a method of combining different classes of anomaly detection algorithms and address the question of which combination of existing anomaly detection algorithms achieves the best detection accuracy.

It is also shown that artificial noise can help to enlarge the secrecy rate region, in particular on the single user point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Secret Communication with Artificial Noise in Symmetric Interference Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.081910.101121","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5593934/05560174.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.081910.101121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5593934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Secret Communication with Artificial Noise in Symmetric Interference Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5560174/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11560976","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Secret Communication with Artificial Noise in Symmetric Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"885-cl1010-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043645S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5593934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5593934","articleId":"5560174","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560175,"authors":[{"name":"John MacLaren Walsh","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"John MacLaren","lastName":"Walsh","id":"37284964800"},{"name":"Phillip Allan Regalia","affiliation":["Catholic University of America, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Phillip Allan","lastName":"Regalia","id":"37284949500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5560175","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Belief propagation","Maximum likelihood detection","Optimization","Maximum likelihood decoding","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","graph theory","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood detection","optimisation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief propagation decoding","joint maximum likelihood detection","Bethe free energy pseudo-dual","constrained optimization","zero constraint","factor graph","turbo decoding","iterative decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation","factor graphs","probabilistic decoding","turbo decoding","iterative decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560175","abstract":"Belief propagation, via a novel reinterpretation of the Bethe free energy's pseudo-dual, is shown to be related to a novel relaxation of maximum likelihood detection via a constrained optimization.

An incentive-based auction mechanism is presented to induce cooperative behavior in wireless networks with emphasis on users with asymmetrical channel fading conditions. A single-object second-price auction is studied for cooperative partner selection in single-carrier networks. In addition, a multiple-object bundled auction is analyzed for the selection of multiple simultaneous partners in a cooperative orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) setting. For both cases, we characterize equilibrium outage probability performance, seller revenue, and feedback bounds. The auction-based partner selection allows winning bidders to achieve their desired QoS while compensating the seller who assists them. At the local level sellers aim for revenue maximization, while connections are drawn to min-max fairness at the network level. The proposed strategies for partner selection in self-configuring cooperative wireless networks are shown to be robust under conditions of uncertainty in the number of users requesting cooperation, as well as minimal topology and channel link information available to individual users.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.082010.080248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05560176.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.082010.080248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","startPage":"2903","endPage":"2915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Auction-Theoretic Strategies for Distributed Partner Selection in Cooperative Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"General Auction-Theoretic Strategies for Distributed Partner Selection in Cooperative Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588300","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560176/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Auction-Theoretic Strategies for Distributed Partner Selection in Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"2903-tc1010-mukherjee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13068S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5560176","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560177,"authors":[{"name":"Itsik Bergel","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5601500/5560177/5560177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Itsik Bergel was born in Beer-Sheva, Israel, in 1971.

The analysis shows that in some scenarios (and in particular in mixed-length binders) the use of partial FEXT cancellation is crucial to achieve precoder convergence in a reasonable time. Based on this analysis we determine that convergence is achievable in most practical channels. These bounds also allow for the proper setting of the convergence parameters.

Bidirectional relaying applies to three-node networks, where a relay establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol. First, the two nodes transmit their messages to the relay which decodes them. Then, the relay broadcasts a reencoded message in such a way that both nodes can decode their intended message using their own message as side information. We consider uncertainty in the channel state information (CSI) and assume that all nodes only know that the channel over which the transmission takes place is from a pre-specified set of channels. In this work, we concentrate on the second phase, which is called the compound bidirectional broadcast channel. We present a robust coding strategy which enables reliable communication under channel uncertainty and show that this strategy actually achieves the compound capacity. Further, we analyze scenarios where either the receivers or the transmitter have perfect CSI. We show that CSI at the receivers does not affect the maximal achievable rates, while CSI at the transmitter improves the capacity region. A numerical example and a game-theoretic interpretation complete this work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Coding Strategies for Bidirectional Broadcast Channels Under Channel Uncertainty","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.082010.090170","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05560178.pdf","startPage":"2984","endPage":"2994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.082010.090170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Coding Strategies for Bidirectional Broadcast Channels Under Channel Uncertainty","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5560178/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588291","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Coding Strategies for Bidirectional Broadcast Channels Under Channel Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"2984-tc1010-wyrembelski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078473S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5560178","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560179,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Sergi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Sergi","id":"37545577100"},{"name":"Fabrizio Pancaldi","affiliation":["Department of Science and Methods for Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Pancaldi","id":"37279016900"},{"name":"Giorgio Matteo Vitetta","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio Matteo","lastName":"Vitetta","id":"37279022400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5560179","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretical Approach to the Management of Transmission Selection Scheme in Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","abstract":"In this paper, game theory is exploited to derive a novel solution to manage virtual antenna array based transmissions in an ad hoc wireless network consisting of selfish nodes.

It is assumed that a bidirectional relay network consists of two sources and a relay, where each node has a single antenna and operates in a half-duplex mode, and the PNC over finite GF(2) is employed. In this system, since the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection metric of the multiple access channel (MAC) at the relay is given by the sum of two exponential functions, it is not possible to utilize the classical Euclidean distance rule. To make the performance analysis tractable, we approximate the ML detection metric by adopting the max-log approximation. Then we derive tight upper and lower bounds in closed form for the average symbol error probability of the MAC at the relay. Finally, we obtain tight upper and lower bounds in closed form for the end-to-end average bit-error rate (BER).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05560181.pdf","startPage":"2770","endPage":"2775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.082010.090256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.082010.090256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Performance Analysis of BPSK Modulation in Physical-Layer Network-Coded Bidirectional Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Binary phase shift keying","Error probability","Approximation methods","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","multi-access systems","network coding","phase shift keying","protocols","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error performance analysis","BPSK modulation","physical layer network-coded bidirectional relay networks","PNC protocol","binary phase shift keying","Rayleigh fading channels","single antenna","maximum likelihood detection metric","multiple access channel","MAC","exponential functions","classical Euclidean distance rule","ML detection metric","max-log approximation","symbol error probability","end-to-end average bit-error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional relay network","end-to-end bit-error rate (BER)","multiple access channel (MAC)","physical-layer network coding (PNC)","upper and lower bounds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Error Performance Analysis of BPSK Modulation in Physical-Layer Network-Coded Bidirectional Relay Networks","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5560181/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588296","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Performance Analysis of BPSK Modulation in Physical-Layer Network-Coded Bidirectional Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"2770-tc1010-ju.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060191S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5560181","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5560184,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Han Bae","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun Han","lastName":"Bae","id":"37071916100"},{"name":"Attahiru S.

FSM protection architectures based on linear codes cannot provide a guaranteed level of protection under the assumption of a strong attack model. In this paper, we propose secure FSM architectures based on the idea of randomly selecting one code from a set of codes for each encoding and decoding operation. Assuming that the attacker is able to inject specific error patterns, randomly selecting one code from L codes as described in the paper can reduce the chance for the attacker to conduct a successful attack by a factor of L. The proposed techniques can achieve much higher security level than architectures based on linear codes with reasonable hardware overhead for cryptography applications (120% - 130% for the protection of the FSM for the Montgomery ladder algorithm). The security level of the proposed architectures can be increased by increasing L and the number of information bits k of the codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560195/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11515164","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust FSMs for cryptographic devices resilient to strong fault injection attacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust FSMs for cryptographic devices resilient to strong fault injection attacks","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp049104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090005S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550907","isNumber":"5560185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550907","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5560185","articleId":"5560195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560201,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Minas","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Minas","id":"37298732800"},{"name":"Ingrid De Wolf","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"De Wolf","id":"37282765200"},{"name":"Erik Jan Marinissen","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erik Jan","lastName":"Marinissen","id":"37273353200"},{"name":"Mich\u00e8le Stucchi","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mich\u00e8le","lastName":"Stucchi","id":"37325237100"},{"name":"Herman Oprins","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Herman","lastName":"Oprins","id":"37400793700"},{"name":"Abdelkarim Mercha","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Abdelkarim","lastName":"Mercha","id":"37268833600"},{"name":"Geert Van der Plaas","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Van der Plaas","id":"37545639600"},{"name":"Dimitrios Velenis","affiliation":["IMEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Velenis","id":"37281977100"},{"name":"Pol Marchal","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"firstName":"Pol","lastName":"Marchal","id":"37265044400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7723-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7724-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7722-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5560201","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":515},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560201","abstract":"3D-Stacked ICs (3D-SIC) based on Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) offer alleviation of the performance and interconnect density bottlenecks faced by traditional CMOS scaling. As a result there is a lot of industrial focus to make this technology available for the next generation of SoCs. However, for 3D integration to become a viable product approach, it requires that the additional processing steps necessary preserve the integrity of both front-end and back-end of devices and constituting materials. 3D processing steps such as TSV insertion and wafer thinning, have an impact on the functionality and performance of analog and digital circuits, which needs to be accounted for during the design phase. Moreover, testing 3D-SICs calls for more complex test flow trade-offs and enhanced design-for-test architectures for test access within the stack. Finally, the reliability consequences with respect to thermal and mechanical stress in dense stacks of thinned wafers need to be carefully assessed to guarantee a target product life time. In this presentation we discuss the above mentioned challenges and some of the emerging solutions.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2010.5560201","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International On-Line Testing Symposium","startPage":"217","endPage":"217","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550907/5560185/05560201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2010.5560201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D integration: Circuit design, test, and reliability challenges","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D integration","Circuit design","circuit testing","circuit reliability","3D-Stacked IC","Through-Silicon Vias","CMOS scaling","TSV insertion","wafer thinning","thermal stress","mechanical stress"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"3D integration: Circuit design, test, and reliability challenges","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11515169","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560201/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560201/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D integration: Circuit design, test, and reliability challenges","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp043S31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07221S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550907","isNumber":"5560185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550907","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560185","articleId":"5560201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560207,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Presented application dependent test does not require reconfiguration of the tested hardware, thus it preserves conditions that led to the erroneous behavior of the FPGA device. The test method saves time and memory requirements of the test by storing compressed test patterns into the internal structure of the FPGA. The patterns are obtained with the help of the improved COMPAS algorithm - compression system based on test pattern overlapping. The COMPAS requires unused scan chains for the test pattern decompression. This is well suited for nowadays FPGAs which contain high number of LUT based shift registers. The neighborhood of the tested circuit is dynamically reconfigured into TPG and ORA. The TPG contains compressed test patterns which allow fast test pattern decompression. The paper demonstrates efficiency of this approach on experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2010.5560208","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 16th International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550907/5560185/05560208.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2010.5560208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560185","startPage":"192","endPage":"193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application dependent FPGA testing method using compressed deterministic test vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application dependent FPGA testing method using compressed deterministic test vectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560208/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515176","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560208/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application dependent FPGA testing method using compressed deterministic test vectors","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"rp034093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068813S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550907","isNumber":"5560185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550907","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560185","articleId":"5560208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560219,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed NAND channel number detector automatically detects the number of channels, that is, the number of NAND chips written at the same time. Based on the number of channels, the intelligent program-voltage booster adaptively optimizes the switching clock. As a result, the proposed 3D-SSD realizes both the fastest write and the lowest energy consumption. In the random write with a small data size, the booster operates in an energy saving mode and decreases the energy consumption of the booster by 32%. In the sequential write with a large data size, up to 24 channels are activated. The booster operates in a high-speed mode to accelerate the pumping.

We propose uniform and non-uniform sub-carrier allocation schemes, which guarantee full diversity if all involved channels have identical lengths. The non-uniform allocation scheme also guarantees full diversity if the involved channels have different lengths.

It is assumed that dual-hop relay link consists of a source, a relay, and a destination without a direct path signal from the source to the destination and the relay cooperates with the source through the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol with instantaneous power scaling (IPS) mechanism. Both the links are statistically independent and undergo non-identical flat Nakagami-m fading. Now, assuming perfect frequency and phase synchronization, we derive a closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expression for noncoherent MFSK following the cumulative distribution function (CDF) based approach. Also, we observe improvement in error performance while comparing our results with a dual-hop relay transmission under average power scaling (APS) constraint. Computer simulations are performed to validate our proposed mathematical analysis. The obtained error probability expression will prove to be useful for achieving the cooperative diversity with multiple dual-hop relays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error analysis of noncoherent FSK with variable gain relaying in dual-hop Nakagami-m relay fading channel","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560477","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560477.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Error analysis of noncoherent FSK with variable gain relaying in dual-hop Nakagami-m relay fading channel","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560477/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515556","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error analysis of noncoherent FSK with variable gain relaying in dual-hop Nakagami-m relay fading channel","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569287705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079523S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560478,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Pande","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Pande","id":"37411943800"},{"name":"Joseph Zambreno","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Zambreno","id":"37393987200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7138-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7136-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5560478","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":511},"abstract":"Chaotic encryption schemes are believed to provide a greater level of security than conventional ciphers. In this paper, a chaotic stream cipher is first constructed and then its hardware implementation details using FPGA technology are provided. Logistic map is the simplest chaotic system and has a high potential to be used to design a stream cipher for real-time embedded systems. The cipher uses a pseudo-random sequence generator based on modified logistic map (MLM) and a random feedback scheme. MLM has better chaotic properties than the logistic map in terms of uniformity of bifurcation diagram and also avoids the stable orbits of logistic map, giving a more chaotic behavior to the system. The proposed cipher gives 16 bits of encrypted data per clock cycle. The hardware implementation results over Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA give a synthesis clock frequency of 93 MHz and a throughput of 1.5 Gbps while using 16 hardware multipliers. This makes the cipher suitable for embedded devices which have tight constraints on power consumption, hardware resources and real-time parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560478.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and hardware implementation of a chaotic encryption scheme for real-time embedded systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaotic communication","Logistics","Hardware","Encryption","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bifurcation","chaotic communication","cryptography","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","chaotic encryption scheme","real-time embedded systems","conventional ciphers","chaotic stream cipher","FPGA technology","chaotic system","pseudo-random sequence generator","modified logistic map","random feedback scheme","chaotic properties","bifurcation diagram","chaotic behavior","encrypted data","Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA","synthesis clock frequency","power consumption","hardware resources","real-time parameters","word length 16 bit","frequency 93 MHz","bit rate 1.5 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chaos","encryption","stream cipher","FPGA implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and hardware implementation of a chaotic encryption scheme for real-time embedded systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560478/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515557","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and hardware implementation of a chaotic encryption scheme for real-time embedded systems","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569287751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047668S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560482,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna A Vijaya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, P E S Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Krishna A","lastName":"Vijaya","id":"37085616992"},{"name":"K.V.S.

In the former case, we obtain the jointly optimal precoder-equalizer pair of the specified order. In the latter case, we use a zero padding precoder, and obtain the MMSE equalizer.

Such a problem is important, for example, in multilevel analog-to-digital (A/D) converters. The first operation in such sampling modalities is a comparator, which gives rise to a bilevel waveform. Since bilevel signals are not bandlimited, measuring the level-crossing times exactly becomes impractical within the conventional framework of Shannon sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel sub-Nyquist sampling technique for making measurements on a uniform grid and thereby for exactly computing the level-crossing times from those samples. The computational complexity of the technique is low and comprises simple arithmetic operations.

The Bayesian framework is adopted, with the performance measure being the probability of detection error. A decentralized setup, where N sensors use M observations each to arrive at individual decisions that are combined at a fusion center to form the overall decision is considered. The unknown fading channel between the primary sensor and the cognitive radios makes the individual decision rule computationally complex, hence, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based approach is adopted. Analysis of the probabilities of false alarm and miss detection of the proposed method reveals that the error exponent with respect to M is zero. Also, the fusion of N individual decisions offers a diversity advantage, similar to diversity reception in communication systems, and a tight bound on the error exponent is presented. Through an analysis in the low power regime, the number of observations needed as a function of received power, to achieve a given probability of error is determined. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11515568","htmlLink":"/document/5560489/","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian decentralized spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian decentralized spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569287106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.173462S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5560491,"authors":[{"name":"M.

On the evolution of fractional Fourier transform and its discrete form, the real time computation of discrete fractional Fourier transform is essential in those applications. On this context, we have proposed new hardware architecture for implementing a Discrete Fractional Fourier Transform (DFrFT) which requires hardware complexity of O(4N), where N is transform order. This proposed architecture has been simulated and synthesized using verilogHDL, targeting a FPGA device (XLV5LX110T). The simulation results are very close to the results obtained by using MATLAB.

In the conventional GMM-UBM (Gaussian mixture model-Universal background model) based classifier, a UBM is built using feature vectors of all classes. In the proposed approach, a GMM is built for each class using the feature vectors of all the patterns of that class. Then an adapted GMM is built for each example in the training data set using the GMM built for the class to which the example belongs to. The log-likelihood of a pattern for a given example-specific adapted GMM model is used as a score. A similarity based score vector is obtained by applying a pattern to the adapted GMMs of the patterns in the training set. A test pattern is also represented using a score vector. Support vector machine is then used for classification of score vector representation of varying length patterns. Our studies on speech emotion recognition and audio clip classification tasks show that the proposed method gives a significantly improved classification performance compared to the conventional GMM based classifiers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation model","Time series analysis","Speech","Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Emotion recognition","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","pattern classification","support vector machines","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example-specific adapted Gaussian mixture models","support vector machines","varying length time series","feature vectors","score vector representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560502","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560502.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of varying length time series using example-specific adapted Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Classification of varying length time series using example-specific adapted Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560502/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560502/","accessionNumber":"11515580","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of varying length time series using example-specific adapted Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569286761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063186S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5560506,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Pei","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37268994500"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"},{"name":"Colin Cowan","affiliation":["The Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology Queen's University Belfast, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Cowan","id":"37271886100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7138-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7136-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5560506","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a 2-hop downlink point-to-multipoint fixed relay systems and propose a novel linear processing strategy at the base station and relay station to improve the reliability of the source-relay and relay-to-destination links.

The CFO introduces intercarrier interference (ICI) which degrades the accuracy of the channel estimation. To minimize this effect, we solve for the pilot sequence that minimizes the mean square error of the modified least squares (mLS) channel estimator. The transmission of this sequence results in high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signal. To solve this problem, we first introduce a new estimator as an alternative to the mLS estimator. We then design a low PAPR pilot sequence tailored to this new estimator. We show that the proposed procedure completely eliminates the effect of the ICI on the channel estimate.

A novel method consisting of a technique to refine the channel estimate at the transmitter in a ST based closed loop MIMO-OFDM system is proposed. The estimate is refined at the transmitter by making use of the previous data that was transmitted. This significantly reduces the data interference in the channel estimate and hence improves performance. Two factors in general affect all transmitter side techniques that make use of the fed back channel coefficients. One is the quantization error affecting the channel estimate.

In the quantized beamforming, each receiver chooses the best beamforming vector from the code book that has been designed using the concept of Grassmannian beamforming. Each receiver sends the label of the best beam-forming vector to the transmitter through finite rate limited feedback. Code book is shared between each transmitter-receiver pair to prevent the decoding of other users information. An expression for spectral efficiency is derived for imperfect CSIT, with the assumption that each transmitter is equipped with t antennas and each receiver with r antennas and each receiver implements single-user detection. In this work, the capacity loss due to quantized beamforming as a function of codebook size and the capacity/SINR loss due to imperfect CSIT as a function of channel estimation error are also derived and analyzed. The expressions are examined to provide interesting insights in the high and low SINR regime. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical and simulation results are presented to confirm the closeness between them.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560526.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO ad-hoc networks with quantized beamforming and imperfect channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Ad hoc networks","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","array signal processing","encoding","MIMO communication","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO ad hoc network","quantized beamforming","imperfect channel state information","network spectral efficiency","capacity analysis","multiple input multiple output ad hoc network","finite rate feedback","Grassmannian beamforming","finite rate limited feedback","code book","capacity loss"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Ad-hoc Networks","Spectral efficiency","Imperfect CSI","Beamforming","Finite rate feedback","Code book vector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MIMO ad-hoc networks with quantized beamforming and imperfect channel state information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515597","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MIMO ad-hoc networks with quantized beamforming and imperfect channel state information","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569285749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064839S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560533,"authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Oggier","affiliation":["Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","lastName":"Oggier","id":"37283997600"},{"name":"Camilla Hollanti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Camilla","lastName":"Hollanti","id":"37284021000"},{"name":"Roope Vehkalahti","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Roope","lastName":"Vehkalahti","id":"37540588400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7138-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7136-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-0608"}],"articleNumber":"5560533","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560533","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algebra","Complexity theory","Lattices","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Construction industry","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","maximum likelihood decoding","radio networks","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic MIDO-MISO code construction","wireless communications","end-user device","receive antennas","cyclic division algebra","maximum-likelihood decodability","code design criterion","nonvanishing determinant property"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input double-output (MIDO) codes are important in future wireless communications, where the portable end-user device is physically small and uses only two receive antennas. In this paper, we address the design of 4\u00d72 MIDO codes. Starting from a 4\u00d74 space-time block code matrix built from a cyclic division algebra, two ways of puncturing the code are presented, resulting in either a well-shaped MIDO code, or a MIDO code with some orthonormal columns, yielding fast maximum-likelihood (ML) decodability. The well-shaped MIDO code outperforms the fast decodable one through simulations, an indication that the shaping property stays an important code design criterion. We then provide a slightly modified version of the well-shaped MIDO code which both preserves the shaping and increases the orthogonality of its columns in an attempt to speed up the decoding of the code. Finally, we show that a multiple-input single output (MISO) code is actually embedded in the MIDO code, allowing the transmitter to choose between sending a MIDO or MISO code, without having to change the encoder.

Discrete Fourier transform filter banks (DFTFBs) are widely employed for the channelization purpose. This is because they efficiently utilize the polyphase decomposition of the prototype filter so that the prototype filter can be operated at a significantly reduced sampling rate. However DFTFBs suffer from the drawback that they can be employed only for the extraction of channels of uniform bandwidths. In this paper, a new DFTFB is presented which can be reconfigured with minimal overhead to extract channels of different bandwidths. The proposed DFTFB consists of a prototype filter which employs the concept of coefficient decimation for obtaining different passband widths. From the analysis of the architecture, it is clear that the overhead in the proposed filter bank is only few extra adders when compared to the conventional uniform DFTFB. Implementations results show that the proposed filter bank offers area and power reductions of 54% and 42% and speed improvement of 30.5% over conventional DFTFB respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable discrete Fourier transform filter banks for multi-standard channelizers","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560538","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560538.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable discrete Fourier transform filter banks for multi-standard channelizers","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560538/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515609","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable discrete Fourier transform filter banks for multi-standard channelizers","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569284619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069708S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560544,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Trivedi","affiliation":["Department of ICT, ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37544703600"},{"name":"M.

MIMO can increase network throughput via suppressing interference from neighboring links and/or allowing transmission of multiple independent data streams over MIMO antenna elements. However, these throughput gains are limited unless higher layer protocols also exploit these capacities. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing the benefits of spatial reuse and spatial multiplexing capabilities of MIMO in WMNs. We formulate a joint rate allocation, routing, and stream control problem in MIMO enabled WMNs. Our objective is to find a rate allocation such that the network throughput is maximized. As going only for throughput maximization may result in a severe bias on rate allocation, we also define a proportional fair rate allocation problem. Simulation results show that the proportional fair rate allocation scheme achieves a good tradeoff between throughput and fairness. It is also shown that the network throughput increases linearly as the number of antenna increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560544.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair end-to-end rate allocation and stream control in MIMO-based WMNs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Resource management","Interference","Antennas","Wireless communication","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference suppression","MIMO communication","space division multiplexing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proportional fair end-to-end rate allocation","MIMO-based WMN","wireless mesh network","multiple input multiple output system","interference suppression","multiple independent data stream control problem","MIMO antenna","higher layer protocols","spatial multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless mesh network","cross-layer optimization","convex programming","rate control","routing","stream control","fairness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fair end-to-end rate allocation and stream control in MIMO-based WMNs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560544/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515515","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair end-to-end rate allocation and stream control in MIMO-based WMNs","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569283989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061235S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560551,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Srinivas","affiliation":["IIIT-H, Communication Research Center, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Srinivas","id":"38468481600"},{"name":"V.

Unlike standard phased array (SIMO) radar that transmits scaled versions of a single waveform from its many transmit antennas, a MIMO radar can transmit distinct waveforms from each antenna. Such an increase in the number of degrees of freedom for waveform design can potentially be used to obtain beamforming performance similar to SIMO radars with a far fewer total number of transmit and receive antennas. In recent literature, the problem of finding a signal correlation matrix that achieves a desired transmit beam pattern has been addressed, but a closed form solution for this problem has been lacking. In this paper, we first formulate a new spatial ambiguity function that simultaneously specifies the transmit beam pattern as well as the cross-correlation beam pattern. We then provide a closed form solution for the signal correlation matrix whose spatial ambiguity function is closest to a desired function (in the mean square sense), when using colocated uniform linear arrays.

The subband signals derived using CHWT are of real nature due to DCT. This enables to obtain the estimate of the overall plant impulse response in the DCT domain and hence is simple compared to that of difficult stacking used in delayless SAF realized by DFT filter banks. Further the aliasing due to filtering is absent as subband signals are derived in DCT domain and hence critical sampling is sufficient. This does not suffer from eigen value spread, due to over sampling used to avoid aliasing. The wavelet nature in addition to handling nonstationarity provides the perception. Hence, the new algorithm is simple and provides good convergence rate for signals with large eigenvalue spread and of nonstationary nature.","doi":"10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560553","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications (SPCOM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552578/5560454/05560553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPCOM.2010.5560553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560454","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new Delayless subband adaptive filter based on Discrete Cosine Harmonic Wavelet Transform (CHWT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new Delayless subband adaptive filter based on Discrete Cosine Harmonic Wavelet Transform (CHWT)","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560553/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515524","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560553/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new Delayless subband adaptive filter based on Discrete Cosine Harmonic Wavelet Transform (CHWT)","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569280543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074503S","chronDate":"18-21 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552578","isNumber":"5560454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552578","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560454","articleId":"5560553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5560559,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The channel management decision in a cognitive radio system depends on various factors such as government regulations, limitations of transmission power between communicating devices, availability of geo-location information, and the quality of various available channels. The main purpose of channel management in a cognitive radio system is to protect the incumbent users (licensed users). The first international standard based on cognitive radio technology is IEEE 802.22, Wireless Regional Area Networks, which aims at providing broadband access in rural areas by effectively utilizing the unused TV channels. This standard aims at describing both PHY and MAC layer functionalities in an infrastructure- based broadband wireless access network for communication between consumer premises equipment using a base station. This article presents the cognitive radio functionality of this standard in detail. The cognitive functionality is provided by the dynamic channel management using channel sensing, channel classification, and maintenance of channel information. Using these techniques, this standard effectively protects the incumbent users and dynamically manages the channel allocation in IEEE 802.22 WRAN systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5560592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560574","startPage":"88","endPage":"94","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5560574/05560592.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel management in IEEE 802.22 WRAN systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560592/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Channel management in IEEE 802.22 WRAN systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11512787","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel management in IEEE 802.22 WRAN systems","sourcePdf":"018FRANKLIN-LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062829S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5560574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5560574","articleId":"5560592","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560593,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik R.

Cognitive radio is a technology capable of advancing wireless communications to the next generation of intelligent devices. Integrating cognition into wireless applications such as dynamic spectrum access, radio resource management, wireless distributed computing, and even traditional protocol stacks has already been shown to provide benefits related to the communications quality of service. The majority of cognitive radio related research has been limited to theoretical frameworks and simulations or in a few cases, demonstrating prototype DSA devices on a small scale. In order to continue advancing in this area, larger-scale experiments that are reproducible and able to be moved beyond theoretical simulations are required. Virginia Tech has built a testbed for software-defined and cognitive radio related research for the purpose of rapid next-generation communication system prototyping using a medium scale size network of flexible wireless nodes. In this article we present the details of the development, design decision rationale, and deployment of this testbed in hopes that it will be both used by the research community, and duplicated and improved in order to further the development of the many different facets of cognitive radio research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"48","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11512789","htmlLink":"/document/5560594/","displayDocTitle":"Designing and deploying a building-wide cognitive radio network testbed","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing and deploying a building-wide cognitive radio network testbed","sourcePdf":"020NEWMAN-LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04352S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5560574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5560574","articleId":"5560594","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560595,"authors":[{"name":"Paul D.

At the same time, service providers need to comply with Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts which determine the revenues and penalties on the basis of the achieved performance level. This paper focuses on the resource allocation problem in multitier virtualized systems with the goal of maximizing the SLAs revenue while minimizing energy costs. The main novelty of our approach is to address-in a unifying framework-service centers resource management by exploiting as actuation mechanisms allocation of virtual machines (VMs) to servers, load balancing, capacity allocation, server power state tuning, and dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. Resource management is modeled as an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and solved by a local search procedure. To validate its effectiveness, the proposed model is compared to top-performing state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation is based on simulation and on real experiments performed in a prototype environment. Synthetic as well as realistic workloads and a number of different scenarios of interest are considered. Results show that we are able to yield significant revenue gains for the provider when compared to alternative methods (up to 45 percent). Moreover, solutions are robust to service time and workload variations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2012","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12571642","htmlLink":"/document/5560637/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Autonomic Resource Allocation in Multitier Virtualized Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Autonomic Resource Allocation in Multitier Virtualized Environments","sourcePdf":"tsc2012010002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046527S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2012","isNumber":"6159224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"117","articleId":"5560637","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560639,"authors":[{"name":"Zine Abid","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, SUNY at Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5721121/5560639/5560639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Z.

Often energy saving and path duration and stability can be two contrasting efforts and trying to satisfy both of them can be very difficult. In this paper, a novel routing strategy is proposed. This proposed approach tries to account for link stability and for minimum drain rate energy consumption. In order to verify the correctness of the proposed solution a biobjective optimization formulation has been designed and a novel routing protocol called Link-stAbility and Energy aware Routing protocols (LAER) is proposed. This novel routing scheme has been compared with other three protocols: PERRA, GPSR, and E-GPSR. The protocol performance has been evaluated in terms of Data Packet Delivery Ratio, Normalized Control Overhead, Link duration, Nodes lifetime, and Average energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6163459/05560644.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link-Stability and Energy Aware Routing Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560644/","displayDocTitle":"Link-Stability and Energy Aware Routing Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks","volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12571559","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560644/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link-Stability and Energy Aware Routing Protocol in Distributed Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2012040713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104971S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6163459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6163459","articleId":"5560644","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5560648,"authors":[{"name":"Renchu Guan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, Changchun, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5715919/5560648/5560648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renchu Guan received the BSc degree in computer science and technology and the MSc degree in computer applied technology in 2004 and 2007 from Northeast Normal University, China, respectively.

There are two main contributions in our approach: 1) a new similarity metric that captures the structural information of texts, and 2) a novel seed construction method to improve the semisupervised clustering process. To study the performance of the new algorithm, we applied it to the benchmark data set Reuters-21578 and compared it to two state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, namely, k-means algorithm and the original AP algorithm. Furthermore, we have analyzed the individual impact of the two proposed contributions. Results show that the proposed similarity metric is more effective in text clustering (F-measures ca. 21 percent higher than in the AP algorithm) and the proposed semisupervised strategy achieves both better clustering results and faster convergence (using only 76 percent iterations of the original AP). The complete SAP algorithm obtains higher F-measure (ca. 40 percent improvement over k-means and AP) and lower entropy (ca. 28 percent decrease over k-means and AP), improves significantly clustering execution time (20 times faster) in respect that k-means, and provides enhanced robustness compared with all other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560648/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11847722","htmlLink":"/document/5560648/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Text Clustering with Seeds Affinity Propagation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Text Clustering with Seeds Affinity Propagation","sourcePdf":"ttk2011040627.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096413S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5715919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5715919","articleId":"5560648","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560652,"authors":[{"name":"Parisa Rashidi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5715919/5560652/5560652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Parisa Rashidi received the BSc degree in computer engineering from the University of Tehran, Iran, in 2005, and the MSc degree in computer science from Washington State University, where she worked on CASAS Project as the master's thesis.

In order to monitor the functional health of smart home residents, we need to design technologies that recognize and track activities that people normally perform as part of their daily routines. Although approaches do exist for recognizing activities, the approaches are applied to activities that have been preselected and for which labeled training data are available. In contrast, we introduce an automated approach to activity tracking that identifies frequent activities that naturally occur in an individual's routine. With this capability, we can then track the occurrence of regular activities to monitor functional health and to detect changes in an individual's patterns and lifestyle. In this paper, we describe our activity mining and tracking approach, and validate our algorithms on data collected in physical smart environments.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5715919/05560652.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715919","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Activities to Recognize and Track in a Smart Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Activities to Recognize and Track in a Smart Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560652/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11832616","pubMedId":"21617742","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Activities to Recognize and Track in a Smart Environment","sourcePdf":"ttk2011040527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121295S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5715919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"312","xplore-issue":"5715919","articleId":"5560652","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":5560655,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Kamra","affiliation":["Candidate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5753264/5560655/5560655-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashish Kamra received the BE degree in electronics from VNIT, India, in 2001.

We propose the notion of database response policies to support our intrusion response system tailored for a DBMS. Our interactive response policy language makes it very easy for the database administrators to specify appropriate response actions for different circumstances depending upon the nature of the anomalous request. The two main issues that we address in context of such response policies are that of policy matching, and policy administration. For the policy matching problem, we propose two algorithms that efficiently search the policy database for policies that match an anomalous request. We also extend the PostgreSQL DBMS with our policy matching mechanism, and report experimental results. The experimental evaluation shows that our techniques are very efficient. The other issue that we address is that of administration of response policies to prevent malicious modifications to policy objects from legitimate users. We propose a novel Joint Threshold Administration Model (JTAM) that is based on the principle of separation of duty. The key idea in JTAM is that a policy object is jointly administered by at least k database administrator (DBAs), that is, any modification made to a policy object will be invalid unless it has been authorized by at least k DBAs. We present design details of JTAM which is based on a cryptographic threshold signature scheme, and show how JTAM prevents malicious modifications to policy objects from authorized users. We also implement JTAM in the PostgreSQL DBMS, and report experimental results on the efficiency of our techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5753264/05560655.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Intrusion Response System for Relational Databases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560655/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Intrusion Response System for Relational Databases","volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11961120","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560655/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an Intrusion Response System for Relational Databases","sourcePdf":"ttk2011060875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08792S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5753264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5753264","articleId":"5560655","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560660,"authors":[{"name":"Ninad Thakoor","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5739148/5560660/5560660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ninad Thakoor (S\u201904-M\u201910) received the BE degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the University of Mumbai, India, in 2001, and the MS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

Classical approaches of branch-and-bound based clustering search through combinations of various partitioning possibilities to optimize a clustering cost. However, these approaches are not practically useful for clustering of image data where the size of data is large. Additionally, the number of clusters is unknown in most of the image data analysis problems. By taking advantage of the spatial coherency of clusters, we formulate an innovative branch-and-bound approach, which solves clustering problem as a model-selection problem. In this generalized approach, cluster parameter candidates are first generated by spatially coherent sampling. A branch-and-bound search is carried out through the candidates to select an optimal subset. This paper formulates this approach and investigates its average computational complexity. Improved clustering quality and robustness to outliers compared to conventional iterative approach are demonstrated with experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.156","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5739148/05560660.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"655","endPage":"668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Branch-and-Bound for Model Selection and Its Computational Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Branch-and-Bound for Model Selection and Its Computational Complexity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560660/","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5560660/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11883418","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Branch-and-Bound for Model Selection and Its Computational Complexity","sourcePdf":"ttk2011050655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083743S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5739148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5739148","articleId":"5560660","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560664,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Zhou","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5692135/5560664/5560664-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhong Zhou received the BEng degree in telecommunication engineering in 2000 and the MEng degree in computer science in 2003, both from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.

In this paper, by utilizing the predictable mobility patterns of underwater objects, we propose a scheme, called Scalable Localization scheme with Mobility Prediction (SLMP), for underwater sensor networks. In SLMP, localization is performed in a hierarchical way, and the whole localization process is divided into two parts: anchor node localization and ordinary node localization. During the localization process, every node predicts its future mobility pattern according to its past known location information, and it can estimate its future location based on the predicted mobility pattern. Anchor nodes with known locations in the network will control the localization process in order to balance the trade-off between localization accuracy, localization coverage, and communication cost. We conduct extensive simulations, and our results show that SLMP can greatly reduce localization communication cost while maintaining relatively high localization coverage and localization accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5560664/","accessionNumber":"11759758","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Localization with Mobility Prediction for Underwater Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Localization with Mobility Prediction for Underwater Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011030335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088663S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5692135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5692135","articleId":"5560664","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5560666,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik R.

However, the available spectrum changes dynamically with the primary user (PU) activity, necessitating frequent PU sensing coordination and exchanging network topology information in a multihop CR ad hoc network. To facilitate these tasks, an always-on, out-of-band common control channel (CCC) design is proposed that uses noncontiguous OFDM subcarriers placed within the guard bands separating the channels of the licensed spectrum. First, the task of choosing the OFDM-specific parameters, including the number, power, and bandwidth of the subcarriers is formulated as a feasibility problem to ensure that the CCC does not adversely interfere with the PU operation. Second, for unicast messaging between a given pair of users, a subset of the guard bands may be chosen, which allows an additional measure of protection for the adjacent PU spectrum. For this, the multiarm bandit algorithm is used that allows the guard band selection to evolve over time based on the observed interference from the PU. Results reveal that our proposed CCC ensures connectivity and improved PU protection with a limited trade-off in data rate when compared to frequency-hopping and cluster-based CCC schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5671529/05560666.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5671529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM-Based Common Control Channel Design for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560666/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM-Based Common Control Channel Design for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698245","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560666/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM-Based Common Control Channel Design for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011020228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101316S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5671529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5671529","articleId":"5560666","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560674,"authors":[{"name":"Ali A.

Security experts need to know code locations on which to focus their testing and inspection efforts. Since vulnerabilities are rare occurrences, locating vulnerable code locations can be a challenging task. We investigated whether software metrics obtained from source code and development history are discriminative and predictive of vulnerable code locations. If so, security experts can use this prediction to prioritize security inspection and testing efforts. The metrics we investigated fall into three categories: complexity, code churn, and developer activity metrics. We performed two empirical case studies on large, widely used open-source projects: the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel. The results indicate that 24 of the 28 metrics collected are discriminative of vulnerabilities for both projects. The models using all three types of metrics together predicted over 80 percent of the known vulnerable files with less than 25 percent false positives for both projects. Compared to a random selection of files for inspection and testing, these models would have reduced the number of files and the number of lines of code to inspect or test by over 71 and 28 percent, respectively, for both projects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/6095279/05560680.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2010.81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2010.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating Complexity, Code Churn, and Developer Activity Metrics as Indicators of Software Vulnerabilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Software security","Complexity theory","Predictive models","Charge coupled devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Linux","online front-ends","program testing","public domain software","software fault tolerance","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code churn","software vulnerabilities","developer activity metrics","security inspection","software metrics","source code","vulnerable code locations","open-source projects","Mozilla Firefox Web browser","Red Hat enterprise Linux kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault prediction","software metrics","software security","vulnerability prediction."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating Complexity, Code Churn, and Developer Activity Metrics as Indicators of Software Vulnerabilities","volume":"37","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5560680/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12391415","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating Complexity, Code Churn, and Developer Activity Metrics as Indicators of Software Vulnerabilities","sourcePdf":"tts2011060772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130843S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6095279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"6095279","articleId":"5560680","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560681,"authors":[{"name":"Marie Hicks","affiliation":["Duke University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/85/5639117/5560681/5560681-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marie Hicks is a visiting assistant professor at Duke University and is the managing editor for the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences.

Therefore, it is possible to provision a lightpath, while its quality of transmission (QoT) does not meet the required threshold. Considering the physical layer impairments in the network planning phase gives rise to a set of offline Impairments Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) algorithms. There are very few offline IA-RWA algorithms that consider dedicated path protection demands. In this work we propose a novel offline IA-RWA algorithm, called Rahyab and perform a comparative performance evaluation study, which considers two enhanced algorithms from the literature. Simulation results indicates that demand pre-processing, diverse routing, and adaptive wavelength assignment are the main reasons of lower blocking rate of Rahyab algorithm compared to the selected algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Offline Physical Layer Impairments Aware RWA Algorithm With Dedicated Path Protection Consideration","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2072905","endPage":"3040","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5586669/05560683.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"3029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2072905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586669","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560683","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical layer","Heuristic algorithms","Q factor","Wavelength assignment","Optimization","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","performance evaluation","telecommunication network routing","wavelength assignment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["offline physical layer impairments","dedicated path protection consideration","transparent optical networks","quality of transmission","network planning phase","offline impairments aware routing","wavelength assignment algorithms","IA-RWA algorithms","dedicated path protection demands","performance evaluation study","demand pre-processing","diverse routing","adaptive wavelength assignment","Rahyab algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dedicated path protection","impairments aware RWA","physical layer impairments","routing and wavelength assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Offline Physical Layer Impairments Aware RWA Algorithm With Dedicated Path Protection Consideration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560683/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2010","volume":"28","issue":"20","htmlLink":"/document/5560683/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11568249","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Offline Physical Layer Impairments Aware RWA Algorithm With Dedicated Path Protection Consideration","sourcePdf":"jlt-azodolmolky-2072905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095523S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5586669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5586669","articleId":"5560683","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560686,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Detection of a single 40 Gb/s dual-polarization QPSK channel is achieved within a band of up to 17 WDM channels using a receiver with real-time digital signal processing and without optical demultiplexing. Measurements are presented of the performance in a back-to-back configuration as well as after transmission over 400 km of standard single-mode fiber. The dependence of the coincident channels' interference on various parameters, such as the net chromatic dispersion and the orientation of the coincident channels' polarization tributaries relative to the receiver polarizer, is explored. We also investigate using a single interfering channel with its power appropriately scaled to represent multiple interfering channels as an alternative configuration for evaluating receiver performance. The single-interferer approach has significant disadvantages including increased polarization sensitivity and different scaling of the interference term arising from the channel-channel beating compared to true multi-channel interference.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2071853","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5586669/05560686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2071853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586669","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of a Single 40 Gb/s Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK Channel With a Real-Time Intradyne Receiver in the Presence of Multiple Coincident WDM Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of a Single 40 Gb/s Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK Channel With a Real-Time Intradyne Receiver in the Presence of Multiple Coincident WDM Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560686/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"20","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11574237","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560686/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of a Single 40 Gb/s Polarization-Multiplexed QPSK Channel With a Real-Time Intradyne Receiver in the Presence of Multiple Coincident WDM Channels","sourcePdf":"jlt-nelson-2071853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08704S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5586669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5586669","articleId":"5560686","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560688,"authors":[{"name":"Kun-Yii Tu","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kun-Yii Tu (M'03) received the B.S. degree from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, in 1979, the M.Sc. degree from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree from Polytechnic Institute of New York University, New York, in 1992, all in electrical engineering.","His academic research involved high-temperature microwave applicator design and electromagnetic diffraction theory.

Due to the harshness, anomaly events such as adversarial intrusions may result in harmful and disastrous situations for industrial applications but it is difficult to detect them over wireless medium. Intrusion detection is an essential requirement for security, but as far as we know, there have not been such studies for wireless industrial sensor networks in the literature. The previous intrusion detection methods proposed for wireless sensor networks consider networks rather in general senses and restrict capabilities to specific attacks only. In this paper, we first study intrusion detection for wireless industrial sensor networks, through various experiments and design of a hierarchical framework. We classify and select better methodologies against various intrusions. Subsequently, we find novel results on the previous methodologies. We also propose a new hierarchical framework for intrusion detection as well as data processing. Throughout the experiments on the proposed framework, we stress the significance of one-hop clustering, which was neglected in the previous studies. Finally, we construct required logical protocols in the hierarchical framework; hierarchical intrusion detection and prevention protocols.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5605856/05560697.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2010.2051556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2010.2051556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Experimental Study of Hierarchical Intrusion Detection for Wireless Industrial Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Protocols","Intrusion detection","Monitoring","Wireless communication","Communication system security","Industry applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical intrusion detection","wireless industrial sensor network","intrusion prevention"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","industrial applications","intrusion detection","intrusion prevention","wireless industrial sensor network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Experimental Study of Hierarchical Intrusion Detection for Wireless Industrial Sensor Networks","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5560697/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629729","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Experimental Study of Hierarchical Intrusion Detection for Wireless Industrial Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tii-tkwon-2051556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193154S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5605856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5605856","articleId":"5560697","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560700,"authors":[{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5599391/5560700/5560700-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daehyun Kang received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2006, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea.","His main interests are RF circuits for wireless communications, especially highly efficient and linear RF transmitters and RF PA design."]},"firstName":"Daehyun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37289143600"},{"name":"Dongsu Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5599391/5560700/5560700-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Dongsu Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at POSTECH.","His research interests are CMOS RF circuits for wireless communications, with a special focus on highly efficient and linear RF transmitter design."]},"firstName":"Dongsu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37068059400"},{"name":"Jinsung Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5599391/5560700/5560700-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsung Choi received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2004 and in 2010, respectively.","He is currently with the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT), Yongin-si, Korea.

A linear broadband class-F amplifier is designed to have a constant fundamental impedance across 1.7-2 GHz and its second and third harmonic impedances are located at the high-efficiency area. To reduce the circuit size for handset application, the harmonic control circuits are merged into the broadband output matching circuit for the fundamental frequency. An envelope-tracking operation delivers high efficiency for the overall power. The linearity is improved by envelope tracking (ET) through intermodulation-distortion sweet-spot tracking at the maximum output power level. The efficiency and bandwidth (BW) are enhanced by a boosted supply modulator. Multimode operation is achieved by an ET technique with a programmable hysteresis control and automatic switching current adaptation of the hybrid supply modulator. For demonstration purpose, the PA and supply modulator are implemented using an InGaP/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor and a 65-nm CMOS process. For a long-term evolution signal, the envelope-tracking (ET) PA delivers a power-added efficiency (PAE) and an error vector magnitude of 33.3%-39% and 2.5%-3.5%, respectively, at an average power of 27.8 dBm across 1.7-2 GHz. For a wideband code-division multiple-access signal across 1.7-2 GHz, the ET PA performs a PAE, an ACLR1, and an ACLR2 of 40%-46.3%, from -39 to -42.5\u00a0dBc, and -51 to -58\u00a0dBc, respectively, at an average output power of 30.1 dBm. The ET PA with an EDGE signal delivers a PAE, an ACPR1, and an ACPR2 of 37%-42%, from -56.5 to -59.3\u00a0dBc, and -63.5 to -69.5\u00a0dBc, respectively, at an average power of 28 dBm across the 300-MHz BW. These results show that the proposed design achieves highly efficient and linear power amplification for multimode/multiband wireless communication applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5599391/05560700.pdf","startPage":"2598","endPage":"2608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2063851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2063851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multimode/Multiband Power Amplifier With a Boosted Supply Modulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Modulation","Broadband communication","Impedance","Switches","Capacitance","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance","gallium arsenide","harmonic generation","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","power amplifiers","telephone sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimode/multiband power amplifier","boosted supply modulator","handset applications","linear broadband","class-F amplifier","second harmonic impedances","third harmonic impedances","harmonic control circuits","broadband output matching circuit","intermodulation-distortion","sweet-spot tracking","programmable hysteresis control","automatic switching current adaptation","hybrid supply modulator","heterojunction bipolar transistor","CMOS process","frequency 1.7 GHz to 2 GHz","InGaP-GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Efficient","enhanced data rates for GSM evolution (EDGE)","envelope tracking (ET)","handset","heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT)","linear","long-term evolution (LTE)","monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)","power amplifier (PA)","supply modulator","wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Multimode/Multiband Power Amplifier With a Boosted Supply Modulator","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5560700/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575367","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multimode/Multiband Power Amplifier With a Boosted Supply Modulator","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2063851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114027S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5599391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5599391","articleId":"5560700","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560701,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Knochenhauer","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5599391/5560701/5560701-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Knochenhauer received the Dipl.-Ing. degree from the Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree from Ecole Centrale Paris, Paris, France in 2008, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at Dresden University of Technology, Germany.","His research interest is amplifier circuit design for high-speed optical communication systems.","Mr. Knochenhauer was the recipient of a Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes scholarship (2001\u2013 2007) and the 2008 Werner von Siemens Excellence Award.

The use of a high-mobility bilayer oxide TFT with scaled gate length is still valid for reducing low-frequency noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5584935/05560723.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1130","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/LED.2010.2059694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2010.2059694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584935","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Frequency Noise Performance of a Bilayer InZnO\u2013InGaZnO Thin-Film Transistor for Analog Device Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thin film transistors","Logic gates","Low-frequency noise","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","gallium compounds","II-VI semiconductors","indium compounds","thin film transistors","wide band gap semiconductors","zinc compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilayer thin film transistor","analog device","low-frequency noise performance","normalized noise","bilayer oxide TFT","single-layer oxide TFT","thin interfacial layer","carrier number fluctuation","InZnO-InGaZnO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog device applications","bilayer oxide semiconductor","electron devices","noise performance","thin-film devices","thin-film transistor (TFT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-Frequency Noise Performance of a Bilayer InZnO\u2013InGaZnO Thin-Film Transistor for Analog Device Applications","volume":"31","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5560723/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534940","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Frequency Noise Performance of a Bilayer InZnO\u2013InGaZnO Thin-Film Transistor for Analog Device Applications","sourcePdf":"led-park-2059694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217496S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5584935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5584935","articleId":"5560723","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560732,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37533992800"},{"name":"Yonggang Chi","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yonggang","lastName":"Chi","id":"37290837200"},{"name":"Naitong Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Naitong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288734600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5560732","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":773},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Fourier transforms","Filtering","Optical filters","Time domain analysis","Chirp","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel sampling","bandlimited signals","fractional Fourier domain","spectral leakage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractional bandlimited signal","fractional filter","fractional Fourier transform","multichannel sampling theorem"]}],"abstract":"The classical multichannel sampling theorem for common bandlimited signals has been extended differently to fractional bandlimited signals associated with the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT).

The theorem which is constructed by the ordinary convolution in the time domain can reduce the effect of spectral leakage and is easy to implement. The classical multichannel sampling theorem and the well-known sampling theorem for the FRFT are shown to be special cases of it. Some potential applications of this theorem are also presented.

A different criterion which has been found to be useful especially in the field of multicarrier communications is the Signal-to-Distortion Noise Ratio (SDNR), which is based on the BUSSGANG decomposition of the output of the nonlinearity. It is shown that the SDNR optimum coincides with the minimum MSE solution, which simplifies the optimization of memoryless nonlinear functions with respect to SDNR.

There is no need to provide a precise definition of the walls in terms of their material electrical parameters and roughness. The wall properties are efficiently described using just three probabilistic parameters that can be calibrated by measurements.

Online gaming has become one of the most popular Internet activities in recent years, but cheating activity, such as the use of game bots, has increased as a consequence. Generally, the gaming community disapproves of the use of bots, as users may obtain unreasonable rewards without making corresponding efforts. However, game bots are hard to detect because they are designed to simulate human game playing behavior and they follow game rules exactly. Existing methods cannot solve the problem as the differences between bot and human trajectories are generally hard to describe. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting game bots based on some dissimilarity measurements between the trajectories of either bots or human users. The measurements are combined with manifold learning and classification techniques for detection; and the approach is generalizable to any game in which avatars' movements are controlled by the players directly. Through real-life data traces, we observe that the trajectories of bots and humans are very different. Since certain human behavior patterns are difficult to mimic, the characteristic can be used as a signature for bot detection. To evaluate the proposed scheme's performance, we conduct a case study of a popular online game called Quake 2. The results show that the scheme can achieve a high detection rate or classification accuracy on a short trace of several hundred seconds.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/5571836/05560779.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2072506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2072506","startPage":"162","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Bot Detection via Avatar Trajectory Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560779/","displayDocTitle":"Game Bot Detection via Avatar Trajectory Analysis","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560779/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11523404","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Bot Detection via Avatar Trajectory Analysis","sourcePdf":"tciaig-pao-2072506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086905S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"5571836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5571836","articleId":"5560779","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5560780,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Ueno","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Ueno","id":"37291569200"},{"name":"Tetsuya Hirose","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37267176000"},{"name":"Tetsuya Asai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Asai","id":"37272096200"},{"name":"Yoshihito Amemiya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihito","lastName":"Amemiya","id":"37273844900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5560780","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2770},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Temperature measurement","CMOS integrated circuits","Threshold voltage","Temperature dependence","Temperature","Resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","MOSFET circuits","reference circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current reference circuit","subthreshold CMOS circuits","MOSFET circuits","temperature effect","threshold voltage","temperature coefficient","line regulation","power 1 muW","size 0.35 mum","current 100 nA","temperature 0 degC to 80 degC","voltage 1.8 V to 3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS)","current reference","power-aware large-scale integrations (LSIs)","self-biasing circuit","subthreshold region","temperature dependence","ultralow power","weak inversion"]}],"abstract":"A low-power CMOS current reference circuit was developed using a 0.35-\u03bcm standard CMOS process technology.

Traditionally, each particle utilizes its historical best experience and its neighborhood's best experience through linear summation. Such a learning strategy is easy to use, but is inefficient when searching in complex problem spaces. Hence, designing learning strategies that can utilize previous search information (experience) more efficiently has become one of the most salient and active PSO research topics. In this paper, we proposes an orthogonal learning (OL) strategy for PSO to discover more useful information that lies in the above two experiences via orthogonal experimental design. We name this PSO as orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO). The OL strategy can guide particles to fly in better directions by constructing a much promising and efficient exemplar. The OL strategy can be applied to PSO with any topological structure. In this paper, it is applied to both global and local versions of PSO, yielding the OLPSO-G and OLPSO-L algorithms, respectively. This new learning strategy and the new algorithms are tested on a set of 16 benchmark functions, and are compared with other PSO algorithms and some state of the art evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed learning strategy and algorithms. The comparisons show that OLPSO significantly improves the performance of PSO, offering faster global convergence, higher solution quality, and stronger robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388449","htmlLink":"/document/5560790/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Learning Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Learning Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-jzhang-2052054-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163725S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6087309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"473","xplore-issue":"6087309","articleId":"5560790","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5560795,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Some experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2071050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2071050","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5639224/05560795.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5639224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Dimming Technique for Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Dimming Technique for Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560795/","accessionNumber":"11655455","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560795/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Dimming Technique for Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp","sourcePdf":"tia-hwu-2071050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076742S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5639224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5639224","articleId":"5560795","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560801,"authors":[{"name":"Liqing Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5639224/5560801/5560801-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liqing Lu received the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","Her research is mainly concerned with physical modeling, simulation, and characterization of power semiconductor devices with P-i-N diodes and IGBTs as main interests under both forward conduction and turn-on/turn-off transient conditions."]},"firstName":"Liqing","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280213900"},{"name":"Angus Bryant","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5639224/5560801/5560801-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Angus Bryant (S'02\u2013M'06) received the M.Eng. degree in electrical and information sciences and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from Queens' College, Cambridge University, Cambridge, U.K., in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He was a Research Fellow in the School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K., where he worked on power device modelling.

The model parameters of the actual system are extracted, and the modeling results are compared with measurements. Through the developed model, it is seen that the system can transfer power over a midrange of a few meters and that impedance matching is important to achieve high efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05560805.pdf","startPage":"2906","endPage":"2914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2072893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2072893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-Model-Based Analysis of a Wireless Energy-Transfer System via Coupled Magnetic Resonances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Couplings","Mathematical model","Magnetic resonance","Loss measurement","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","equivalent circuits","impedance matching","inductive power transmission","magnetic resonance","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit-model-based analysis","wireless energy-transfer system","coupled magnetic resonances","equivalent-circuit model","node equations","electric-design automation tool","power transfer","impedance matching","wireless power-transmission systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy transfer","magnetic resonance","model","wireless"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-Model-Based Analysis of a Wireless Energy-Transfer System via Coupled Magnetic Resonances","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5560805/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049292","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-Model-Based Analysis of a Wireless Energy-Transfer System via Coupled Magnetic Resonances","sourcePdf":"tie-cheon-2072893-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086679S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5560805","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560809,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Feng Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5560809/5560809-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Feng Juang (M'99\u2013SM'08) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1993 and 1997, respectively.","Since 2001, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU), Taichung, Taiwan, where he has been a Distinguished Professor since 2009.

The controller that coordinates the leg movements consists of fully connected recurrent neural networks (FCRNNs). To automate the FCRNN parameter design, a symbiotic species-based particle swarm optimization (SSPSO) algorithm is proposed. There are multiple swarms in the SSPSO, where a swarm only optimizes the relevant parameters to a single node. The number of swarms is equal to the number of nodes in an FCRNN. The symbiotic behavior of particles from different swarms corresponds to the symbiotic structure of different nodes in an FCRNN. For a particle update, particles in different swarms update independently using a local version of particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on speciation. In each swarm, species are formed adaptively in each iteration according to both particle distance and performance. The design of FCRNNs using the SSPSO for temporal sequence generation and hexapod robot dynamic gait evolution for forward movement is conducted. For the latter, a multiple-FCRNN controller is first designed using a simulated hexapod robot. The designed controller is then successfully applied to a real hexapod robot gait control. The SSPSO is compared with the genetic algorithm and different PSO algorithms to verify its efficiency and effectiveness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","volume":"58","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049295","htmlLink":"/document/5560809/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolving Gaits of a Hexapod Robot by Recurrent Neural Networks With Symbiotic Species-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving Gaits of a Hexapod Robot by Recurrent Neural Networks With Symbiotic Species-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tie-juang-2072892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128828S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5560809","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560810,"authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Marignetti","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Cassino, Cassino, Frosinone, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5560810/5560810-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabrizio Marignetti (M'00\u2013SM'08) received the Laurea degree (with honors) and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d Naples, Italy, in 1993 and 1998, respectively.","In 1998, he joined the University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy, where he is currently an Associate Professor of power electronic converters, electrical machines, and drives and has been lecturing on electrical machines, electric vehicles, generators, and converters for renewable energies since 1996.

The controller takes into account the discrete states of the voltage source inverter (VSI), and the current errors are predicted for each sampling period. Voltage vectors are selected by a graph algorithm, whereby the most appropriate vector is chosen based on an optimization criterion. However, this depends on whether the state of the system is transient or steady. In the first case, the current error should be minimized as fast as possible in order to obtain fast dynamics. In the latter one, the VSI switching behavior is optimized since the switching losses account for a large amount of the total converter losses in high-power drive systems. MPDCC has been developed for a general neutral-point isolated resistive-inductive load with an internal voltage source. For demonstration, the presented control strategy has been implemented on a small-scale permanent-magnet synchronous machine drive system with a two-level VSI. This new approach has several advantages. The most important one is that the switching frequency is reduced up to 70% compared to linear control combined with pulsewidth modulation. Second, MPDCC obtains fast dynamic responses, which are already known from, e.g., direct torque control.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2072894","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05560812.pdf","startPage":"2826","endPage":"2835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2072894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching Frequency Reduction Using Model Predictive Direct Current Control for High-Power Voltage Source Inverters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560812/","displayDocTitle":"Switching Frequency Reduction Using Model Predictive Direct Current Control for High-Power Voltage Source Inverters","volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049296","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560812/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching Frequency Reduction Using Model Predictive Direct Current Control for High-Power Voltage Source Inverters","sourcePdf":"tie-schaltz-2072894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055845S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5560812","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560814,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Wang","affiliation":[" PHM Centre, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5560814/5560814-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenbin Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, the M.Sc. degree in operations management from the Xi'an University of Engineering and Technology, Xi'an, China, and the Ph.D. degree in operational research and applied statistics from the University of Salford, Salford, U.K.","He was a Lecturer with the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin.

One of the techniques for PHM is the use of a canary: an early-warning device derived from the use of a canary bird to detect the presence of poisonous gases in a mineshaft. This paper proposes a cost-based decision model to evaluate the economic benefit of the use of canary devices and the optimal replacement time of a canary-equipped system if the canary issues a warning. This paper also discusses the influence of scheduled preventive maintenance on the replacement policy of a canary-equipped system. The model is demonstrated with an example from the aviation industry.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2072897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05560814.pdf","startPage":"3077","endPage":"3089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2072897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic Analysis of Canary-Based Prognostics and Health Management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560814/","displayDocTitle":"Economic Analysis of Canary-Based Prognostics and Health Management","volume":"58","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049298","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560814/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic Analysis of Canary-Based Prognostics and Health Management","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2072897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13923S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5560814","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560817,"authors":[{"name":"Fangjun Huang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5623286/5560817/5560817-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fangjun Huang (M'07) received the B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.","Since 2005, he is with the School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China. from June of 2009 to June of 2010, he was also a postdoctoral researcher in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ.

Some successful approaches have been presented for detecting double JPEG compression when the primary compression and the secondary compression have different quantization matrixes. However, when the primary compression and the secondary compression have the same quantization matrix, no detection method has been reported yet. In this paper, we present a method which can detect double JPEG compression with the same quantization matrix. Our algorithm is based on the observation that in the process of recompressing a JPEG image with the same quantization matrix over and over again, the number of different JPEG coefficients, i.e., the quantized discrete cosine transform coefficients between the sequential two versions will monotonically decrease in general. For example, the number of different JPEG coefficients between the singly and doubly compressed images is generally larger than the number of different JPEG coefficients between the corresponding doubly and triply compressed images. Via a novel random perturbation strategy implemented on the JPEG coefficients of the recompressed test image, we can find a \u201cproper\u201d randomly perturbed ratio. For different images, this universal \u201cproper\u201d ratio will generate a dynamically changed threshold, which can be utilized to discriminate the singly compressed image and doubly compressed image. Furthermore, our method has the potential to detect triple JPEG compression, four times JPEG compression, etc.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","volume":"5","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11641635","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560817/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Double JPEG Compression With the Same Quantization Matrix","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Double JPEG Compression With the Same Quantization Matrix","sourcePdf":"tifs-huang-2072921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068585S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5623286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5623286","articleId":"5560817","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560822,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chin Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Chin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37307619400"},{"name":"Cheng-Chih Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Chih","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37536094000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"5560822","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":351,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6638},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"abstract":"The main objective of developing an image-watermarking technique is to satisfy both imperceptibility and robustness requirements.

A text region detector is designed to estimate the text existing confidence and scale information in image pyramid, which help segment candidate text components by local binarization. To efficiently filter out the non-text components, a conditional random field (CRF) model considering unary component properties and binary contextual component relationships with supervised parameter learning is proposed. Finally, text components are grouped into text lines/words with a learning-based energy minimization method. Since all the three stages are learning-based, there are very few parameters requiring manual tuning.

In detecting a target at known distance and Doppler frequency, no uniformly optimum transmit policy exists, and diversity maximization turns out to be the way to go only in a (still unspecified) large signal-to-noise ratio region. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on the optimum transmit policy as the radar is to detect a target at an unknown location: To this end, at first the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds as a function of the STC matrix are computed, and then waveform design is stated as a constrained optimization problem, where now the constraint concerns also the accuracy in target ranging, encapsulated in the Fisher Information on the range estimate. Results indicate that such accuracy constraints may visibly modify the required transmit policy and lead to rank-deficient STC also in regions where pure detection would require pursuing full transmit diversity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05560845.pdf","startPage":"6195","endPage":"6206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2072923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2072923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-Time Coding for MIMO Radar Detection and Ranging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Encoding","Signal to noise ratio","Delay","Optimization","Accuracy","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","Doppler shift","MIMO radar","optimisation","radar antennas","radar detection","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time coding","MIMO radar detection","spaced antennas","rank-one coding","multiple transmit antennas","power multiplexers","full-rank coding","transmit diversity maximization","rank-deficient coding","Doppler frequency","signal-to-noise ratio region","optimum transmit policy","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds","STC matrix","waveform design","constrained optimization problem","target ranging","fisher information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity-integration tradeoff","MIMO radar","parameter estimation","radar detection","space time codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Coding for MIMO Radar Detection and Ranging","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5560845/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641786","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Coding for MIMO Radar Detection and Ranging","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2072923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072402S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5560845","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560846,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5560846/5560846-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing Zhao (S\u201997\u2013M\u201902\u2013SM\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2001.","In August 2004, she joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California at Davis (UC Davis), where she is currently an Associate Professor.

At each time, only one process can be observed, and the observations are random realizations drawn from two different distributions depending on the current state (ON or OFF) of the chosen process. The objective is to catch an idle period in any of the ON-OFF processes as quickly as possible subject to a reliability constraint. We show that this problem presents a fresh twist to the classic problem of quickest change detection that considers only one stochastic process. A Bayesian formulation of the problem is developed for both infinite and finite number of processes based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). While a general POMDP is PSPACE-hard, we show that the optimal decision rule has a simple threshold structure for the infinite case. For the finite case, basic properties of the optimal decision rule are established, and a low-complexity threshold policy is proposed which converges to the optimal decision rule for the infinite case as the number of processes increases. This problem finds applications in spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks where a secondary user searches for idle channels in the spectrum.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2071869","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05560846.pdf","startPage":"5994","endPage":"6006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2071869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quickest Detection in Multiple On\u2013Off Processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560846/","displayDocTitle":"Quickest Detection in Multiple On\u2013Off Processes","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641789","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560846/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quickest Detection in Multiple On\u2013Off Processes","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhao-2071869-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100487S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5560846","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560848,"authors":[{"name":"Jayakrishnan Radhakrishna Pillai","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/5667077/5560848/5560848-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jayakrishnan Radhakrishna Pillai (S'04) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electrical engineering from Kerala University, India, and National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India, respectively.

As the nature of the wind power is unpredictable, more balancing power is desired for a stable and reliable operation of the power system. The present balancing power in Denmark is provided mostly by the large central power plants followed by a number of decentralized combined heat and power units and connections from abroad. The future energy plans in Denmark aim for 50% wind power capacity integration which will replace many conventional large power plant units. The limited control and regulation power capabilities of large power plants in the future demands for new balancing solutions like vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. In this paper, aggregated electric vehicle (EV)-based battery storage representing a V2G system is modeled for the use in long-term dynamic power system simulations. Further, it is analyzed for power system regulation services for typical days with high and low wind production in the Western Danish power system. The results show that the regulation needs from conventional generators and the power deviations between West Denmark and Union for the Coordination of Electricity Transmission (UCTE) control areas are significantly minimized by the faster up and down regulation characteristics of the EV battery storage.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2010.2072938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/5667077/05560848.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2010.2072938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of Vehicle-to-Grid in the Western Danish Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Integration of Vehicle-to-Grid in the Western Danish Power System","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11693262","htmlLink":"/document/5560848/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of Vehicle-to-Grid in the Western Danish Power System","sourcePdf":"tste-radhakrishnapillai-2072938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059962S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"5667077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"5667077","articleId":"5560848","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560849,"authors":[{"name":"Quansheng Guan","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5613993/5560849/5560849-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Quansheng Guan (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the Nanjing University of Post and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2006.

In this paper, we study topology control and routing issues in CR-MANETs and propose a distributed prediction-based cognitive topology control (PCTC) scheme to provision cognition capability to routing in CR-MANETs. PCTC is a middleware-like cross-layer module residing between CR module and routing. It uses cognitive link availability prediction, which is aware of the interference to primary users and user mobility, to predict the available duration of links. Based on the link prediction, PCTC captures the dynamic changes of the topology and constructs an efficient and reliable topology, which is aimed at mitigating rerouting frequency and improving end-to-end network performance such as throughput and delay. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2069105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","startPage":"4443","endPage":"4452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05560849.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction-Based Topology Control and Routing in Cognitive Radio Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560849/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction-Based Topology Control and Routing in Cognitive Radio Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630057","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction-Based Topology Control and Routing in Cognitive Radio Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-guan-2069105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097188S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5560849","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560857,"authors":[{"name":"Meindert Niemeijer","affiliation":["Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands","University Medical Center Utrecht, Image Sciences Institute, Utrecht, CX, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Meindert","lastName":"Niemeijer","id":"37418440200"},{"name":"Marco Loog","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CN, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Loog","id":"37271823600"},{"name":"Michael David Abr\u00e0moff","affiliation":["Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA","Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael David","lastName":"Abr\u00e0moff","id":"37294650700"},{"name":"Max A.

Most existing reconstruction algorithms for OAT assume that the ultrasound transducers employed to record the measurement data are point-like. When transducers with large detecting areas and/or compact measurement geometries are utilized, this assumption can result in conspicuous image blurring and distortions in the reconstructed images. In this work, a new OAT imaging model that incorporates the spatial and temporal responses of an ultrasound transducer is introduced. A discrete form of the imaging model is implemented and its numerical properties are investigated. We demonstrate that use of the imaging model in an iterative reconstruction method can improve the spatial resolution of the optoacoustic images as compared to those reconstructed assuming point-like ultrasound transducers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","volume":"30","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11804673","pubMedId":"20813634","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560859/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Imaging Model Incorporating Ultrasonic Transducer Properties for Three-Dimensional Optoacoustic Tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Imaging Model Incorporating Ultrasonic Transducer Properties for Three-Dimensional Optoacoustic Tomography","sourcePdf":"tmi-wang-2072514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120224S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5705633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5705633","articleId":"5560859","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5560862,"authors":[{"name":"Sevcan Yilmaz","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Anadolu University, Eskisehir, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5594730/5560862/5560862-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sevcan Yilmaz was born in 1985.

The proposed FWNN models are obtained from the traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system by replacing the THEN part of fuzzy rules with wavelet basis functions that have the ability to localize both in time and frequency domains. The first and last model use summation and multiplication of dilated and translated versions of single-dimensional wavelet basis functions, respectively, and in the second model, THEN parts of the rules consist of radial function of wavelets. Gaussian type of activation functions are used in IF part of the fuzzy rules. A fast gradient-based training algorithm, i.e., the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method, is used to find the optimal values for unknown parameters of the FWNN models. Simulation examples are also given to compare the effectiveness of the models with the other known methods in the literature. According to simulation results, we see that the proposed FWNN models have impressive generalization ability.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2066285","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1609","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5594730/05560862.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2066285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network Models for Prediction and Identification of Dynamical Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Wavelet transforms","Input variables","Fuzzy systems","Computational modeling","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","Gaussian processes","nonlinear control systems","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy wavelet neural network model","dynamical systems prediction","dynamical systems identification","FWNN model","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system","fuzzy rules","wavelet basis functions","wavelet basis functions","Gaussian functions","gradient-based training algorithm","Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy wavelet neural networks","system identification","time-series prediction","wavelet","wavelet neural networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Fuzzy Logic","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Wavelet Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network Models for Prediction and Identification of Dynamical Systems","volume":"21","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5560862/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11561196","pubMedId":"20813638","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network Models for Prediction and Identification of Dynamical Systems","sourcePdf":"tnn-ylmaz-2066285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151831S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5594730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5594730","articleId":"5560862","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":5560863,"authors":[{"name":"Jiali Yu","affiliation":["Agency of Science Technology and Research, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiali","lastName":"Yu","id":"37536571900"},{"name":"Zhang Yi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37267126100"},{"name":"Jiliu Zhou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jiliu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278266400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5560863","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":726},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560863","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Copper","Neurons","Recurrent neural networks","Trajectory","Shape","Artificial neural networks","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous attractors","Lotka-Volterra recurrent neural networks","synaptic connections","continuous stimuli"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous attractors","Lotka\u2013Volterra recurrent neural networks","stable","unstable"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Computer Simulation","Humans","Mathematics","Nerve Net","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2067224","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5594730/05560863.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"1690","endPage":"1695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2067224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Attractors of Lotka\u2013Volterra Recurrent Neural Networks With Infinite Neurons","abstract":"Continuous attractors of Lotka-Volterra recurrent neural networks (LV RNNs) with infinite neurons are studied in this brief.

We developed a prosthesis that partly restores normal function in animals by delivering pulse frequency modulated (PFM) biphasic current pulses via electrodes implanted in semicircular canals. Because the optimal stimulus encoding strategy is not yet known, we investigated effects of varying biphasic current pulse frequency, amplitude, duration, and interphase gap on vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) eye movements in chinchillas. Increasing pulse frequency increased response amplitude while maintaining a relatively constant axis of rotation. Increasing pulse amplitude (range 0-325 \u03bcA) also increased response amplitude but spuriously shifted eye movement axis, probably due to current spread beyond the target nerve. Shorter pulse durations (range 28-340 \u03bcs) required less charge to elicit a given response amplitude and caused less axis shift than longer durations. Varying interphase gap (range 25-175 \u03bcs) had no significant effect. While specific values reported herein depend on microanatomy and electrode location in each case, we conclude that PFM with short duration biphasic pulses should form the foundation for further optimization of stimulus encoding strategies for vestibular prostheses intended to restore sensation of head rotation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560867/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11794019","pubMedId":"20813652","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Biphasic Current Pulse Frequency, Amplitude, Duration, and Interphase Gap on Eye Movement Responses to Prosthetic Electrical Stimulation of the Vestibular Nerve","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Biphasic Current Pulse Frequency, Amplitude, Duration, and Interphase Gap on Eye Movement Responses to Prosthetic Electrical Stimulation of the Vestibular Nerve","sourcePdf":"tnsre-dellasantina-2065241-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112742S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5710486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5710486","articleId":"5560867","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5560869,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Castilla","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00d9, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5675792/5560869/5560869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miguel Castilla received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1988, 1995, and 1998, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been an Associate Professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain, where he teaches courses on analog circuits and power electronics.

A ripple in the injected power and an increase in the current harmonic distortion are the main noticeable adverse effects produced by this abnormal grid situation. Several grid-fault control schemes are nowadays available for operating under unbalanced grid voltage. These control schemes usually have extreme power quality characteristics. Some of them have been conceived to completely avoid power ripple during unbalanced voltage sags, but at an expense of high current harmonic distortion. With other schemes, the harmonic distortion is totally eliminated but at an expense of high ripple in the injected power. This paper further explores the performance of PV inverters under unbalanced voltage sags. It has three theoretical contributions: 1) a generalized control scheme, which includes the aforementioned grid-fault controllers as particular cases; 2) a control strategy based on the use of continuous values for the control parameters. This original approach gives adjustable power quality characteristics that cannot be achieved with the previous control schemes; 3) three different control algorithms for calculating the continuous values of the control parameters. These contributions are experimentally validated with a digital signal processor-based laboratory prototype.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2070081","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5675792/05560869.pdf","startPage":"2930","endPage":"2940","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2070081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5675792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid-Fault Control Scheme for Three-Phase Photovoltaic Inverters With Adjustable Power Quality Characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Grid-Fault Control Scheme for Three-Phase Photovoltaic Inverters With Adjustable Power Quality Characteristics","volume":"25","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11704446","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560869/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-Fault Control Scheme for Three-Phase Photovoltaic Inverters With Adjustable Power Quality Characteristics","sourcePdf":"tpel-castilla-2070081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081557S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5675792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"5675792","articleId":"5560869","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5560870,"authors":[{"name":"Wensong Yu","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5871429/5560870/5560870-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wensong Yu (M\u201907) received the M.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China and the Ph.D. degree from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 1995 and 2000, respectively, both in mechanical and electrical engineering.","In 2000, he was with the Emerson Network Power Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China, where he was involved in the development of digital uninterruptible power supply projects.

These systems are of couplings in every equation of each subsystem, and different subsystems may have different orders. To avoid the noncausal problem in the control design, the system is transformed into a predictor form by rigorous derivation. By exploring the properties of the block triangular form, implicit controls are developed for each subsystem such that the couplings of inputs and states among subsystems have been completely decoupled. The radial basis function NN is employed to approximate the unknown control. Each subsystem achieves a semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded stability with the proposed control, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate its efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Output Feedback NN Control of a Class of Discrete-Time MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Control Directions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2065223","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5730604/05560883.pdf","startPage":"507","endPage":"517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2065223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730604","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Output Feedback NN Control of a Class of Discrete-Time MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Control Directions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5560883/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11862714","pubMedId":"20813646","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Output Feedback NN Control of a Class of Discrete-Time MIMO Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Control Directions","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-ge-2065223-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103562S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5730604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5730604","articleId":"5560883","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5560886,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Trung Dong","affiliation":["Institut Telecom Telecom Bretagne, CNRS Laboratory STICC UMR 3192, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Quang Trung","lastName":"Dong","id":"37528501100"},{"name":"Matthieu Arzel","affiliation":["Institut Telecom Telecom Bretagne, CNRS Laboratory STICC UMR 3192, Technop\u00f4le Brest-Iroise, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Arzel","id":"37276347900"},{"name":"Christophe Jego","affiliation":["CNRS IMS, UMR 5218 351, Cours de la Lib\u00e9ration, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Jego","id":"37271502500"},{"name":"Warren J.

Stochastic decoding of forward error-correction (FEC) codes is inspired by this technique. This paper extends the application of the stochastic decoding approach to the families of convolutional codes and turbo codes. It demonstrates that stochastic computation is a promising solution to improve the data throughput of turbo decoders with very simple implementations. Stochastic fully-parallel turbo decoders are shown to achieve the error correction performance of conventional a posteriori probability (APP) decoders. To our knowledge, this is the first stochastic turbo decoder which decodes a state-of-the-art turbo code. Additionally, an innovative systematic technique is proposed to cope with stochastic additions, responsible for the throughput bottleneck.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05560886.pdf","startPage":"6421","endPage":"6425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2072924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2072924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Decoding of Turbo Codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Measurement","Throughput","AWGN","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","decoding","forward error correction","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic decoding","turbo code","forward error correction codes","convolutional codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative decoding","stochastic decoding","turbo codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Decoding of Turbo Codes","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5560886/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641773","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Decoding of Turbo Codes","sourcePdf":"tsp-arzel-2072924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057156S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5560886","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5560889,"authors":[{"name":"Kapil Gulati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5560889/5560889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kapil Gulati (S'06) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communications engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at The University of Texas at Austin.

In this paper, we consider the problem of statistical-physical modeling of co-channel interference from an annular field of Poisson or Poisson-Poisson cluster distributed interferers. Poisson and Poisson-Poisson cluster processes are commonly used to model interferer distributions in large wireless networks without and with interferer clustering, respectively. Further, by considering the interferers distributed over a parametric annular region, we derive interference statistics for finite- and infinite- area interference region with and without a guard zone around the receiver. Statistical modeling of interference is a useful tool to analyze outage probabilities in wireless networks and design interference-aware transceivers. Our contributions include: 1) developing a unified framework for deriving interference models for various wireless network environments; 2) demonstrating the applicability of the symmetric alpha stable and Gaussian mixture (with Middleton Class A as a particular form) distributions in modeling co-channel interference; and 3) deriving analytical conditions on the system model parameters for which these distributions accurately model the statistical properties of the interference. Applications include co-channel interference modeling for various wireless networks, including wireless ad hoc, cellular, local area, and femtocell networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","volume":"58","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11641788","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560889/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistics of Co-Channel Interference in a Field of Poisson and Poisson-Poisson Clustered Interferers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistics of Co-Channel Interference in a Field of Poisson and Poisson-Poisson Clustered Interferers","sourcePdf":"tsp-gulati-2072922-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13742S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5560889","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5560901,"authors":[{"name":"Maki Arai","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Maki","lastName":"Arai","id":"37538536300"},{"name":"Kei Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37266412100"},{"name":"Kiyomichi Araki","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyomichi","lastName":"Araki","id":"37270249500"},{"name":"Takayuki Sotoyama","affiliation":["Panasonic Mobile Communications Company Limited, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Sotoyama","id":"37398442200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5560901","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"abstract":"In Rayleigh fading environments, a MIMO channel matrix can be considered as a random matrix.

Thus, these models may be implemented in future wireless engineering software package.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05560912.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5560912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5560912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a 3D ray tracing model in urban environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement uncertainty","Predictive models","Loss measurement","Mathematical model","Ray tracing","Diffraction","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D ray tracing model","urban environment","multiple-input multiple-output systems","MIMO","OFDM systems","high data link","radio communication","propagation channel","channel impulse response","ray-launching models","wireless engineering software package"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a 3D ray tracing model in urban environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5560912/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514296","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a 3D ray tracing model in urban environment","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05049S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5560912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5560920,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Mohtashami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Mohtashami","id":"37403679900"},{"name":"Salman Parsa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Parsa","id":"37544670600"},{"name":"Amir Ahmad Shishegar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Ahmad","lastName":"Shishegar","id":"37298373600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5560920","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Receivers","Ray tracing","Computational modeling","Accuracy","Reflection","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient enhancement","ray tracing","accuracy improvement","ray tube","complete cancellation","amplitude error","phase error","reflection coefficient","transmission coefficient"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for improving the accuracy of ray tracing without modeling the source with high resolution.

Due to the reduced number of antennas and the crucial environmental influences (antenna separation, battery, small groundplane), the beamforming performance is limited. Especially in the case of null-steering the achivable attenuation of the nulls is very low. It has been shown, that using parasitic coupled elements, loaded with appropriate impedances, improve the beamforming capabilities. A simplified model of a realistic terminal with two antennas and a single parasitic element has been presented. Using four switchable load impedances at the parasitic element, the null-steering level can be improved in the complete azimuthal range. Improvements of about 14 dB can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5560923","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05560923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5560923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of MIMO-beamforming and null-steering on small, wireless terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5560923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of MIMO-beamforming and null-steering on small, wireless terminals","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5560923/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514372","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5560923/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of MIMO-beamforming and null-steering on small, wireless terminals","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"5023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039956S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5560923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5560924,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Luo","affiliation":["INESC-Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Luo","id":"37403746600"},{"name":"H.

The long distances involved demand the use of high gain antennas and furthermore these applications can benefit from adaptable radiation patterns. The large size of reflectarray antennas ensures their capability to synthesize highly directive beams. To add beam reconngurability to reflectarray antennas, the phase shifting techniques utilized in phased array antennas can be applied, since a reflectarray can be considered as an array of reflecting elements. Electronically-controlled reflectarray elements utilize different technologies such as varactor diodes, MEMS switches and liquid crystal materials to dynamically change the phase of the scattered wave from each element.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Power transmission lines","Arrays","Phase shifters","Directive antennas","Varactors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","reflector antennas","space communication links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable reflectarray antennas","space communication systems","RADAR","point-to-point terrestrial links","high gain antennas","adaptable radiation patterns","highly directive beams","phase shifting techniques","phased array antennas","electronically-controlled reflectarray elements","varactor diodes","MEMS switches","liquid crystal materials","scattered wave phase"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561002","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561002.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An amplifying reconfigurable reflectarray element","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An amplifying reconfigurable reflectarray element","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561002/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561002/","accessionNumber":"11514264","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An amplifying reconfigurable reflectarray element","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"2221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042356S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5561008,"authors":[{"name":"Caner Guclu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Caner","lastName":"Guclu","id":"37545589400"},{"name":"Julien Perruisseau-Carrier","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Perruisseau-Carrier","id":"38276198700"},{"name":"Ozlem Aydin Civi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozlem Aydin","lastName":"Civi","id":"37301230200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561008","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Reflector antennas","Reflection","Arrays","Microstrip","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","beam steering","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microswitches","multifrequency antennas","reflector antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["split-ring element","RF MEMS switches","dual frequency circularly polarized reconfigurable reflectarray cell","reflector-based antenna","phased array antenna","low-cost antenna","high performance antenna array","electronic beam scanning","electronic beam forming","multiband operation","ring strips","RA antenna","beamsteering","RA unit cell geometry","phase design curve"]}],"abstract":"In this study, a dual frequency circularly polarized reconfigurable reflectarray (RA) cell with RF-MEMS switches is designed. RA combines the advantages of reflector-based and phased array antennas, providing a low-cost and high performance antenna array solution. In their reconfigurable implementations, RAs are capable of electronic beam scanning/forming with potential multiband operation, as discussed here. In this work, reconfigurability is achieved by series RF-MEMS switches that are placed on the ring strips. Switches are used to change the orientation of the gaps to realize the rotation of the element.

Furthermore, an important application of FDTD method is that FDTD method can analyze the transient response of the microwave integrate circuits by incorporating the active and passive devices into simulation. However, when the active devices are incorporated into the FDTD cell grids, the updating equations of the grids would become nonlinear due to the nonlinear voltage-current relations of the active devices. To solve these nonlinear equations, an iterative method such as Netwon-Raphson algorithm, need to be employed. This work presents a novel efficient approach for the incorporation of diodes into FDTD method without applying the iterative method.

A wireless charging technique capable of delivering electromagnetic energy to these portable devices would make them tether free and \"truly portable.\" Wireless charging is especially valuable for devices with which wired connections are intractable, e.g., unattended radio frequency identification tags and implanted sensors. In recent years, enormous research efforts have been devoted to wireless charging. In 1990s, a case study is reported to construct a point-to-point wireless electricity transmission to a small isolated village called Grand-Bassin in France. In 2007, an inductive resonance coupling scheme, which makes use of near-field coupling between two magnetic resonators, was demonstrated able to power a 60-Watt light bulb over two meters by a team of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In addition, several companies (PowerCast, WildCharge, WiPower, etc.) have developed products targeting specific applications. Nevertheless, several technical challenges remain to be resolved in order to accomplish practical wireless charging. Specifically, (i) to achieve efficient charging over long distance, severe power loss due to electromagnetic wave propagation must be remedied; (ii) humans' exposure to electromagnetic radiation should always be kept below safety level while sufficient power is delivered to devices; and (iii) some existing systems are unsuitable for ubiquitous deployment due to high cost, large size, and/or heavy weight. In this paper, an innovative wireless charging system based on ultrawideband retro-reflective beamforming is proposed to address the above challenges. The proposed charger consists of multiple antenna elements distributed in space. According to pilot signals (which are short impulses) they receive from the target device, the antenna elements jointly construct a focused electromagnetic beam onto the device (i.e., beamforming). Beamforming enables spatially focused/dedicated power delivery to devices while keeping power level in all the other locations minimal. As a result, the proposed system attains high charging efficiency and leads to little hazard/interference to other objects. Performance of the proposed wireless charging system is demonstrated by some simulation results obtained by a full-wave Maxwell's equations solver.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561113.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical wireless charging system based on ultra-wideband retro-reflective beamforming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561113/","displayDocTitle":"A practical wireless charging system based on ultra-wideband retro-reflective beamforming","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514237","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical wireless charging system based on ultra-wideband retro-reflective beamforming","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"5301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040111S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5561120,"authors":[{"name":"Vinujanan Vairavanathan","affiliation":["Edward S.

FDTD based techniques, despite providing accurate channel characterizations, have often employed point sources in their studies, mainly due to the difficulty in modeling fine geometrical details or features inherent in antennas into a discrete spatial domain. The underlying influences of the antenna on wave propagation and in the case of multiple antenna systems, the issue of mutual coupling between the antenna elements have thus been disregarded. With the growing interest in small antenna-based MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a possible approach for the efficient space-time analysis of such systems in wireless channels. Specifically, a suitable technique for representing antennas in terms of their FDTD-compatible macromodels and their subsequent incorporation into realistic channel models is proposed. This work is an extension which deals with a reciprocity-based approach for macromodeling minimum scattering antennas.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561120","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561120.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient FDTD analysis of antenna-channel interaction via macromodeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561120/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient FDTD analysis of antenna-channel interaction via macromodeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514307","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561120/","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient FDTD analysis of antenna-channel interaction via macromodeling","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057727S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561133,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Such sweeps require repeatedly solving the computational model (FEM or BEM) at various different parameter value combinations, leading to very slow computational design cycles. This paper presents a methodology for performing such sweeps in a fast manner. A multi-parametric model order reduction (MOR) scheme based on the recently developed balanced truncation proper orthogonal decomposition (BT-POD) MOR [1], [2] is introduced to handle such sweeps. In contrast to the previous multi-parameter MOR presented in [3] and [4] that are based on Krylov model reduction, this work adopts the SVD-based reduction paradigm of BT-POD. The multi-parameter space sweep in this work is achieved in a two-step procedure: (1) An off-line (learning) stage where a coarse parameter space POD sampling is used to produce the multi-dimensional balancing transformations, followed by (2) an online (sweep) stage that performs the fine sampled parameter-space sweep via the solution of the reduced model. The system gramians [5] approximation involved in this MOR paradigm is obtained through the use of numerical integration over parameter spaces of interest, therefore such MOR technique can be extended to moderately high-dimensional parameter spaces using specialized Monte-Carlo and sparse grid integration strategies. The POD sampling is straightforwardly parallelizable, leading to farther time savings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-parametric sweep of large-scale FEM models using the BT-POD","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561221","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561221.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-parametric sweep of large-scale FEM models using the BT-POD","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561221/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514356","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-parametric sweep of large-scale FEM models using the BT-POD","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"2073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06134S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5561234,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Ngoly","affiliation":["Computational Analysis and Design Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Ngoly","id":"37541856700"},{"name":"Steve McFee","affiliation":["Computational Analysis and Design Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"McFee","id":"37323362100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561234","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic fields","Wavelet transforms","Frequency domain analysis","Wavelet domain","Transient analysis","Electromagnetic scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic field theory","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet electromagnetic field processing","multidimensional fast wavelet transform decomposition","frequency domain electromagnetic fields","time domain electromagnetic fields"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a wavelet processing method for time and frequency domain electromagnetic fields for the rigorous and efficient inspection of the wave physics properties of transient and time-harmonic electromagnetic field solutions.

This paper applies these expressions to new MIMO measurements in indoor LOS and NLOS environments, indicating how propagation effects limit secure key generation and what key generation rates can be expected in practice.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561245","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561245.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured statistics of reciprocal channel key generation of indoor MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measured statistics of reciprocal channel key generation of indoor MIMO channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561245/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514489","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561245/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured statistics of reciprocal channel key generation of indoor MIMO channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.264918S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5561246,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Cavallo","affiliation":["TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, Netherlands","Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Cavallo","id":"37302429600"},{"name":"Andrea Neto","affiliation":["TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Neto","id":"37277414700"},{"name":"Giampiero Gerini","affiliation":["TNO Defence, Security and Safety, The Hague, Netherlands","Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Giampiero","lastName":"Gerini","id":"37275036400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561246","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Magnetic fields","Dipole antennas","Bandwidth","Broadband antennas","Feeds","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microwave antenna arrays","MMIC","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-scanning connected dipole antenna array","common-mode rejection loops","polarization purity","resonant dipole antenna array","printed circuit board","PCB","MMIC technology","loop-shaped component","X-pol levels","Ansoft HFSS","frequency 10.5 GHz to 14.5 GHz"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10.5\u201314.5 GHz wide-scanning connected array of dipoles with common-mode rejection loops to ensure polarization purity","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561246.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561246","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561246","abstract":"Due to electrical connection between the array elements, standard baluns typically used in arrays of resonant dipoles are not effective for connected arrays.

The channel capacity with the optimal antenna spacing exceeds the Ergodic capacity of the i.i.d. channel since the short range MIMO scheme is very similar to parallel data transmission. The paper focuses on an actual transmission method that is suitable for short range MIMO communications, because a complex transmission scheme such as Eigenmode beamforming (EM-BF) or Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD) is actually required to obtain the ideal channel capacity. When the optimal element spacing is obtained, it clarifies that the channel capacity obtained through Zero Forcing (ZF) at the receiver without beamforming at the transmitter is almost same as that using the EM-BF. The effectiveness of short range MIMO transmission is also clarified using a 4x4 MIMO testbed with actual signals based on the IEEE802.11n standard. The paper shows that the optimal element spacing is a key parameter in short range MIMO communications based on simulation and measurements.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561249","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental evaluation in short range MIMO communication with simple transmission scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental evaluation in short range MIMO communication with simple transmission scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561249/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514514","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental evaluation in short range MIMO communication with simple transmission scheme","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043014S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561251,"authors":[{"name":"Pedram Mousavi","affiliation":["Intelwaves Technologies Limited, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Mousavi","id":"38306809400"},{"name":"Mohammad Fakharzadeh","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Fakharzadeh","id":"38277844900"},{"name":"S.

It is found that the top and bottom placement of antennas within the handset case are the most efficient to be used with up to two antenna elements. There are, however, significant diversity and capacity gain that can be explored by using four distributed antennas even if only two radio chains are available through hybrid selection and combining schemes. It was also found that the practical method of choosing antennas based on signal power for 2 branch MIMO with 4 available handset antennas, performs well compared to the optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561255","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561255.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of user hand and body impact on multiple antenna handset performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of user hand and body impact on multiple antenna handset performance","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561255/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514548","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561255/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of user hand and body impact on multiple antenna handset performance","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043247S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561265,"authors":[{"name":"Sinan Keser","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Sinan","lastName":"Keser","id":"37541946500"},{"name":"Mo Mojahedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Mo","lastName":"Mojahedi","id":"37281116000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561265","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":689},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561265","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shifters","Delay","Arrays","Bandwidth","Linear antenna arrays","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","linear antenna arrays","phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam squint removal","abnormal group delay phase shifters","series-fed linear array antennas","zero group delay","zero phase delay","negative refractive index transmission line","inter-element phase shifter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561265","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561265.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Removal of beam squint in series fed array antennas using abnormal group delay phase shifters","abstract":"In this paper, the concept of beam squint in series-fed linear array antennas is discussed.

Therefore, the need of incorporating this technology into radio network planning and optimization tools rises dramatically for network operators. In this contribution we show results of the validation of advanced ray tracing simulations with channel sounding measurements in the 2.53 GHz frequency band. These measurements were carried out inside the EASY-C project with the objective to learn more about coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission in a real world testbed. We compare simulated and measured eigenvalue characteristics for various MIMO scenarios. As result we can conclude that carefully performed Geometrical Optics based ray-tracing simulations are a suitable prediction model to reflect main characteristics of these scenarios. A further objective of these experiments is to get insight into the physical structure of the radio channel.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561285","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561285.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of MIMO channel measurements in urban areas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561285/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of MIMO channel measurements in urban areas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514171","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561285/","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of MIMO channel measurements in urban areas","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054778S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5561287,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Ogawa","affiliation":["Panasonic Corporation, Kadoma, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37278807900"},{"name":"Toshiteru Hayashi","affiliation":["Panasonic Mobile Communications Company Limited, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiteru","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37533329900"},{"name":"Atsushi Yamamoto","affiliation":["Panasonic Corporation, Kadoma, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Atsushi","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37278495100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561287","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Channel capacity","MIMO","Dipole antennas","Impedance matching","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","dipole antenna arrays","impedance matching","MIMO communication","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L/C-based practical matching","MIMO array","wideband channel capacity","mutual coupling","impedance matching","matching circuit","cellular systems","LTE-advanced system","dipole array"]}],"abstract":"The use of a MIMO array in a small handset often affects system performance due to mutual coupling between the elements. This has motivated many researchers to conduct extensive studies on the effects of mutual coupling, and to optimize the impedance matching conditions to increase the channel capacity. However, there has been little study on enhancing channel capacity using a practical impedance matching circuit that can be used in a MIMO array installed in a commercial handset. In addition, in studying the matching circuit, we must consider the wideband characteristics since the plan for future cellular systems is that they are to be allocated a very wide frequency band, such as the LTE-advanced system. This paper studies the impact of a matching circuit of a dipole array constructed from practical L/Cbased circuit components on channel capacity over a wide frequency band.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561287","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum L/C-based practical matching for the maximum wideband channel capacity of a compact MIMO array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum L/C-based practical matching for the maximum wideband channel capacity of a compact MIMO array","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561287/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514173","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561287/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum L/C-based practical matching for the maximum wideband channel capacity of a compact MIMO array","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043107S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561338,"authors":[{"name":"Rafiza Ruslan","affiliation":["School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Pulau, Penang, Malaysia","Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Science, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Arau, Perlis, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rafiza","lastName":"Ruslan","id":"37542144700"},{"name":"Tat-Chee Wan","affiliation":["School of Computer Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Pulau, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tat-Chee","lastName":"Wan","id":"37274191800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6718-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6715-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6717-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-899X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-8973"},{"format":"CD","value":"2155-897"}],"articleNumber":"5561338","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561338","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Load management","Chromium","Cognitive radio","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Interference","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy control","resource allocation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wi-Fi load balancing","cognitive radio techniques","intelligent load balancing techniques","cell breathing","fuzzy controller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561338","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5523828/5561289/05561338.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5561289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wi-Fi load balancing using cognitive radio techniques","abstract":"The current growth of IEEE 802.11 WLAN brings the need to apply intelligent load balancing techniques in order to optimize the overall network performance.

The most used technique in this field is the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which is a statistical and extremely powerful method. The HMM model parameters are crucial information in HMM ASR process, and directly influence the recognition precision since they can make an excellent description of the speech signal. Therefore optimizing HMM parameters is still an important and challenging work in automatic speech recognition research area. Usually the Baum-Welch (B-W) Algorithm is used to calculate the HMM model parameters. However, the B-W algorithm uses an initial random guess of the parameters, therefore after convergence the output tends to be close to this initial value of the algorithm, which is not necessarily the global optimum of the model parameters. In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with Baum-Welch (GA-BW) is proposed; the idea is to use GA exploration ability to obtain the optimal parameters within the solution space.","doi":"10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561388","pdfPath":"/iel5/5523828/5561380/05561388.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"545","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2010 International Symposium on Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5561380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HMM parameters estimation using hybrid Baum-Welch genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"HMM parameters estimation using hybrid Baum-Welch genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11513828","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561388/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HMM parameters estimation using hybrid Baum-Welch genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ITSO1T22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058415S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5523828","isNumber":"5561380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5523828","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5561380","articleId":"5561388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5561391,"authors":[{"name":"Bassam A.

This kind of array synthesis requires a multi-objective approach since there is no single solution which can be considered the best at the multiple investigated frequencies for all the compulsory requirements. Therefore this class of problems, instead of a single one, is characterized by an ideal set of solutions, the Pareto front (PF), which comprises solutions over which no other solution of the population dominates. This set provides a range of solutions for which no one can simultaneously satisfy the required performance but represents a tradeoff of the design requirements. Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOAs) can be a useful tool for determining the Pareto front. They perform similarly to conventional genetic algorithms but they search for the set of solution which belongs to the PF, rather than providing only a single optimal solution. In particular, we have adopted a multi-objective genetic algorithm, called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize the array factor of a Spiral Array.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561418","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561418.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of wideband spiral arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spirals","Wideband","Microwave antenna arrays","Broadband antennas","Geometry","Frequency synthesizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","genetic algorithms","multifrequency antennas","Pareto optimisation","sorting","spiral antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband spiral antenna arrays","multiobjective optimization approach","array design","antenna radiation pattern","side lobe level","array synthesis","Pareto front","multiobjective genetic algorithms","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of wideband spiral arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561418/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514398","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of wideband spiral arrays","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"2102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074258S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561421,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper presents a comparison between feed-forward back-propagation and radial basis ANN base on their performance. The comparison is performed using a Monte Carlo study that involves the following problems: addition, multiplication, division, powers and a production function.

Due to the increasing need for flexible and lightweight electronic systems, FDC aims to develop materials and structural platforms that allow flexible backplane electronics to be integrated with display components that are economical for mass-production [2]. Currently, FDC is focusing on the incorporation of antenna structures, which can function cooperatively with the other flexible circuit elements. Design of flexible antennas, as a part of flexible electronic circuits, may have a very wide spectrum of applications in military and civilian wireless communication, which can allow people to wear antenna structures instead of carry them. Hence, flexible and fluidic antennas have a great potential [3]. In this paper, the design, fabrication, simulation and measurements of a bow-tie antenna with a flexible substrate is discussed. The antenna is modeled and simulated with Ansoft HFSS, and the simulations are compared with measurements performed in the Electromagnetic Anechoic Chamber (EMAC) at ASU.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561673","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible bow-tie antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561673/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible bow-tie antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514213","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561673/","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible bow-tie antennas","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075953S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5561700,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The most popular approach to introduce such a band-notched function is to embed slots or slit into the radiator or its ground plane. A. 5.2 GHz band-notched UWB antenna using a slot-type split ring resonator (SRR) has been proposed. In this paper, a novel way is proposed to design a triband-notched UWB antenna by utilizing capacitively-loaded loops (CLLs). Each CLL element has a high-Q characteristic, in addition to its compact size, making them very suitable for band-stop filter functions. Like the SRR element, the CLL element is self-resonant, the resonant frequency being determined mainly by the loop inductance and the capacitance resulting from cuts in the loop. However, the CLL element has a much simpler design. Different CLLs are placed on both sides of the feeding line to control the band-notched frequencies, as well as to minimize their space requirements. By tuning the sizes of the CLL elements, tri-band-notched functionality can be easily obtained.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561713.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561713","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561713","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561713","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband antennas","Finite element methods","Resonant frequency","FCC","Antenna radiation patterns","Electromagnetic interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-stop filters","resonators","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triband notched ultra-wideband antenna","capacitively loaded loops","band-notched UWB antenna","band-notched function","ground plane","slot-type split ring resonator","high-Q characteristic","band-stop filter functions","resonant frequency","loop inductance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561713/","displayDocTitle":"Tri-band notched ultra-wideband antenna using capacitively loaded loops (CLLs)","accessionNumber":"11514466","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561713/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tri-band notched ultra-wideband antenna using capacitively loaded loops (CLLs)","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037301S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561718,"authors":[{"name":"Colin Sheldon","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University-Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Sheldon","id":"37393357300"},{"name":"Munkyo Seo","affiliation":["University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA","Teledyne Scientific and Imaging Limited Liability Company, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Munkyo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37418869300"},{"name":"Eric Torkildson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Torkildson","id":"37393356100"},{"name":"Upamanyu Madhow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Upamanyu","lastName":"Madhow","id":"37274246600"},{"name":"Mark Rodwell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Rodwell","id":"37270330900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561718","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Bit error rate","Receivers","Multiplexing","Prototypes","Baseband","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","demodulation","millimetre waves","radio links","space division multiplexing","spatiotemporal phenomena","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive spatial multiplexing","scalable system architecture","millimeter-wave line-of-sight communication link","spatial channel","demodulation","system bandwidth","spatiotemporal channel","spatially multiplexed channel","broadband adaptive analog vector signal processing","bit rate 2.4 Gbit/s","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A scalable system architecture is proposed and demonstrated for spatial multiplexing over millimeter-wave line-of-sight communication links.

The spatially multiplexed channels are separated at the receiver using broadband adaptive analog I/Q vector signal processing. A control loop continuously tunes the channel separation electronics to correct for changes with time in either the propagation environment or the system components.

Unlike the former designs, the switchable polarizations in slot can be excited by a single CPW structure. Compact feed is realized by switching the two orthogonal modes in CPW. The antenna is simulated to validate the structure. Obtained results show bandwidths of two switchable polarizations are 630 MHz (26.3%) and 590 MHz (24.6%) with return loss better than -10 dB. The simulated gain is better than 4.03 dBi and 2.12 dBi for both polarizations in the WLAN band of 2.4-2.484 GHz. Considering the simulation is made in ideal situation, without the insertion loss introduced by PIN diodes and their bias circuit. In the future research, the antenna will be fabricated and tuned for better performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561799.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization reconfigurable slot antenna for WLAN application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","Coplanar waveguides","Switches","PIN photodiodes","Broadband antennas","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","coplanar waveguides","slot antennas","UHF antennas","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization reconfigurable slot antenna","WLAN","wideband antenna","compact slot antenna","single CPW structure","compact feed","orthogonal modes","PIN diodes","bias circuit","insertion loss","bandwidth 630 MHz","bandwidth 590 MHz","frequency 2.4 GHz to 2.484 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Polarization reconfigurable slot antenna for WLAN application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514668","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization reconfigurable slot antenna for WLAN application","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"3299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087556S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561806,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This matrix is based on UWB CPW directional coupler and UWB transitions. In fact, the CPW technology has been adopted due to several attractive features: mainly, absence of costly and inductive via holes, ease of making shunt and series connections, ease of controlling the characteristics of CPW lines by changing the slot and strip widths, and ability to use at mm-waves applications. It is advantageously used to offer a very wide bandwidth and to avoid using any crossing lines.

Wideband agile beamforming networks remain a major challenge and are a topic of intense research. State-of-the-art beamforming hardware generally consists of variable delay elements in a delay-and-sum architecture where signals are summed coherently after experiencing a variable true-time-delay (TTD) component. This paper explores a method of achieving UWB beamforming based on multidimensional filtering using sampled signals from a linear antenna array. This beamformer is experimentally characterized in a real UWB radio channel using two techniques.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561822.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental verification of an adaptive UWB beamformer based on multidimensional filtering in a real radio channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561822/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental verification of an adaptive UWB beamformer based on multidimensional filtering in a real radio channel","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514794","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental verification of an adaptive UWB beamformer based on multidimensional filtering in a real radio channel","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"2303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044775S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5561829,"authors":[{"name":"Damir Malnar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Damir","lastName":"Malnar","id":"38479548300"},{"name":"Miroslav Joler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Joler","id":"37267590000"},{"name":"Christos G.

Two usage scenarios are investigated, data and voice. The antennas and the user are electromagnetically simulated and are then integrated into the statistical 3GPP spatial channel model. There, the channel statistics are analyzed through the average channel capacity, correlation, and the channel power transfer. It was found that the presence of the user contributed to a loss up to 50% in the channel power. The data position was found to be the lowest in terms of channel capacity. The user orientation caused the most variability in the performance for the voice position, while it had negligible impact on performance in the data

This novel approach can be employed in all variety of CBFEM techniques in a similar manner. In the multi-level scheme, the CBFs in each level are progressively combined by grouping a number of sub-domains into larger sub-domains belonging to the higher levels. That is, the CBFs of an arbitrary higher level are determined by employing those of the preceding level. This nested procedure repeatedly utilizes the small-scale CBFEM within a relatively-largescale CBFEM. In this way, a considerable reduction is achieved in memory requirements, especially in large-scale problems. Below the authors first presents a description of the algorithm, and then follow it up with some representative examples to demonstrate the performance of the method in 3D electromagnetic scattering problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solution of large scattering problems using a multilevel scheme in the context of Characteristic Basis Finite Element Method","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561875","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561875.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Solution of large scattering problems using a multilevel scheme in the context of Characteristic Basis Finite Element Method","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561875/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515091","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solution of large scattering problems using a multilevel scheme in the context of Characteristic Basis Finite Element Method","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"IF2163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048626S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5561882,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Especially deployment of the band at 700 MHz is challenging due to miniaturized size of terminal devices. Effective MIMO system requires multiple antennas receiving uncorrelated signal. In case of small handset devices in which the antennas are unavoidably closely spaced at least in frequencies lower than 1 GHz, the antenna radiation patterns should be dissimilar in order to reach low correlation between the signals received by separate antenna branches. A novel active antenna solution and a compact passive antenna both applicable in small handsets covering LTE bands 12, 13, 14 and 17 (698-798 MHz) as well as band 7 (2500-2690 MHz), GSM850 (824-894 MHz), EGSM900 (880-960 MHz), PCN (1710-1880 MHz), PCS (1850-1990 MHz) and UMTS (1920-2170 MHz) are presented in this paper. Different MIMO configurations are constructed of these antenna designs. It has been shown that it is possible to reach low correlation between two closely spaced, effective handset antennas even at 700 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561905","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561905.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low correlation handset antenna configuration for LTE MIMO applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561905/","displayDocTitle":"Low correlation handset antenna configuration for LTE MIMO applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514742","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561905/","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low correlation handset antenna configuration for LTE MIMO applications","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"IF3159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035901S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5561916,"authors":[{"name":"Jiefu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jiefu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539207400"},{"name":"Qing H.

Work by Hill, Farle, et. al has explored nonconformal unstructured meshes to aid in the application of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and geometric multigrid methods on tetrahedral meshes. Demkowicz, Kurtz, et. al have worked with nonconformal hexahedral meshes. This work proposes an octree mesh based FEM which enjoys fast, robust meshing, as well as simplified matrix assembly. There is the potential to reap large benefits when applied to AMR and multigrid methods, since the overhead of local refinements on unstructured meshes is avoided, and projections between differing levels of mesh refinement are simplified. The stair-casing prevalent in structured meshes, while still present, is mitigated by the nonconformal nature of the octree mesh.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561918","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561918.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Octree-based Finite Element Method for electromagnetic scattering problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561918/","displayDocTitle":"Octree-based Finite Element Method for electromagnetic scattering problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11514801","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5561918/","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Octree-based Finite Element Method for electromagnetic scattering problems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"IF2151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053127S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5561924,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Feng Xue","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ming-Feng","lastName":"Xue","id":"37397333300"},{"name":"Yu-Jia Li","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yu-Jia","lastName":"Li","id":"37538203000"},{"name":"Jian-Ming Jin","affiliation":["Center for Computational Electromagnetics, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian-Ming","lastName":"Jin","id":"37280854000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561924","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Bismuth","Integral equations","Mathematical model","Electromagnetics","Arrays","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM computation","FETI-DP algorithm","BI hybrid algorithm","FETI-DP-BI","antenna array radiation","scattering problems","electromagnetic simulation","dual- primal finite element tearing and interconnecting and boundary integral","Lagrange multipliers","Robin boundary condition","Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new hybrid algorithm, which is referred to as FETI-DP-BI, to solve antenna array radiation and scattering problems in electromagnetic simulation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we present the framework of VGFEM with tetrahedral elements, and then explain the hybrid FEM-VGFEM technique.

Numerical applications are performed to confirm the efficiency of both approaches.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5561974","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05561974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5561974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow and shaped beam synthesis of arbitrary arrays via linear programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Narrow and shaped beam synthesis of arbitrary arrays via linear programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5561974/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515130","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5561974/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow and shaped beam synthesis of arbitrary arrays via linear programming","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"3077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057379S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5561974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5561992,"authors":[{"name":"Siyang Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siyang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37536890400"},{"name":"Yinghua LV","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinghua","lastName":"LV","id":"38235817500"},{"name":"Jinling Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37966661700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4967-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4968-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"CD","value":"1522-3965"}],"articleNumber":"5561992","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5561992","abstract":"A novel broadband microstrip antenna with 50% bandwidth is proposed in this paper.

For thin wire formalism, one cumulates small section with a problem of conforming to the Yee's cell and fast variation of both looping magnetic field and radial electric field close to the wire. Among all previous thin wire published models, only Holland's approach has evolved toward inclined wires. Hence the works of Ledfelt and Edelvik show that it is possible to have a wire's behaviour independent of its location in the Yee's cell or its obliquity. Our new approach compared to is justified by the necessity to deal with a junction between several oblique wires. Indeed is not extended for multiwire junction because the coupling between the wire current and the electrical field uses a cylinder-shaped stencil with a section superior to the FDTD cell size and so it is too difficult to suit correctly to a junction with more than two wires. To avoid this problem, we propose a technique where the coupling between the wire and the FDTD meshing is limited to only the cells that contain a part of the wire.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010

In this paper an OFDM system will be presented that offers communication and radar functions in parallel based on one joint transmit signal. A typical application area would be intelligent transportation systems, which require the ability for vehicle-to-vehicle communication as well as the need for reliable environment sensing. A system demonstrator based on commercial equipment has been set up that allows for the transmission of an OFDM signal carrying arbitrary user information. From the reflected signal radar images resolving the distances of multiple reflecting objects can be calculated.

The error involved in the prediction is less than 6.5 dB. This error is less than the deviation observed during measurement. The sensitivity study clearly shows parameters which affect the model efficiency values. Also, the electromagnetic parameters (\u03b5\u0393 , \u03c3) in the studied gallery are definitively proposed and hardly affects the model output. Their restricted influence on the model depends on the contribution of the number of reflected rays that have reached the receiving antenna. Antenna localization, in the model, must be done carefully by taking in to account the gallery geometry configuration. This work also presents calibration system for non linear or complex data analysis. A genetic algorithm has been used here to achieve the calibration goals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548930/5560891/05562316.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2010.5562316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2010.5562316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5560891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5562316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-tracing model calibration for underground mines propagation prediction at high UHF frequencies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Receiving antennas","Predictive models","Transmitting antennas","Calibration","Analytical models","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","genetic algorithms","geometry","mining","ray tracing","receiving antennas","UHF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray-tracing model calibration","underground mines propagation prediction","high UHF frequencies","model efficiency","electromagnetic parameters","antenna localization","complex data analysis","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Ray-tracing model calibration for underground mines propagation prediction at high UHF frequencies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5562316/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11515054","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"11-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-tracing model calibration for underground mines propagation prediction at high UHF frequencies","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"IF4169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07837S","chronDate":"11-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548930","isNumber":"5560891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548930","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5560891","articleId":"5562316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5562322,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Woong Woo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae Woong","lastName":"Woo","id":"38253050500"},{"name":"Jae Hee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Hee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539874400"},{"name":"Jeong Keun Ji","affiliation":["E.M.W.

Increasing switching frequencies enable shrinking the size of magnetics and realizing integrating magnetics on-chip, but controlling losses of the magnetics at high frequencies is challenging.

Fundamental limits on utilization of reactive elements developed in the literature for all DC-DC converters are also reviewed and discussed, and this analysis shows that popular SC and inductor-based converters achieve the limits of utilization for reactive components. These limits are stated in terms of the ratio of output power to required stored energy in reactive elements. A detailed analysis of available surface mount discrete components and on-die devices reveals that capacitors have substantially higher energy and power density than their magnetic counterparts. The challenging regulation task for SC converters is also discussed, with a promising strategy outlined. The SC converter is evidently a promising candidate for future high power density integrated DC-DC converters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative analysis of Switched-Capacitor and inductor-based DC-DC conversion technologies","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2010.5562407","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550963/5562352/05562407.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2010.5562407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5562407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A comparative analysis of Switched-Capacitor and inductor-based DC-DC conversion technologies","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5562407/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11515275","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative analysis of Switched-Capacitor and inductor-based DC-DC conversion technologies","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"T203Seeman.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056937S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550963","isNumber":"5562352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550963","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5562352","articleId":"5562407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5562416,"authors":[{"name":"Naveed Hingora","affiliation":["National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission, NCREPT, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Naveed","lastName":"Hingora","id":"38557974800"},{"name":"Xiangyu Liu","affiliation":["National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission, NCREPT, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"38559712100"},{"name":"Brice McPherson","affiliation":["National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission, NCREPT, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Brice","lastName":"McPherson","id":"37301358600"},{"name":"Yongfeng Feng","affiliation":["National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission, NCREPT, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA"],"firstName":"Yongfeng","lastName":"Feng","id":"38558527000"},{"name":"H.

The circuit employs a soft-saturation core inductor in order to reduce size as well as to control Q factor. Phase control is used in the resonant mode to track the changing inductor value. Ignition detection is performed by monitoring the actual phase, and comparing it to the previous phase. A dramatic shift indicates a change in the lamp impedance, corresponding to lamp ignition. Current is controlled in order to stabilize the arc, and allows for manipulation of the current envelope during warm-up. During steady-state, an outer power loop controls overall lamp power. This ignition and startup differs from previous work in that the warm-up is conducted in the low-frequency square-wave mode, requiring a larger stable operating load resistance range, as lamp resistance varies during warm-up. Fast low-frequency square-wave transitions are obtained by use of a time-optimal control. Experimental tests demonstrate successful acoustic resonance free lamp operation of a 150 W high pressure sodium lamp.","doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2010.5562439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2010.5562439","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550963/5562352/05562439.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 12th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HID lamp driver with phase controlled resonant-mode ignition detection and fast transition to LFSW warm-up mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"HID lamp driver with phase controlled resonant-mode ignition detection and fast transition to LFSW warm-up mode","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5562439/","accessionNumber":"11515220","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562439/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HID lamp driver with phase controlled resonant-mode ignition detection and fast transition to LFSW warm-up mode","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"P202Schnell.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055052S","chronDate":"28-30 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550963","isNumber":"5562352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550963","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5562352","articleId":"5562439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5562442,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The NARX model was trained with noisy recorded signal as inputs, and clean signal (from the MP3 audio file) as the output. The system identification process then tries to relate between the input and the output so that the noise component from the input is removed in the output stage. The binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) algorithm was used to perform model structure selection (selection of input and output lagged signals that best explains the future values of the data). Parameter estimation of the NARX model was done using Householder Transform-based QR factorization. Fitting and residual tests results show that the NARX model was successful in estimating the model, and filtering out noise well.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autoregressive processes","Adaptation model","Training","Adaptive filters","System identification","Testing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","audio signal processing","autoregressive processes","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filter","nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous","NARX model","recorded audio noise removal","MP3 audio file","binary particle swarm optimization","model structure selection","parameter estimation","householder transform-based QR factorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System identification","Non-linear Auto-Regressive Model with Exogenous Inputs (NARX)","Adaptive Filter","noise cancellation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSGRC.2010.5562528","startPage":"26","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557900/5562516/05562528.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICSGRC.2010.5562528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive filter based on NARX model for recorded audio noise removal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive filter based on NARX model for recorded audio noise removal","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11513917","publicationDate":"June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-22 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5562528/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-22 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive filter based on NARX model for recorded audio noise removal","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081026S","chronDate":"22-22 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557900","isNumber":"5562516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557900","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5562516","articleId":"5562528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5562544,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Approaches based on activity analysis provide intriguing possibilities for region-of-interest (ROI) processing since relevant activities and their locations are detected prior to higher-level processing such as object tracking, tagging, and classification. This strategy is essential for scalability of video analysis to cluttered environments with a multitude of objects and activities. Activity analysis approaches typically do not involve object tracking, and yet they inherently account for spatiotemporal dependencies. They are robust to clutter arising from multiple activities and contamination arising from poor background subtraction or occlusions. They can sometimes also be employed for fusing activities from multiple cameras. We illustrate successful application of activity analysis to anomaly detection in various scenarios, including the detection of abandoned objects, crowds of people, and illegal U-turns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5562641/05562666.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2010.937393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.937393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562641","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5562666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Anomaly Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Tracking","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Unsupervised learning","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contamination","statistical analysis","video cameras","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video anomaly identification","statistical approach","video anomaly detection","unsupervised approaches","statistical activity analysis","region-of-interest processing","higher-level processing","spatiotemporal dependencies","contamination","video camera networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Video Anomaly Identification","volume":"27","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5562666/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11512728","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Anomaly Identification","sourcePdf":"27msp05-saligrama.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200937S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5562641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5562641","articleId":"5562666","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5562728,"authors":[{"name":"Hiram Galeana-Zapien","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5562728/5562728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiram Galeana-Zapi\u00e9n received the Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering degree from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n Monte-rrey, M\u00e9xico in June 2001.

However, as enhanced air interfaces have been deployed, and mobile data and multimedia traffic increases, a growing concern is that the backhaul of the cellular network can become the bottleneck in certain deployment scenarios. In this paper, we extend the BS assignment problem to cope with possible backhaul congestion situations. A backhaul-aware BS assignment problem is modeled as an optimization problem using a utility-based framework, imposing constraints on both radio and backhaul resources, and mapped into a Multiple-Choice Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MMKP). A novel heuristic BS assignment algorithm with polynomial time is formulated, evaluated and compared to classical schemes based exclusively on radio conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can provide the same system capacity with less backhaul resources so that, under backhaul bottleneck situations, a better overall network performance is effectively achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05562728.pdf","startPage":"3226","endPage":"3237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.082110.091735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.082110.091735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5562728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Evaluation of a Backhaul-Aware Base Station Assignment Algorithm for OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Mobile communication","Optimization","Mobile computing","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","communication complexity","knapsack problems","mobile radio","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backhaul-aware base station assignment algorithm","OFDMA-based cellular networks","radio criteria","air interface","mobile data","multimedia traffic","backhaul congestion","optimization problem","utility-based framework","multiple-choice multidimensional knapsack problem","heuristic base station assignment algorithm","polynomial time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BS assignment algorithms","mobile backhaul","OFDMA","radio resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and Evaluation of a Backhaul-Aware Base Station Assignment Algorithm for OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","volume":"9","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5562728/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574411","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Evaluation of a Backhaul-Aware Base Station Assignment Algorithm for OFDMA-Based Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"3226-tw1010-zapien.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125432S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5562728","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5562729,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5562729/5562729-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Cheng (S'09) received the B.Eng.

Since perfect channel knowledge is difficult to obtain in practice, limited feedback is a widely accepted solution. The dynamic number of cooperating BSs and heterogeneous path loss effects of network MIMO systems pose new challenges on limited feedback design. In this paper, we propose a scalable limited feedback design for network MIMO systems with multiple base stations, multiple users and multiple data streams for each user. We propose a limited feedback framework using per-cell product codebooks, along with a low-complexity feedback indices selection algorithm. We show that the proposed per-cell product codebook limited feedback design can asymptotically achieve the same performance as the joint-cell codebook approach. We also derive an asymptotic per-user throughput loss due to limited feedback with per-cell product codebooks.

To our best knowledge, it is the first time that real-time spectrum sensing on hardware platform with controllable primary user devices is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562734/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2010","volume":"14","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"11560968","publicationDate":"October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5562734/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of Real-Time Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of Real-Time Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"915-cl1010-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040545S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5593934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5593934","articleId":"5562734","onlineDate":"02 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5562777,"authors":[{"name":"James A.

Other approaches use surrogates for direct ties including copresense, cooccurrence, or structural equivalence. In contrast, this paper focuses on semantic equivalence among social actors, regardless of their direct contact. In particular, to index semantic similarity, it measures the entire semantic network across the body of messages an individual produces and compares that network to another person's to index how similar they are. Then it uses this similarity coefficient as the social network tie for network analysis to identify communities of semantic practice. Semantic similarity has some unique value for theory and practice in automated social network analysis. To illustrate this approach, this research extracted all 10, 001 posts from a public discussion forum authored by 3, 272 individuals and represented each author's semantic network based on cooccurrences of all word pairs within three word positions. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for 5.36 million pairs of individuals using Quadratic Assignment Procedures (QAP). Authors sharing approximately 50% of their semantic networks numbered 22. Subsequent network analysis found that they constituted a single group in terms of a community of linguistic practice. A different forum was analyzed as a contrast. Applications of such a procedure can test hypotheses about semantic network similarity in relation to variations in communication frequency and modality More practical purposes would include finding persons of interest to add to a watch list.","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562738/5562740/05562777.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"151","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2010.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2010.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying Networks of Semantically-Similar Individuals from Public Discussion Forums","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Networks of Semantically-Similar Individuals from Public Discussion Forums","htmlLink":"/document/5562777/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11517061","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Networks of Semantically-Similar Individuals from Public Discussion Forums","confLoc":"Odense, Denmark","sourcePdf":"4138a144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047486S","chronDate":"9-11 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562738","isNumber":"5562740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562738","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5562740","articleId":"5562777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5562884,"authors":[{"name":"Tiezhu Zhao","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Computer Network, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tiezhu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537915000"},{"name":"Verdi March","affiliation":["Asia-Pacific Science and Technology Center (APSTC), Sun MicroSystems, Inc., Singapore","Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Verdi","lastName":"March","id":"37540942300"},{"name":"Shoubin Dong","affiliation":["Guangdong Key Laboratory of Computer Network, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shoubin","lastName":"Dong","id":"37306779000"},{"name":"Simon See","affiliation":["Asia-Pacific Science and Technology Center (APSTC), Sun MicroSystems, Inc., Singapore","Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"See","id":"37270956100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7544-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7543-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-131X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-1328"}],"articleNumber":"5562884","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":631},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5562884","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Performance evaluation","Predictive models","Correlation","Bandwidth","Sun","Synthetic aperture sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file organisation","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lustre file system performance model","large-scale global parallel file system","high performance computing","HPC system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["performance evaluaion","parallel file system","model","lustre"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ChinaGrid.2010.38","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth Annual ChinaGrid Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth Annual ChinaGrid Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562735/5562862/05562884.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaGrid.2010.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of a Performance Model of Lustre File System","abstract":"As a large-scale global parallel file system, Lustre file system plays a key role in High Performance Computing (HPC) system, and the potential performance of such systems can be difficult to predict because the potential impact to application performance is not clearly understood. It is important to gain insights into the deliverable Lustre file system IO efficiency. In order to gain a good understanding on what and how to impact the performance of Lustre file system. This paper presents a study on performance evaluation of Lustre file systems and we propose a novel relative performance model to predict overhead under different performance factors. In our previous experiments, we discover that different performance factors have a closed correlation. In order to mining the correlations, we introduce relative performance model to predict performance differences between a pair of Lustre file system equipped with different performance factors. On average, relative model can predict bandwidth within 17%-28%. The results show our relative prediction model can obtain better prediction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5562884/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11521290","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of a Performance Model of Lustre File System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of a Performance Model of Lustre File System","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"4106a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087021S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562735","isNumber":"5562862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562735","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5562862","articleId":"5562884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5562907,"authors":[{"name":"Balasubramanya Bhat","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Balasubramanya","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37529930100"},{"name":"Frank Mueller","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Mueller","id":"37268072900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7545-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7546-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5998"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1068-3070"}],"articleNumber":"5562907","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":426},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Hardware","Real time systems","Software","SDRAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","hardware-software codesign","program diagnostics","scheduling","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM refresh predictable","embedded control systems","schedulability theory","worst-case execution times","static timing analysis","pipelining","caching","task execution times"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-Time Systems","DRAM","Worst-Case Execution Time","Timing Analysis","DRAM Refresh","Timing Predictability"]}],"abstract":"Embedded control systems with hard real-time constraints require that deadlines are met at all times or the system may malfunction with potentially catastrophic consequences. Schedulability theory can assure deadlines for a given task set when periods and worst-case execution times (WCETs) of tasks are known. While periods are generally derived from the problem specification, a task's code needs to be statically analyzed to derive safe and tight bounds on its WCET. Such static timing analysis abstracts from program input and considers loop bounds and architectural features, such as pipelining and caching. However, unpredictability due to dynamic memory (DRAM) refresh cannot be accounted for by such analysis, which limits its applicability to systems with static memory (SRAM). In this paper, we assess the impact of DRAM refresh on task execution times and demonstrate how predictability is adversely affected leading to unsafe hard real-time system design. We subsequently contribute a novel and effective approach to overcome this problem through software-initiated DRAM refresh. We develop (1) a pure software and(2) a hybrid hardware/software refresh scheme. Both schemes provide predictable timings and fully replace the classical hardware auto-refresh. We discuss implementation details based on this design for multiple concrete embedded platforms and experimentally assess the benefits of different schemes on these platforms. The resulting predictable execution behavior in the presence of DRAM refresh combined with the additional benefit of reduced access delays is unprecedented, to the best of our knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/ECRTS.2010.23","publicationTitle":"2010 22nd Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 22nd Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562647/5562824/05562907.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECRTS.2010.23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Making DRAM Refresh Predictable","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5562907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Making DRAM Refresh Predictable","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5562907/","publicationDate":"July 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11521257","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5562907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making DRAM Refresh Predictable","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"4111a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091134S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562647","isNumber":"5562824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562647","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5562824","articleId":"5562907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5563098,"authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Duda","affiliation":["Department of Measurement and Instrumentation, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"bio":{"p":["Krzysztof Duda (kduda@agh.edu.pl) is an assistant professor in the Department of Measurement and Instrumentation at the AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland."]},"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Duda","id":"37295607200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-5888"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0792"}],"articleNumber":"5563098","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2524},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This article presented a novel method of computing the SDFT that we call the modulated SDFT (mSDFT).

The double LDPC code can be decoded as a single bipartite graph using standard belief propagation (BP) and its limiting performance is analyzed by using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart approximations.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2010.938080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.938080","startPage":"104","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5563096/05563107.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source and Channel Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source and Channel Coding","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588729","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5563107/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source and Channel Coding","sourcePdf":"27msp06-fresia.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111206S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5563096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5563096","articleId":"5563107","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5563110,"authors":[{"name":"Emily B.

This framework requires one to make fewer assumptions about the underlying dynamics, and thereby allows the data to drive the complexity of the inferred model. We began by examining a Bayesian nonparametric HMM, the sticky HDPHMM, that uses a hierarchical DP prior to regularize an unbounded mode space. We then considered extensions to Markov switching processes with richer, conditionally linear dynamics, including the HDP-AR-HMM and HDP-SLDS. We concluded by considering methods for transferring knowledge among multiple related time series. We argued that a featural representation is more appropriate than a rigid global clustering, as it encourages sharing of behaviors among objects while still allowing sequence-specific variability. In this context, the beta process provides an appealing alternative to the DP.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2010","volume":"27","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"11588731","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563110/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Nonparametric Methods for Learning Markov Switching Processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Nonparametric Methods for Learning Markov Switching Processes","sourcePdf":"27msp06-fox.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083757S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5563096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5563096","articleId":"5563110","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5563114,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Bilmes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jeff Bilmes (bilmes@ee.washington.edu) is an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle, and is an adjunct professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Linguistics.

One such application is discussed to provide real time stability controls. The new approach utilizes a substation based dynamic state estimation. The substation based dynamic state estimation uses data from relays, PMUs, meters, FDRs etc in the substation only thus avoiding all issues associated with transmission of data and associated time latencies. The substation based dynamic state estimator provides accurate representation of the dynamic state of the system. The dynamic state estimator runs at rates comparable to the suggested rates in the synchrophasors standard C37.118. Presently it has been implemented to execute 10 times per second thus providing the dynamic state of the substation 10 times per second. The results of the substation based dynamic state estimator are transmitted to a central location for monitoring the dynamic state of the system. A major advantage is the fact that only the dynamic state of the substation is transmitted instead of the raw PMU data that typical wide area monitoring implementations use. Note that the data describing the dynamic state is much less that the raw data of the PMUs. This fact facilitates the speedier transmission of the data in addition to the advantage of a more accurate dynamic state as opposed to the raw data. This infrastructure can be used for a number of applications. The paper focuses on transient stability monitoring, identification of out of step conditions and control. We propose an approach that is based on accurate evaluation of the system energy function (Lyapunov indirect method) and extraction of stability properties from the energy function. Specifically, we provide a methodology for determining the required data accuracy for the reliable real time estimation of the energy function. When the data meet these requirements, the estimated energy function can be visualized and animated providing a powerful visual tool for observing the transient stability or instability of the system. The infrastructure of the substation based dynamic state estimator provides the required accuracy and the ability to predict instabilities before they occur.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563253/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11520914","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563253/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wide area dynamic monitoring and stability controls","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide area dynamic monitoring and stability controls","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IREP2010107CD.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053233S","chronDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559272","isNumber":"5563238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559272","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5563238","articleId":"5563253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5563254,"authors":[{"name":"Dustin F.

Various technical hurdles are involved in the grid interconnection of dish-Stirling systems, particularly with issues related to power factor correction, low voltage ride-through capability, and reactive power planning. While there are no grid-interconnection requirements specific to dish-Stirling technology, the requirements currently established for wind farms are used as a starting point due to the similar design and operating characteristics between wind farms and dish-Stirling solar farms. A dish-Stirling solar farm requires external reactive power compensation to meet the power factor requirements presently set for wind farms. The following paper provides a brief overview of dish-Stirling technology, along with an analysis of methods for meeting power factor grid interconnection requirements and maintaining necessary voltage levels under varying irradiance conditions due to cloud cover. Simulation results for voltage and power factor of the solar farm are provided for both steady state and cloud transient conditions within a 12-bus network.","doi":"10.1109/IREP.2010.5563254","publicationTitle":"2010 IREP Symposium Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - VIII (IREP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IREP Symposium Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - VIII (IREP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559272/5563238/05563254.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IREP.2010.5563254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of variable solar irradiance on the reactive power compensation for large solar farm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563254/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of variable solar irradiance on the reactive power compensation for large solar farm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11520916","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563254/","conferenceDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of variable solar irradiance on the reactive power compensation for large solar farm","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IREP2010108CD.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061231S","chronDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559272","isNumber":"5563238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559272","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5563238","articleId":"5563254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5563275,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Paulo A.

The main objective is to enhance the operational security and robustness of the power system, by a more effective contribution of the DFIG controllers to the system controllability. To reach this goal, the crow-bar protection scheme is activated during the fault period when severe voltage sags occur in order to maintain the rotor-side converter connected to the DFIG. Immediately after the fault is cleared the crow-bar protection scheme is deactivated and simultaneously the rotor-side converter optimal controllers are turned on which permits the improvement of the converter ride-through capability and also contribute to enhance the overall power system stability margin. To validate the optimal proposed methodology several simulation results were obtained using a real electrical network which are presented in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/IREP.2010.5563275","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2010 IREP Symposium Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - VIII (IREP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IREP.2010.5563275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563238","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IREP Symposium Bulk Power System Dynamics and Control - VIII (IREP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559272/5563238/05563275.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using genetic algorithm to obtain optimal controllers for the DFIG converters to enhance power system operational security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563275/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using genetic algorithm to obtain optimal controllers for the DFIG converters to enhance power system operational security","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563275/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11520937","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using genetic algorithm to obtain optimal controllers for the DFIG converters to enhance power system operational security","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IREP2010062CD.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053416S","chronDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559272","isNumber":"5563238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559272","xplore-issue":"5563238","articleId":"5563275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5563283,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago R.

This small-signal model can be used for design purposes. The small-signal model is confronted with the nonlinear average model through time domain simulations and presents accurate dynamic behavior.

The focus is on the damping estimation under the ambient conditions of the power system. Damping estimation results are reviewed in case of the simulated data because then real damping is known and can be compared with the estimated damping. Various degrees of complexity of the simulation models are used: linear single and double pole pair models, and a detailed nonlinear system model of the Nordic power system. In the linear models, the real damping of the modes can be analytically calculated and compared with the estimated damping. Damping estimation performance is studied in different operating conditions of the studied simulation models. The main results are: frequency estimates are better than the damping estimates, other oscillation modes may affect the damping estimation, poor damping can be estimated more accurately than high damping, and the performance of the method is nearly similar regardless of the complexity of the simulation model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5563294/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11520956","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of wavelet-based damping estimation method under ambient conditions of the power system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of wavelet-based damping estimation method under ambient conditions of the power system","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IREP2010026CD.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068313S","chronDate":"1-6 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559272","isNumber":"5563238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559272","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5563238","articleId":"5563294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":5563502,"authors":[{"name":"Weimin Ma","affiliation":["School of Economics and management, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Weimin Ma","id":"37087344714"},{"name":"Yingying Wang","affiliation":["School of Economics and management, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yingying Wang","id":"37087184921"},{"name":"Ningfang Dong","affiliation":["School of Economics and management, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ningfang Dong","id":"37087838856"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6065-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6064-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6063-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563502","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563502","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","pricing","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock price prediction","BP neural network","momentum method","self-adaptive learning rate adjustment method","SIPM","MIPM","single-input prediction model","multiinput prediction model","SDIC Electric Power","Bank of China"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stock prediction","BP algorithm","Neural network","MSE"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEMMS.2010.5563502","pdfPath":"/iel5/5555292/5563371/05563502.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Emergency Management and Management Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Emergency Management and Management Sciences","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMMS.2010.5563502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on stock price prediction based on BP Neural Network","abstract":"In this paper, two kinds of methods, namely additional momentum method and self-adaptive learning rate adjustment method, are used to improve the BP algorithm.

To further reduce the complexity, we propose to combine the serving base station (BS) and the optimal three measurements with minimum WGDOP to reduce the number of subsets in cellular communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563546","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563529","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563529/05563546.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resilient back-propagation neural network for approximation weighted geometric dilution of precision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563546/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resilient back-propagation neural network for approximation weighted geometric dilution of precision","isConference":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5563546/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11520659","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilient back-propagation neural network for approximation weighted geometric dilution of precision","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"70013T1716d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069945S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5563529","articleId":"5563546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5563557,"authors":[{"name":"Vijaya Kumar Gunturu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"lastName":"Vijaya Kumar Gunturu","id":"37548001100"},{"name":"Ambalika Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"lastName":"Ambalika Sharma","id":"37537953800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563557","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"abstract":"Mammography is the most effective method for the early diagnosis and treatment of breast Cancer diseases. However, data sets collected by image sensors are generally contaminated by noise. This ensures the need for image enhancement to aid interpretation. This paper introduces an efficient enhancement algorithm of digital mammograms based on wavelet analysis and modified mathematical morphology. In this proposed method, we adopt wavelet-based level dependent thresholding algorithm and modified mathematical morphology algorithm to increase the contrast in mammograms to ease extraction of suspicious regions known as regions of interest (ROIs). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm gives significantly superior image quality and better Contrast Improvement Index (CII). Here, to prove the efficiency of this method, we have compared this with various well-known algorithms like VisuShrink and NormalShrink.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563521/05563557.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"327","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contrast enhancement of mammographic images using wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Transforms","Pollution measurement","Databases","Pixel","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","feature extraction","image denoising","image enhancement","image segmentation","image sensors","mammography","medical image processing","patient treatment","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mammographic image","wavelet transform","breast cancer disease","image sensors","image enhancement","digital mammograms","wavelet analysis","mathematical morphology","level dependent thresholding","suspicious region extraction","contrast improvement index","VisuShrink algorithm","NormalShrink algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mammograms","Modified Mathematical Morphology","Wavelets","Denoising"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Contrast enhancement of mammographic images using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5563557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517428","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrast enhancement of mammographic images using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"30074T1651D.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070815S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5563521","articleId":"5563557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5563558,"authors":[{"name":"Tangquan Qi","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Southwest China University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Tangquan Qi","id":"37087180818"},{"name":"Huiwen Deng","affiliation":["Institute of Logic and Intelligence, Southwest China University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Huiwen Deng","id":"37087982472"},{"name":"Weiping Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Logic and Intelligence, Southwest China University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Weiping Hu","id":"37087602042"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563558","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","fuzzy neural nets","image classification","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","eigcnfaces fisher linear discriminant","dynamic fuzzy neural network","natural illumination","ORL face database","human face classification","face feature extraction","classifiction error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","eigenfaces","fisher linear discriminant","feature extraction","dynamic fuzzy neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563558","abstract":"In order to solve the problem of face recognition in natural illumination, a new face recognition algorithm using Eigenface-Fisher Linear Discriminant (EFLD) and Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network (DFNN) is proposed in this paper, which can solve the dimension of feature, and deal with the problem of classification easily.

Due to the short lifetime of battery of portable device, reducing the energy consumption in this type of the device is sorely needed. In this paper, we proposed an energy efficient, low complexity, robust and secure watermarking algorithm in DS-CDMA communication. In this method, we spread multiple watermarks patterns with multiple orthogonal spreading codes and embedded them to DCT domain coefficients. In this way, the capacity, robustness and security can be improved simultaneously. In order to reduce power consumption, we proposed a low computational complexity frequency domain transformation for the watermarking embedding for DS-CDMA. Moreover, we propose a new architecture for the watermarking.

Nonsubsampled contourlet transform, which is a shift-invariant version of the contourlet transform, has better performance in representing image edges than separable wavelet for its anisotropy, directionality and shift-invariance, and is therefore well-suited for multi-scale edge enhancement. We modify the nonsubsampled contourlet coefficients of images in corresponding subbands via a new and operable nonlinear mapping function and take the noise into account for more precise reconstruction and better visualization. Experimental results on some medical images show that the proposed enhancement method effectively highlights subtle features while suppressing noise.

In order to enhance robustness to expression variations, a procedure of 3D face recognition based on depth image and SURF Operator is proposed. We use Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) method on the depth image to perform coarse recognition first to catch the highly ranked 3D faces. This stage can distinguish those faces that differ significantly and it is robust to expression variations to some extent. On the basis of this step, we extract the SURF features of the 2D gray images, that are corresponding only to those highly ranked 3D faces, to carry out the refined recognition. The experiments indicated a high recognition rate by our procedure even when the face expressions of training samples differ greatly from testing samples.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563632","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563553/05563632.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D face recognition by SURF operator based on depth image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563632/","displayDocTitle":"3D face recognition by SURF operator based on depth image","volume":"9","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11520304","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563632/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D face recognition by SURF operator based on depth image","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"9052T1258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092316S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5563553","articleId":"5563632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5563634,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpana.C.

This paper presents comparative analysis of two normalization techniques namely, DCT in Log domain and 2-point normalization method.. The DCT is employed to compensate for illumination variations in the logarithm domain. Since illumination variation lies mainly in the low frequency band, an appropriate number of DCT coefficients are truncated to reduce the variations under different lighting conditions. The nearest neighbor classifier based on Euclidean distance is employed for classification. The 2-point normalization method considers only center points of eyes. Preprocessing is done using the Gaussian filter. Based on the center points of eyes the rotation of image is performed. Rotated image is masked using an ellipse. Histogram equalization is performed on the unmasked part of the image. The Log-Gabor filter of 5 \u00d7 5 window size is used to extract the features. The Cosine based distance method is used for classification. Experimental results on the Yale B and Cafe database show that the proposed approach of normalized dataset improves the performance significantly for the face images with large illumination and expression variations. The face recognition system based on Log-Gabor filter achieves the recognition accuracy of 85% to 93%, and that based on DCT normalization achieves the recognition accuracy of 97% to 100% using the above databases.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563634","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563531/05563634.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of DCT in logarithm domain and two -point normalization method for illumination and expression variation in face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563634/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of DCT in logarithm domain and two -point normalization method for illumination and expression variation in face recognition","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517596","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563634/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of DCT in logarithm domain and two -point normalization method for illumination and expression variation in face recognition","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"20026T851d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082702S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563531","articleId":"5563634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5563666,"authors":[{"name":"Pirooz Shamsinejad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Pirooz","lastName":"Shamsinejad","id":"37543090400"},{"name":"Mohammad Saraee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Saraee","id":"37372652400"},{"name":"Farid Sheikholeslam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Farid","lastName":"Sheikholeslam","id":"37272803000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563666","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563666","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous mobile robot","genetic algorithm","global path planning","local path planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Local Path Planner","Genetic Algorithm","Navigation of Autonomous Mobile Robot"]}],"abstract":"One of the most important issues for autonomous mobile robots is finding paths in their environment.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is able to withstand a variety of attacks including common geometric attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563757","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563692/05563757.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust image watermarking based on singular value decomposition and discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563757/","displayDocTitle":"Robust image watermarking based on singular value decomposition and discrete wavelet transform","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11520508","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563757/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust image watermarking based on singular value decomposition and discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"50073T230d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048794S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5563692","articleId":"5563757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5563770,"authors":[{"name":"Leifu Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science, College of Science, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China"],"lastName":"Leifu Gao","id":"37533490000"},{"name":"Changli Feng","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science, College of Science, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China"],"lastName":"Changli Feng","id":"37533693100"},{"name":"Haiyan Wei","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science, College of Science, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China"],"lastName":"Haiyan Wei","id":"37540072300"},{"name":"Xiaokai Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science, College of Science, Liaoning Technical University, Fuxin, China"],"lastName":"Xiaokai Chang","id":"37529716500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563770","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563770","abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563770","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563553/05563770.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"517","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Recurrent Project Neural Network for solving Semidefinite Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563770/","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: After careful and considered review of the content of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE's Publication Principles.

But many of them are not sufficient and effective. Most intrusion detection systems for mobile ad hoc networks are focusing on either routing protocols or its efficiency, but it fails to address the security issues. Some of the nodes may be selfish, for example, by not forwarding the packets to the destination, thereby saving the battery power. Some others may act malicious by launching security attacks like denial of service or hack the information. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. This paper incorporates agents and data mining techniques to prevent anomaly intrusion in mobile adhoc networks. Innuendo, presenting an anomaly detection system comprises of detection modules for detecting anomalies in each layer. Home agents present in each system collects the data from its own system and using data mining techniques to observed the local anomalies. The Mobile agents monitoring the neighboring nodes and collect the information from neighboring home agents to determine the correlation among the observed anomalous patterns before it will send the data. This system was able to stop all of the successful attacks in an adhoc networks and reduce the false alarm positives.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563804","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563529/05563804.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient anomaly intrusion detection system in adhoc networks by mobile agents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563804/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient anomaly intrusion detection system in adhoc networks by mobile agents","volume":"7","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11518240","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563804/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient anomaly intrusion detection system in adhoc networks by mobile agents","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"70016T1903d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04592S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5563529","articleId":"5563804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5563806,"authors":[{"name":"Pragya Pallavi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, KIlT University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"firstName":"Pragya","lastName":"Pallavi","id":"37547645000"},{"name":"Pradipta Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunication, Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, KIlT University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"firstName":"Pradipta","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37545020500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563806","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","code division multiple access","error statistics","phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["muticairier CDMA","BPSK modulation","Rayleigh channel","multicarrier code division multiple access","high speed wireless communication","MC-CDMA","inter symbol interference","equal gain combining","maximal uplink ratio combining","additive white Gaussian noise","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MCCDMA","BPSK Modulation","Rayleigh channel","AWGN","EGC","MRC"]}],"abstract":"Multi-carrier code division multiple access (MCCDMA) is an attractive choice for high speed wireless communication as it mitigates the problem of inter symbol interference (ISI) and also exploits frequency diversity.

In this paper we present a system that is capable of adapting some important resources (type of modulation, code rate and number of subcarriers) for blurred channel conditions. The system in this work is mainly designed for WiMAX, which proved to be one of the prominent technologies in providing Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) in metropolitan areas with a simpler installation and lower cost than the wired alternatives. The approach depends on using cognitive radio for decision making which uses fuzzy logic for reasoning. The cognitive engine controls the type of modulation, code rate and number of subcarriers in order to maintain a good system throughput without wasting available bandwidth. Fuzzy logic reasoning in the cognitive engine was chosen because it is well suited for situations of uncertainty, incompleteness and heterogeneity information, in the case of fast changing radio environments. The results showed that new combinations of modulation type, code rate and number of subcarriers should be considered in WiMAX since in most cases it outperforms the standard in error probability and spectral efficiency, especially in a fast changing radio environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11520513","htmlLink":"/document/5563827/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource management for a vague environment using cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource management for a vague environment using cognitive radio","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"50122T971xdc1p.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051435S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563692","articleId":"5563827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5563835,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Tiejun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yang Tiejun","id":"37546310400"},{"name":"Fu Hongliang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"lastName":"Fu Hongliang","id":"37547576900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563835","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"abstract":"The throughout of wireless communication systems can be improved by adding multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver to create multiple-input multiple-output channels. To avoid the prohibitive complexity involved in the ML detectors, some special detectors were proposed to improve the performance-complexity trade-off, such as zero-forcing (ZF), minimum mean-square (MMSE), vertical Bell labs layered space-time (VBLAST), sphere detection (SD), etc, but the performance and complexity gaps between the optimal detector and the suboptimal detector leaves substantial room for improvement. In order to improve the detection performance, an improved algorithm which combines ordered-QR decomposition algorithm with CHASE detection framework was presented, which can reduce computational complexity and error spread effectively.

However, many of these algorithms remove the fine details and smooth the structures of the image when removing noise. The wavelet coefficient magnitude sum (WCMS) algorithm can preserve edges, but it is at the expense of removing noise. The Non-Local means algorithm can removing noise effective. But it tend to cause distortion ( eg white). Meanwhile, when the noise is large, the method is not so effective. In this paper, we propose an efficient denoising algorithm. we denoised the image with non-local means algorithm in the spatial domain and WCMS algorithm in wavelet domain, weighted, combined them and got the image that we want. The experiment shows that our algorithm can improve PSNR form 0.6 dB to 1.0 dB and the image boundary is more clearly.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563853","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563519/05563853.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image denoising based on Non-Local means and multi-scale dyadic wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563853/","displayDocTitle":"Image denoising based on Non-Local means and multi-scale dyadic wavelet transform","volume":"6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517504","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5563853/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image denoising based on Non-Local means and multi-scale dyadic wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"60076T1212d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06944S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563519","articleId":"5563853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5563856,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yuqi","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yang Yuqi","id":"37087838284"},{"name":"Gao Xiaoguang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Gao Xiaoguang","id":"37086976717"},{"name":"Feng Xiaoyi","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Feng Xiaoyi","id":"37087789455"},{"name":"Yan Kun","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yan Kun","id":"37087721023"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563856","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"abstract":"Amplitude limiting of SAR target is one important preprocessing procedure in SAR target recognition.

To counter the influence of faulty components, it is essential to reach a common agreement in the presence of faults before performing certain tasks. However, the agreement problem is fundamental to fault-tolerant distributed systems. In previous studies, protocols dealing with the agreement problem have focused on a network topology with faulty hardware components. However, cloud computing, an Internet-based development in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a service over the Internet has become a significant issue. Therefore, previous protocols for the agreement problem with fallible hardware are not suitable for a cloud computing environment with fallible processes. To enhance fault tolerance, the agreement problem in a cloud computing environment with fallible processes is revisited in this study. The proposed protocol can solve the agreement problem with a minimal number of rounds of message exchange and tolerates a maximal number of faulty processes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563682/05563894.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5563894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5563894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The anatomy study of efficient agreement in a cloud computing environment with fallible processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Clouds","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","software fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anatomy study","cloud computing environment","fallible processes","fault tolerance","agreement problem","fault-tolerant distributed systems","protocols","network topology","faulty hardware components","Internet based development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agreement problem","Byzantine agreement","Consensus problem","Interactive consistency","Distributed system","Fault-tolerance","Cloud computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5563894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"The anatomy study of efficient agreement in a cloud computing environment with fallible processes","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5563894/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11518118","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The anatomy study of efficient agreement in a cloud computing environment with fallible processes","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"10027T103d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07616S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5563682","articleId":"5563894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5563916,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaolei Duan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhaolei Duan","id":"37530487300"},{"name":"Zhimin Gu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhimin Gu","id":"37291583700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5563916","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Reliability","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastic Web proxy cache cluster","cloud computing","service quality","resource efficiency","on demand characteristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Proxy Cache","Elastic Web Proxy Cache Cluster","Load Balancing","Cloud Computing"]}],"abstract":"In order to relieve the conflict between improving service quality and enhancing resource efficiency in Web proxy cache cluster, a new elastic Web proxy cache cluster-EWPCC is presented.

After extracting individual narrowband channels from wideband signal, the sample rate is much higher than single channel bandwidth. It is necessary to resample the signal with a lower rate to reduce data redundancy. And the receiver should has the capability of operating in all sorts of communication standard. So sensitive SRC(sample rate conversion) is necessary in the receiver. The paper proposed an efficient SRC architecture and an optimized algorithm for assigning changing rate factor. The architecture is programmable, hardware sharing, with lower power consumption, which take advantage of renewed comb filters to improve alias rejection and reduce power consumption of the decimation at high rate. The optimized algorithm is flexible and simple. It can realize SRC efficiently by optimum composition of algorithmand architecture.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564017","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563521/05564017.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"390","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The efficient sample rate conversion architecture in digital IF receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"The efficient sample rate conversion architecture in digital IF receiver","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5564017/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517400","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564017/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The efficient sample rate conversion architecture in digital IF receiver","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"30088T1673D.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039759S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563521","articleId":"5564017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5564030,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Wei","affiliation":["Communication Teaching & Research Section, Air Force Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Cheng Wei","id":"37534550900"},{"name":"Yang Rui-juan","affiliation":["Communication Teaching & Research Section, Air Force Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Yang Rui-juan","id":"38276589400"},{"name":"Fan Qi-xing","affiliation":["Communication Teaching & Research Section, Air Force Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Fan Qi-xing","id":"38275214300"},{"name":"Huang Mei-rong","affiliation":["Communication Teaching & Research Section, Air Force Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Huang Mei-rong","id":"38272923400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564030","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","error statistics","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation method","HF OFDM systems","greedy algorithm","finite granularity bit allocation","computational complexity","bit preassign algorithm","power loading algorithm","subchannel preallocation","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","High Frequency Communication","Adaptive Modulation"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive HF OFDM system can improve the transmission performance by bit and power loading based on the characteristic of subchannel.

Past research shows that medical database of disease can be train by using various neural network models. Many medical problems face the problem of curse of dimensionality due to the excessively large number of input attributes. Breast cancer is one such problem. We propose the use of modular neural network for effective diagnosis. In the proposed methodology four modules are made; each module gets half the problem attributes which are trained and tested by two neural network models, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Radial Basis Function (RBFN). Integration is done using a probabilistic sum rule. The modular neural network gave an accuracy of 95.75% over training data and 98.22% over testing accuracy, which was experimentally determined to be better than monolithic neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564054","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563529/05564054.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of breast cancer by modular neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical diagnostic imaging","Multi-layer neural network","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","cancer","data analysis","medical information systems","patient diagnosis","probability","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast cancer","modular neural network","disease","medical database","back propagation neural network","radial basis function","probabilistic sum rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medical Expert System","Modular Neural Network","Diagnostic System","Back Propagation Neural Network","Radial Basis Function Network","Breast Cancer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis of breast cancer by modular neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5564054/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11520654","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis of breast cancer by modular neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"70026T1971d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059423S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5563529","articleId":"5564054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5564072,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The concept of ROI (Region Of Interest) and RONI (Region Of Non Interest) were applied. Watermark embedded can be used to detect tampering and recovery of the image can be done. The watermark is also reversible.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Variable speed drives","Biomedical imaging","Book reviews","Decoding","Ultrasonic variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","medical image processing","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reversible medical image watermarking","tamper detection","tamper recovery","authenticity","image integrity","recovery watermarking scheme","ultrasound grayscale image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","watermark","tamper detection","recovery","reversible","medical image"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564078","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563692/05564078.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible medical image watermarking for tamper detection and recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reversible medical image watermarking for tamper detection and recovery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564078/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5564078/","accessionNumber":"11520606","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible medical image watermarking for tamper detection and recovery","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"50089T658d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056269S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5563692","articleId":"5564078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5564082,"authors":[{"name":"Yaohui Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Yaohui Wang","id":"37540216700"},{"name":"Hongjian Chu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Hongjian Chu","id":"37535901700"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Qu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoyang Qu","id":"37401755100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564082","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lifting equipment","World Wide Web","Educational institutions","Filling","Transaction databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern clustering","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database anomalous detection model","user behavior profile mining","K-means clustering algorithm","Apriori algorithm","association rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["database anomalous detection","users' behavior profile","association rule"]}],"abstract":"A model of database anomalous detection is designed in this paper.

It can optimize the classification effect with little and poor representative labeled samples. A weakness of this method is one need determine the number of unlabeled samples which belongs to a specific class before iteration, and the labeling efficiency is very low. We proposed an unlabeled samples labeling method of TSVM for remote sensing image. With this method, we need not know the ratio of the unlabeled samples among classes any more. The first step of our method is clustering, and the number of the clusters must be more than 5 times as the number of classes to be classified. After clustering we get the mean value and the standard deviation of every cluster. Then we labeled the unlabeled samples which contained in the hyper-ball with the mean value as ball-center and the standard deviation as radius a time, instead of labeled one pair of unlabeled samples a time. The classification experiments results prove that the proposed method is not only effective but also can improve the classification accuracy to some extent.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unlabeled samples labeling method","TSVM","remote sensing image","transductive SVM","semisupervised method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TSVM","labeling method","remote sensing classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564105","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563692/05564105.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unlabeled samples labeling method of TSVM for remote sensing image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An unlabeled samples labeling method of TSVM for remote sensing image","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564105/","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5564105/","accessionNumber":"11520471","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unlabeled samples labeling method of TSVM for remote sensing image","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"50061T1947d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045743S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563692","articleId":"5564105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5564114,"authors":[{"name":"Juanjuan Min","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, China"],"firstName":"Juanjuan","lastName":"Min","id":"37531881200"},{"name":"Huazhong Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, China"],"lastName":"Huazhong Liu","id":"37537711800"},{"name":"Anyuan Deng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, China"],"lastName":"Anyuan Deng","id":"37409020000"},{"name":"Jihong Ding","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Jiujiang University, Jiujiang, China"],"lastName":"Jihong Ding","id":"37537856500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564114","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","genetic algorithms","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive load balancing optimization scheduling","cluster server","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cluster server","load balancing","genetic algorithm","cross-coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564114","abstract":"The load balancing scheduling is the core of the load balancing technology in the cluster system.

A restraint function utilizing the amplitude of the signal was constructed in this article. The function must approach zero when the amplitude was chosen. The cost function was converted into a restraint function. The restraint stem includes the information of module property and phase characteristic.

In this paper a novel signal detection scheme based on Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) is proposed for MIMO-OFDM systems. Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) is based on the concept and principles of quantum computing, such as quantum bit and superposition of states. Instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, QGA uses a Q-bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation and a Q-bit individual as a string of Q-bits. A Q-gate is introduced as a variation operator to drive the individuals toward better solutions. An analysis is given to the theoretical basis and practical performance of the proposed scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed detector outperforms the VBLAST (Vertical Bell Layered Space Time) in MIMO-OFDM systems. At bit error rate 1e-3, the proposed scheme can obtain a 2dB gain to VBLAST algorithms based on MIMO-OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5564296","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557901/5564160/05564296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5564296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5564160","startPage":"439","endPage":"442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel detection scheme with Quantum Genetic Algorithm in MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel detection scheme with Quantum Genetic Algorithm in MIMO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564296/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11524952","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5564296/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel detection scheme with Quantum Genetic Algorithm in MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039153S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557901","isNumber":"5564160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557901","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5564160","articleId":"5564296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5564299,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghong Cao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yinghong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37535624500"},{"name":"Zhe Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291479700"},{"name":"Fuliang Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Fuliang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37269393800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7050-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7047-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564299","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"abstract":"In this paper, we concentrate on the downlink precoding scheme for the multi-user MIMO system with 4 \u00d7 4 Quasi-orthogonal space time block codes (QSTBC). An iterative precoding scheme based on the signal-to-leakage-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization is proposed. This precoding scheme is general to different QSTBCs. By choosing the complex scalars properly, a simple solution of the optimization problem is achieved and the symbols can be decoded separately at each receiver. Our scheme is more robust to the number of users within the system. By using an iterative optimization approach, it eliminates the co-channel interference (CCI) more efficiently.

Distant hybridization strategy and a new method of adaptively changing crossover rate are presented by combining the scheme of multi-population and the thought of elitist population. Considered the different range of decision variables, the new definitions of individual distance and population distance are put forward, which avoids the false distance caused by traditional hamming distance.

The common algorithm for this is firstly calculating the pixels' sums in each sub-rectangle region of a mask, then multiplying the coefficients and adding them together. This way may cause some repeatable calculations, so the fast Hessian detector's speed is influenced. In order to make the filter process much faster, an optimized algorithm for Gaussian second order derivative filters was proposed. Firstly, the multiplication operators was all replaced by additions. Then, use variants instead of repeatable steps. At last, complexity of the whole convolution process was decreased. Verified by the experimental results, fast Hessian detector based on the optimized filter algorithm was much faster than that on the common method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564462","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563533/05564462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563533","startPage":"623","endPage":"627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized algorithm for Gaussian second order derivative filters in fast Hessian detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized algorithm for Gaussian second order derivative filters in fast Hessian detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564462/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517820","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5564462/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized algorithm for Gaussian second order derivative filters in fast Hessian detector","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"40128T1060d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09176S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5563533","articleId":"5564462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5564476,"authors":[{"name":"Xianjun Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xianjun Shen","id":"37536748600"},{"name":"Caixia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Caixia Chen","id":"37539314600"},{"name":"Jincai Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jincai Yang","id":"37538622200"},{"name":"Zhifeng Chi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Zhifeng Chi","id":"37533018500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564476","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564476","abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564476","startPage":"15","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563543","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563543/05564476.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Stochastic disturbance particle swarm optimization algorithm based On attractive operator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564476/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Stochastic disturbance particle swarm optimization algorithm based On attractive operator","isConference":true,"volume":"8","accessionNumber":"11517973","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: After careful and considered review of the content of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE's Publication Principles.

A Reformulated inversionless-Berlekamp-Massey algorithm is adopted in order to eliminate the finite-field inverter and to reduce the hardware complexity. Furthermore, we proposed a Direct reformulated-inversionless Berlekamp-Massey algorithm (DriBM). While in the Chien Search stage, the Constant-Factor Multiplication-Free Matrix transform is also introduced to avoid expensiveness which significantly reduce the area and critical path. Moreover, we also developed Extended Fast Chien Search algorithm which significantly reduce computation complexity and the area by nearly 33% compared to Constant-Factor MFTM. Using our proposed design, we design a BCH(15,7) decoder which can reach speed up to 2.2 GHz with total area of is 8170 \u03bcm2 using 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS standard cell technology. The merits of the proposed algorithms and architecture are very efficient and fast. The implementation of the proposed BCH decoder architecture is also scalable to higher n block lengths and t number of correctable error, by using the same concept as we design BCH(63,51) using the same concept as BCH(15,7). In addition to the parallel BCH Decoder, we also design an area efficient parallel GF multiplier and squarer which minimized the number of logic gates. This design has been implemented and verified on Altera DE2 FPGA using codeword with various error positions and weight (0-2 guaranteed error correction). Due to its low complexity, it is suitable for VLSI implementation and also provide excellent tradeoffs between the correcting capacity, speed and area penalties.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564592","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563533/05564592.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-fast-scalable BCH decoder with efficient-Extended Fast Chien Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-fast-scalable BCH decoder with efficient-Extended Fast Chien Search","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5564592/","accessionNumber":"11517869","volume":"4","publicationDate":"July 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-fast-scalable BCH decoder with efficient-Extended Fast Chien Search","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"40069T773gdd.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053332S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5563533","articleId":"5564592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5564597,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zheng","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086894147"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37309169100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564597","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564597","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564597","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563543/05564597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","startPage":"247","endPage":"251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Robust design method in motion mechanism using inverse-proportional inertia weight quantum-behaved particle swarm algorithm","abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: After careful and considered review of the content of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE's Publication Principles.

In this work we consider a scenario where a base station (source) transmits information to a user (destination) via a relay with amplify-and-forward technique. Using MPSK modulation, we first derive a closed-form symbol error rate (SER) formulation and corresponding lower bound which converges to the same limit as the theoretical upper bound in high signal to noise ratio (SNR). And we then minimize the SER by applying optimal power allocation technique (OPA) with mean channel gains. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the equal power allocation scheme in high SNR with a good performance improvement.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","phase shift keying","radiocommunication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication system","wireless communication system","spatial diversity","relay channels","base station","amplify-and-forward technique","MPSK modulation","closed-form symbol error rate formulation","optimal power allocation technique","mean channel gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communication","Power allocation","MPSK","Amplify-and-Forward","Relay channel","SER"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564785","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563529/05564785.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of relay channel with amplify-and-forward in cooperative communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of relay channel with amplify-and-forward in cooperative communication system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564785/","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5564785/","accessionNumber":"11518253","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of relay channel with amplify-and-forward in cooperative communication system","confLoc":"Chengdu","sourcePdf":"70133T2664d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055948S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5563529","articleId":"5564785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5564799,"authors":[{"name":"Henriques Marcelino","affiliation":["Computer & Information School, Si Chuan Network Communication Technology Key Laboratory, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Henriques","lastName":"Marcelino","id":"38274659100"},{"name":"Zeng Hua-shen","affiliation":["Computer & Information School, Si Chuan Network Communication Technology Key Laboratory, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zeng Hua-shen","id":"38272189100"},{"name":"Guan Yanbin","affiliation":["Computer & Information School, Si Chuan Network Communication Technology Key Laboratory, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Guan Yanbin","id":"38275816800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564799","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":319},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","WiMAX","Modulation","Frequency division multiaccess","OFDM","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio networks","telecommunication standards","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next generation wireless communication networks","OFDMA transmission system","WiMAX IEEE 802.16m","3GPP LTE advanced systems communication","hybrid environment systems","downlink models","uplink models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NGWNs","OFDMA","WiMAX","LTE","Performance analysis"]}],"abstract":"Although many researchers have written about OFDMA transmission system, it needs more attention and analysis in next generation wireless networks.

With consideration of the diversity of Spectrum OPportunity (SOP) set for each cognitive user, the optimal end-to-end path and channel on each hop are found in route resolve procedure by cross-layer design among the physical layer, MAC layer and network layer.

As a result, the offset factor in our modified algorithm can be calculated adaptively and more efficiently according to the previous decoding procedure, which can minimize the decoding degradation compared with the Belief Propagation decoding algorithm. The simulation results show that, compared with the original Offset Min-Sum decoding algorithm, our modified algorithm can achieve noticeable performance improvement with minor extra hardware complexity.

In most of wireless communications, we have applied the training sequences as known signal at the receiver for estimating the channel as well as the transmitted signal. Nowadays, many paid services in the entertainment industry have required the high security for their data and this issue is challenge which needs to be solved. Recently, the semi-blind channel estimations have contributed in term of remarkable enhancement in the total bandwidth efficiency of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To obtain the high data rate demands, there is a fewer training symbols using in these semi-blind algorithms. However, each system model must be satisfied the safe data for both the suppliers and the customers. Based on the information theory, we propose the new transmit structure with the training data embedding secure symbols for distinguishing authorized users and the eavesdroppers. This solution is so-called security on the physical level which is considered as the robust solution for processing by the traditional software. In this investigation, we also focus on normalized mean square error (NMSE) analysis for different performance of two types of users mentioned. Simulation results confirm our modified scheme and illustrate that the semi-blind channel estimation with embedded secure data is capable of improving the security of the overall system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564933","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563531/05564933.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563531","startPage":"406","endPage":"409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new training sequence for secure channel estimation in MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new training sequence for secure channel estimation in MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564933/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517704","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5564933/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new training sequence for secure channel estimation in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"20089T569d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037894S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563531","articleId":"5564933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5564943,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Hu","affiliation":["Broadband Communication Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Gao Hu","id":"37532311700"},{"name":"Wu Muqing","affiliation":["Broadband Communication Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wu Muqing","id":"37318369800"},{"name":"Xu Chunxiu","affiliation":["Broadband Communication Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xu Chunxiu","id":"37541580400"},{"name":"Wu Qianqian","affiliation":["Broadband Communication Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wu Qianqian","id":"37541580000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564943","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564943","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitaper method","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio networks","nonparametric spectrum estimation","Slepian sequences","adaptive weighting MTM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","multitaper method","Slepian sequences","threshold decision"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564943","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563531/05564943.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved multitaper method for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Spectrum sensing is one of the most basic issues in cognitive radio (CR), upon which the other operations to increase the spectrum utilization could be carried out. Therefore, an accurate, reliable and real-time method to detect the unused spectrum and available bands is required urgently. To fulfill the needs, several schemes have been introduced, among which the multitaper method (MTM) for nonparametric spectrum estimation is the most appealing. In the paper, we propose an improved method based on MTM, making the detection more effective and robust. To concentrate the power in a fixed bandwidth, Slepian sequences have been employed in MTM, and it has a good performance when only using the low-order tapers. But as the number of tapers increases, it hardly works well. Consequently, the adaptive weighting MTM (AW-MTM) are proposed to solve the problem. Numerical results show that AW-MTM has a much better performance than conventional methods for spectrum sensing in CR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564943/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"11517725","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5564943/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved multitaper method for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved multitaper method for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"20086T562d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048259S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5563531","articleId":"5564943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5564960,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuang Xiaoyan","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhuang Xiaoyan","id":"37530002800"},{"name":"Wang Houjun","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Wang Houjun","id":"37282974900"},{"name":"Dai Zhijian","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Dai Zhijian","id":"37546115900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5564960","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":957},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","signal detection","signal sampling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","compressed sensing","data acquisition","information processing","data compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","data compression","compressed sensing","sparsity"]}],"abstract":"The data collected through high densely distributed wireless sensor networks is immense. The asymmetry between the data acquisition and information processing makes a great challenge to the restriction of energy and computation consumption of the sensor nodes, and it limits the application of wireless sensor networks. However, the recent works show that compressed sensing can break through this limitation of asymmetry. Compressed sensing is an emerging theory that is based on the fact that a signal can be recovered through a relatively small number of random projections which contain most of its salient information. In this paper, we introduce the background of compressive sensing, and then applications of compressed sensing in wireless sensor networks are presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564960","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563553/05564960.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563553","startPage":"90","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless sensor networks based on compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless sensor networks based on compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11520456","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5564960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless sensor networks based on compressed sensing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"9018T165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052817S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5563553","articleId":"5564960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5564988,"authors":[{"name":"M.

OFDM uses a number of independent sub carriers of different frequencies for modulation. The resultant signals have very large PAPR which can significantly impact the power power efficiency and performance of a High Power Amplifier (HPA). We propose performing simple transformations on Sub Optimum Partial Transmit Sequence (SOPTS) combined with RGA. PAPR reduction of upto 5dB can be obtained and further side information need not be transmitted to the receiver. To further evaluate the PAPR reductions we compare the proposed scheme with the Sub optimum Partial Transmit Sequence (SOPTS) scheme based on Orthogonal Greedy algorithm (OGA). The results show that the proposed scheme offer better PAPR reduction than the OGA based SOPTS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563682/05564988.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"574","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5564988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5564988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RGA based approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM systems","relaxed greedy algorithm","RGA","PAPR reduction","reduce peak to average power ratio","independent sub carriers","high power amplifier","sub optimum partial transmit sequence","SOPTS","radio receiver","orthogonal greedy algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","OGA","RGA","PAPR","SOPTS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5564988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"RGA based approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5564988/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11518043","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RGA based approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"10125T336d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038509S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","xplore-issue":"5563682","articleId":"5564988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5565022,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Control & Information College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yanjun Chen","id":"37087395602"},{"name":"Quan Pan","affiliation":["Institute of Control & Information College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Quan Pan","id":"37087066242"},{"name":"Yan Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Control & Information College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yan Liang","id":"37087203696"},{"name":"Zhentao Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Control & Information College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Zhentao Hu","id":"37087395047"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565022","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":900},"abstract":"Target localization and tracking is the canonical application of Wireless Sensor Networks. Unlike a centralized system, a sensor network is subject to a unique set of resource constraints such as limited on-board battery power and limited network communication bandwidth. So the traditional tracking algorithm can be directly used in WSN. Therefore efficient localization algorithms that consume less energy for computation and less bandwidth for communication are needed. The weighted centroid localization algorithm (WCL) based on RSSI is applied in most of actual systems. Only one uniform path loss exponent obtained through experiments is used to calculate the weights of nodes in general WCL. It is well known that the path loss exponent is the essential reflection of sensing surroundings. The actual sensing scenario can't be revealed in the traditional WCL algorithm, and therefore it is not appropriate that only one exponent is accepted all through the area covered by the sensor nodes. A new algorithm, adaptively weighted centroid localization (AWCL), is proposed in this paper. Firstly a more reasonable path loss exponent is adaptively estimated according to the surroundings where the target nodes situates. Secondly the target position will be calculated by using the weighted centroid method in which exponents estimated in the first stage are adopted. Theoretical analysis are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed localization method, the simulation results show that that the proposed algorithm outperforms the general WCL algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Argon","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target tracking","telecommunication networks","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive weighted centroid target localization","AWCL","received signal strength indicator","RSSI","wireless sensor networks","WSN","target tracking","network communication bandwidth","sensor nodes","path loss exponent","target nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Sensor Networks","Weighted Centroid Localization","path loss exponent"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5565022","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563553/05565022.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5565022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AWCL: Adaptive weighted centroid target localization algorithm based on RSSI in WSN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"AWCL: Adaptive weighted centroid target localization algorithm based on RSSI in WSN","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565022/","isConference":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565022/","accessionNumber":"11520308","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AWCL: Adaptive weighted centroid target localization algorithm based on RSSI in WSN","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"9071T1387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053706S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5563553","articleId":"5565022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5565032,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Sadegh Norouzzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Sadegh","lastName":"Norouzzadeh","id":"37545824500"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Ahmadzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Ahmadzadeh","id":"37442641000"},{"name":"Maziar Palhang","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Maziar","lastName":"Palhang","id":"37411404400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565032","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565032","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an optimization algorith that has received much attention in recent years.

To improve PSO performance on global optimization problems, this paper proposes a novel approach, called Plowing PSO algorithm, through introductng a new operator to PSO. The proposed approach combines the exploration ability of random search with the features of PSO. Our approach is validated using ten common complex unimodal/multimodal bencmark functions. The simulation results demostrate that the proposed approach is superior in avoiding premature convergence to standard PSO, and five variation of it.

We build a subcarrier allocation model based on graph-coloring theory. And then, considering the interference between cognitive users (CUs) and time and space difference between the available spectrums of CUs as two constraints, we propose the rand algorithm, greedy algorithm and Max-Min algorithm for subcarrier allocation in CR NC-OFDM system. The rand algorithm is simple, but can't optimize system throughput. The greedy algorithm can gain the best throughput performance but has poor fairness performance. The Max-Min algorithm can not only achieve better throughput performance but also good user fairness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550976/5563531/05565163.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"540","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5565163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSIT.2010.5565163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5563531","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier allocation algorithms based on graph-coloring in Cognitive Radio NC-OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Greedy algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","graph colouring","greedy algorithms","interference (signal)","minimax techniques","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier allocation","graph coloring","cognitive radio","non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","NC-OFDM system","spectrum utilization efficiency","max-min algorithm","cognitive users","greedy algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","NC-OFDM","graph-coloring model","subcarrier allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier allocation algorithms based on graph-coloring in Cognitive Radio NC-OFDM system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5565163/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517627","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier allocation algorithms based on graph-coloring in Cognitive Radio NC-OFDM system","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"20119T612d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047149S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5563531","articleId":"5565163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5565165,"authors":[{"name":"Manish K Thakur","affiliation":["Department of CSE & IT, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Manish K","lastName":"Thakur","id":"37411193200"},{"name":"Monika Kumari","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIlT University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"firstName":"Monika","lastName":"Kumari","id":"37089144415"},{"name":"Madhabananda Das","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, KIlT University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"firstName":"Madhabananda","lastName":"Das","id":"37085478780"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5540-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5537-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5539-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565165","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architectural CAD","genetic algorithms","planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architectural layout planning","genetic algorithms","topological arrangement","Dijkstra algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["architectural layout planning","topological","dimensional","evacuation","Vaastu","Genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565165","abstract":"This paper presents a model which generates architectural layout for a single flat having regular shaped spaces; Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen, Balcony, Living and Dining Room.

The novelty of our approach is the introduction of a mask and a probabilistic approach for adjustment of the grey constant values. In addition, because of our novel color cooccurrence approach, our algorithm can distinguish between \u201cmoving\u201d background and moving foreground. The results prove that our method perform the best among the compared methods and manage to reduce the error rate by half compared to the Renno et al. method.

SQL injection constitutes a mean by which data or information can be stolen from the database. Most applications are designed in a way that the request of data from database is done through user inputs. An attacker can inject in the original SQL query and obtain, change, or view data for which he does not have permission. The aim of our research is to develop a method that detects and prevents SQL injection attacks by checking whether user inputs cause changes in the query's intended result. We proposed a method to detect SQL injection attacks by using Query tokenization that is implemented by the QueryParser method. When attacker is making SQL injection he should probably use a space, single quotes or double dashes in his input. Our method consists of tokenizing original query and a query with injection separately, the tokenization is performed by detecting a space, single quote or double dashes and all strings before each symbol constitute a token. After tokens are formed they all make an array for which every token is an element of the array. Two arrays resulting from both original query and a query with injection are obtained and their lengths are compared to detect whether there is injection or not. As a result, the access to data can be granted or denied once the lengths of the arrays are the same or different respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11517650","htmlLink":"/document/5565202/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of Query tokenization to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Query tokenization to detect and prevent SQL injection attacks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"20096T581d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023307S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550976","isNumber":"5563531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550976","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5563531","articleId":"5565202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5565218,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293616300"},{"name":"Jian Tian","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Tian","id":"37535785400"},{"name":"Mengjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Mengjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085761873"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7050-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7047-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565218","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565218","abstract":"In RBF neural network designing, hidden neuron number and parameter influence the performance of network.

A problem that still remains is that, however, the factors resulted from it may not necessarily be realistically interpretable. Some constraints are usually added to the standard NMF to generate such interpretive results. In this paper, a minimum-volume constrained NMF is proposed and an efficient multiplicative update algorithm is developed based on the natural gradient optimization. The proposed method can be applied to the blind source separation (BSS) problem, a hot topic with many potential applications, especially if the sources are mutually dependent. Simulation results of BSS for images show the superiority of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557901/5564160/05565228.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5565228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5565228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5564160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation by nonnegative matrix factorization with minimum-volume constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Matrix decomposition","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","gradient methods","matrix decomposition","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","nonnegative matrix factorization","minimum-volume constraint","multiplicative update algorithm","natural gradient optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation by nonnegative matrix factorization with minimum-volume constraint","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11524820","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation by nonnegative matrix factorization with minimum-volume constraint","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070316S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557901","isNumber":"5564160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557901","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5564160","articleId":"5565228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5565246,"authors":[{"name":"Fuming Sun","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fuming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291914800"},{"name":"Haiyang Wang","affiliation":["JiangNan Institute of Computing Technology, China"],"firstName":"Haiyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538502600"},{"name":"Fei Fu","affiliation":["People''s Liberation Army, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Fu","id":"37546668700"},{"name":"Xiaoying Li","affiliation":["Beijing Research and Development Center, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoying","lastName":"Li","id":"37293192100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7050-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7047-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565246","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":788},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Power demand","Transistors","Logic gates","Estimation","Integrated circuit modeling","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","FPGA low power design","power supply","thermal component selection","power budget","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"Due to direct impact on power supply and thermal component selection, power consideration within the system power budget and operation environment is becoming increasingly important.

The developed control scheme makes use of a two-layer neural network to learn the behaviors of unknown dynamics of robot. Both the estimation error and external disturbances can be effectively counteracted by employing smooth robust compensators. It is proved that arbitrarily small tracking errors could be achieved by selecting proper design parameters. In the control method derived here, there is no preliminary off-line learning phase, which is time-consuming, for better estimation of unknown nonlinear smooth function. The input weights are chosen randomly in and they are fixed in the whole simulation, and the adjustable output weights of neural network are simply initialized to be zero. The weight tuning algorithm for tunable parameters guarantees both closed loop stability and bounded weights. In the simulation, besides MATLAB, a famous multi-body dynamics analysis software in the world called ADAMS is employed. The combined simulation of ADAMS and MATLAB is able to produce realistic results of the closed loop system behaviors. The co-simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565260/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11524891","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565260/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network control of a 5 DOF robot manipulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network control of a 5 DOF robot manipulator","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067306S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557901","isNumber":"5564160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557901","xplore-issue":"5564160","articleId":"5565260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5565270,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonghua Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zhonghua","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401357500"},{"name":"Yinlin Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yinlin","lastName":"Li","id":"37066648800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7050-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7047-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7049-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565270","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565270","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loading","Array signal processing","Interference","Antennas","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Object detection","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuze antenna beamforming","radio fuze","linearly contrained minimum viariance","LCMV criterion","fuze-warhead efficiency","fuze anti-interference ability","beam pattern","fuze target detection capability","antenna beamform pattern","optimization effect","former sidelobe suppression","wide nulling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5565270","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557901/5564160/05565270.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5565270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5564160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimazition and simulation of the fuze antenna beamforming algorithm based on LCMV criterion","abstract":"Beamforming technology is one of the key technologies of radio fuze, which can improve the fuze-warhead efficiency and the fuze anti-interference ability.

Finally, The experiments with complex and Multi-dimensional functions demonstrate that STMACPSO outperforms the original CPSO in the global searching ability and convergence rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5565312","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557901/5564160/05565312.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"321","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Control and Information Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICIP.2010.5565312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5564160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of adaptive chaos embedded particle swarm optimization algorithm based on Skew Tent map","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Study of adaptive chaos embedded particle swarm optimization algorithm based on Skew Tent map","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11525028","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5565312/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of adaptive chaos embedded particle swarm optimization algorithm based on Skew Tent map","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058687S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557901","isNumber":"5564160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557901","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5564160","articleId":"5565312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5565346,"authors":[{"name":"Jungho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/5556433/5565346/5565346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jungho Kim (M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2006.","He is currently with the Department of Information Display, Kyung Hee University, Seoul.

We establish 1088 coupled rate equations to simulate the carrier dynamics of the inhomogeneously broadened QD ensembles as inhomogeneous broadening increases. When all the QD ensembles are identical and inhomogeneous broadening becomes zero, eight coupled rate equations are solved for the homogeneous QDs. The gain and phase recovery responses are calculated when an ultrashort pump pulse is injected into a QD SOA. As the inhomogeneous broadening increases, the slow component of the phase recovery at the QD ground state increases due to the enlarged contribution from the slow phase recovery of carrier reservoirs such as the QD excited states. By separately calculating the gain and phase recovery responses of the homogeneous QDs with different sizes, we identify how increasing inhomogeneous broadening affects the enlarged slow phase recovery components from carrier reservoirs. We also demonstrate that the effect of inhomogeneous broadening on the temporal variation of the \u03b1-factor is more significant compared to the injection pump power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5565346/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11513314","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Inhomogeneous Broadening on Gain and Phase Recovery of Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Inhomogeneous Broadening on Gain and Phase Recovery of Quantum-Dot Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"jqe-kim-2058793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137138S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"5556433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5556433","articleId":"5565346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5565348,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Materials Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma, Nara, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/5556433/5565348/5565348-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Sakaguchi (M'10) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1998, 2000, and 2003, respectively.

A power amplifier (PA) is developed based on the concept of pulsed load modulation (PLM) that can enhance the power efficiency of the PA when the output power is back off from the peak due to modulations. The PLM technique utilizes the time-varying behavior of switched resonators to form an optimal, power dependent load impedance. The switched resonator consists of a balanced pair of switching mode PAs that drive a high-Q bandpass filter. In addition to its efficiency enhancement through PLM, the PA is able to preserve the linearity of complex modulations through the architecture of envelope delta-sigma modulation (EDSM). In this paper, a 1.87 GHz PLM power amplifier is fabricated with a pair of 0.35 \u03bcm GaAs pHEMT devices. The duty cycle tests show its significant improvement on power efficiency at different back-off levels over traditional Class-B amplifiers. The PA module is also tested with a single-channel WCDMA signal with peak to average ratio (PAR) of 10.8 dB. It has achieved 39 dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) at 5 MHz offsets without needing additional linearization techniques. The power added efficiency in this case is 43% including the loss of the output filter and 52.6% if the loss of the filter is de-embedded.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2057931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5584926/05565376.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2057931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584926","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Efficiency WCDMA Power Amplifier With Pulsed Load Modulation (PLM)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Efficiency WCDMA Power Amplifier With Pulsed Load Modulation (PLM)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11535251","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5565376/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Efficiency WCDMA Power Amplifier With Pulsed Load Modulation (PLM)","sourcePdf":"jssc-liao-2057931-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089181S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5584926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5584926","articleId":"5565376","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5565380,"authors":[{"name":"Ki Young Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"37634606500"},{"name":"Woo Young Kim","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo Young","lastName":"Kim","id":"37632863700"},{"name":"Chul Soon Park","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chul Soon","lastName":"Park","id":"37277788500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5565380","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":634},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter demonstrates a high-dynamic range GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor Class E power amplifier (PA) for a WCDMA envelope elimination and restoration transmitter using a dual-mode amplification.

It consists of a driven dipole element with two varactors in two arms, a director with an additional varactor, a truncated ground plane reflector, a microstrip-to-coplanar-stripline (CPS) transition, and a novel biasing circuit. The effective electrical length of the director element and that of the driven arms are adjusted together by changing the biasing voltages. A 35% continuously frequency-tuning bandwidth, from 1.80 to 2.45 GHz, is achieved. This covers a number of wireless communication systems, including 3G UMTS, US WCS, and WLAN.

Measured results show that the gain varies from 5.6 to 7.6 dBi and the front-to-back ratio is better than 10 dB.

The new unit cell consists of two complementary SRR inclusions connected by an additional slot. This modification improves the rejection response in terms of bandwidth and suppression. The filtering characteristics of the band-gap structure are investigated using dispersion analysis. Using the new structure, it was possible to achieve a 10-dB reduction in the mutual coupling between two patch antennas with a separation of only 1/4 free-space wavelength between them. Since the proposed structures are broadband, they can be used to minimize coupling and co-channel interference in multiband antennas.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2010.2074175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5423326/05565383.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2010.2074175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling Reduction Between Microstrip Patch Antennas Using Slotted-Complementary Split-Ring Resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565383/","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling Reduction Between Microstrip Patch Antennas Using Slotted-Complementary Split-Ring Resonators","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2010","accessionNumber":"11556610","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565383/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling Reduction Between Microstrip Patch Antennas Using Slotted-Complementary Split-Ring Resonators","sourcePdf":"lawp-ramahi-2074175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040816S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5423326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"5423326","articleId":"5565383","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5565400,"authors":[{"name":"Han Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5580237/5565400/5565400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Han Yu received the B.Eng. degree in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2007, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the School of Computer Engineering.","He is a Singapore Millennium Foundation (SMF) Ph.D. scholar.

In this paper, we examine the latest methods which have been proposed by researchers to manage trust and reputation in wireless communication systems. Specifically, we survey the state of the art in the application of trust models in the fields of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and cognitive radio networks (CRNs). We classify the mainstream methods into natural categories and illustrate how they complement each other in achieving design goals.

The proposed technique can be used along transmission links with simple low-cost hardware and/or in digital signal processing (DSP)-based coherent receivers without additional hardware, thus enabling next-generation optical networks using higher order modulation formats to achieve transmission rates of 100 Gb/s per channel and beyond.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565409/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5565409/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11597225","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"22","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"OSNR Monitoring for Higher Order Modulation Formats Using Asynchronous Amplitude Histogram","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OSNR Monitoring for Higher Order Modulation Formats Using Asynchronous Amplitude Histogram","sourcePdf":"lpt-shen-2073699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033406S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5607254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5607254","articleId":"5565409","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5565410,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Kai Xu","affiliation":["Beijing GeoScience Center, Schlumberger Limited, CFINS, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5765512/5565410/5565410-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan-Kai Xu received the doctoral degree in automatic control from the Center for Intelligent and Networked Systems (CFINS), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008.","He currently works for the Beijing GeoScience Center, Schlumberger Ltd., Beijing, China, as a Project Engineer.

In this study, the topology of a boost three-level (TL) chopper on the front of a TL diode-clamped inverter is used for direct-driven WECSs. The switch-signal phase delay control (SSPDC) is proposed for NP potential balancing of TL inverter based on the characteristics of boost TL chopper. As the boost chopper is also used for maximum power point tracking, the controller with dual PI regulators is designed for the chopper. Parameters of the two PI regulators are determined according to the state space averaging model of the boost TL chopper using SSPDC. In addition, the proposed NP balancing method is compared with two methods based on redundant vector selection. The validity of the proposed method is verified by analysis and simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Choppers","Inverters","Switches","Inductance","Capacitors","IEEE Potentials","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["choppers (circuits)","maximum power point trackers","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wind energy conversion","neutral point potential balancing","three-level inverters","voltage source converters","multilevel neutral-point","clamped converters","diode-clamped inverter","switch-signal phase delay control","NP potential balancing","maximum power point tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boost three-level (TL) chopper","direct-driven wind energy system","neutral-point (NP) potential balancing","redundant vector selection (RVS)","switch-signal phase delay control (SSPDC)","TL diode-clamped inverter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEC.2010.2060487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5714224/05565413.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5714224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2010.2060487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neutral-Point Potential Balancing of Three-Level Inverters in Direct-Driven Wind Energy Conversion System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neutral-Point Potential Balancing of Three-Level Inverters in Direct-Driven Wind Energy Conversion System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565413/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565413/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11832581","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neutral-Point Potential Balancing of Three-Level Inverters in Direct-Driven Wind Energy Conversion System","sourcePdf":"tec-xia-2060487-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108497S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5714224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5714224","articleId":"5565413","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5565415,"authors":[{"name":"Deepu Roy","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, NXP-TMSC Research Center, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Deepu","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400659400"},{"name":"Micha A.

Second, it groups the fuzzy logical relationships into fuzzy logical relationship groups (FLRGs) based on the fuzzy variations of the secondary factor. Third, it evaluates the leverage of the fuzzy variations between the main factor and the secondary factor to construct fuzzy variation groups. Fourth, it gets the statistics of the fuzzy variations appearing in each fuzzy variation group. Fifth, it calculates the weights of the statistics of the fuzzy variations appearing in each fuzzy variation group, respectively. Finally, based on the weights of the statistics of the fuzzy variations appearing in the fuzzy variation groups and the FLRGs, it performs the forecasting of the daily TAIEX. Because the proposed method uses both fuzzy variation groups and FLRGs to analyze in detail the historical training data, it gets higher forecasting accuracy rates to forecast the TAIEX than the existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2073712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2073712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705623","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5705623/05565437.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Time series analysis","Fuzzy sets","Predictive models","Training data","Accuracy","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","group theory","stock markets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TAIEX forecasting","fuzzy time series","fuzzy variation groups","Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index","fuzzy sets theory","fuzzy logical relationship groups"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy logical relationships","fuzzy sets","fuzzy time series","fuzzy variation groups","fuzzy variations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"TAIEX Forecasting Based on Fuzzy Time Series and Fuzzy Variation Groups","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565437/","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5565437/","accessionNumber":"11804863","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TAIEX Forecasting Based on Fuzzy Time Series and Fuzzy Variation Groups","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-chen-2073712-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072482S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5705623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"5705623","articleId":"5565437","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5565442,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Qiang Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5695081/5565442/5565442-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Qiang Zhao (M'05) received the B.S. degree in automation and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control theory and control engineering from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi'an, China, in 1998, 2001, and 2004, respectively.","From 2007 to 2009, he worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada and Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, respectively.

The proposed method can account for the varying data qualities and discrimination capabilities across spectral bands, and utilize the spectral and spatial information simultaneously. First, the hyperspectral data cube is partitioned into several nearly uncorrelated subsets, and an eigenvalue-based approach is proposed to evaluate the confidence of each subset. Then, a nonparametric technique is used to extract the arbitrarily-shaped clusters in spatial-spectral domain. Each cluster offers a reference spectral, based on which a pseudosupervised hyperspectral classification scheme is developed by using evidence theory to fuse the information provided by each subset. The experimental results on real Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) demonstrate that the proposed pseudosupervised classification scheme can achieve higher accuracy than the spatially constrained fuzzy c-means clustering method. It can achieve nearly the same accuracy as the supervised K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier but is more robust to noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05565442.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2059707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2059707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Band-Subset-Based Clustering and Fusion for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Feature extraction","Kernel","Correlation","Covariance matrix","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","image fusion","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band subset based clustering","image fusion","hyperspectral imagery classification","discrimination capability","eigenvalue based approach","Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment","HYDICE data","K-Nearest Neighbor classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evidence theory","hyperspectral","image segmentation","information fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Band-Subset-Based Clustering and Fusion for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification","volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5565442/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769609","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Band-Subset-Based Clustering and Fusion for Hyperspectral Imagery Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhao-2059707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073542S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5565442","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5565443,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Zhong","affiliation":["ATR National Key Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37289138300"},{"name":"Runsheng Wang","affiliation":["ATR National Key Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Runsheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280233600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"5565443","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":793},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","IEEE Potentials","Pixel","Training","Computational modeling","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image classification","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image classification algorithm","conditional random field","unified probabilistic framework","sparse high order potential","hyperspectral image characteristics","piecewise training framework","graph cut method","real-world data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","conditional random field (CRF)","contextual information","hyperspectral image","sparse higher order potentials"]}],"abstract":"Hyperspectral images exhibit strong dependencies across spatial and spectral neighbors, which have been proved to be very useful for hyperspectral image classification. The recently defined conditional random field (CRF) can effectively model and use the dependencies for classification of hyperspectral images in a unified probabilistic framework. However, in order to be computationally tractable, the usual CRFs are limited to incorporate only pairwise potentials. Thus, the usual CRFs can capture only pairwise interactions and neglect higher order dependencies, which are potentially useful high-level properties particularly for the classification of hyperspectral image consisting of complex components. This paper overcomes this limitation by developing hyperspectral image classification algorithm based on a CRF with sparse higher order potentials, which are specially designed to incorporate complex characteristics of hyperspectral images. To efficiently implement the CRF model at training step, this paper develops an efficient local method under the piecewise training framework, while at inference step, this proposes a simple strategy to combine the piecewisely trained model to overcome the possible over-counting problems. Moreover, the combined model with the specially defined potentials can be efficiently inferred by graph cut method. Experiments on the real-world data attest to the accuracy, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed model on modeling and classifying hyperspectral images.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2059706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05565443.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2059706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","startPage":"688","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Classifying Hyperspectral Imagery by CRFs With Sparse Higher Order Potentials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Classifying Hyperspectral Imagery by CRFs With Sparse Higher Order Potentials","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565443/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769610","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Classifying Hyperspectral Imagery by CRFs With Sparse Higher Order Potentials","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhong-2059706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057546S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"48","articleId":"5565443","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5565444,"authors":[{"name":"Dusan S.

Two bias-avoiding schemes produce unbiased estimates of the polarimetric backscattering covariance matrix which are then combined into bias-free polarimetric variables. One concerns full polarimetric measurements and calls for adjusting the amplitudes and phases of the array elements so that the transmitted field equals that generated by a mechanically steered polarimetric weather radar antenna; this is followed by an additional adjustment of the received fields. The second scheme is also applicable to full polarimetric measurements but involves adjustments only of the received fields. Crucial to both schemes is decoupling of the Doppler effects from the terms of the covariance matrix. It is a significant part of the bias issue that had not been previously addressed. A scheme to reduce bias applicable to nondepolarizing media (i.e., diagonal backscattering matrix) is also addressed; it calls for multiplication of the fields received by each dipole as opposed to a combination of multiplication and addition required for full correction. The schemes are applied to the alternate transmission and simultaneous reception polarimetric mode and the simultaneous transmission and simultaneous reception mode.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05565444.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2057436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2057436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bias Correction and Doppler Measurement for Polarimetric Phased-Array Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Doppler effect","Radar polarimetry","Scattering","Backscatter","Doppler radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler measurement","radar polarimetry","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bias correction","Doppler measurement","polarimetric phased array radar","bias avoiding scheme","polarimetric backscattering covariance matrix","polarimetric weather radar antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bias in polarimetric variables","Doppler measurement","phased-array weather radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Bias Correction and Doppler Measurement for Polarimetric Phased-Array Radar","volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5565444/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769611","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bias Correction and Doppler Measurement for Polarimetric Phased-Array Radar","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zrnic-2057436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066258S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5565444","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5565459,"authors":[{"name":"Donglin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5609237/5565459/5565459-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Donglin Wang (S'09) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees from the School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Xi\u00e1n Jiaotong University, Xi\u00e1n, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Room reverberation parameters depend on the location of the speaker and the microphone and the room geometry. For mobile robots, the reverberation is constantly changing due to the relative movement of the speaker and the robot. This can affect the spectral properties of the signal and therefore, the classification accuracy. The contribution of this paper is a new network architecture, which uses neural network constant modulus algorithm (NNCMA) based equalizer followed by a multi-layer preceptron (MLP) classifier. NNCMA is an MLP which is trained with a cost function similar to constant modulus algorithm (CMA). With this two-stage structure, the classifier does not have to consider the time-varying nature of the reverberation. The proposed algorithm is applied to speech samples collected by the home service robot WEVER-R2 for speaker classification in a typical home or office environment. We use them for gender classification application. The proposed neural network was found to have 83.73% of classification accuracy for age classification and 88.91% of classification accuracy for gender classification, while the standard MLP had a classification accuracy of 71.43% and 72.29%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565459/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","volume":"59","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"11629848","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565459/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Deconvolutive Neural Network for Speech Classification With Applications to Home Service Robot","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deconvolutive Neural Network for Speech Classification With Applications to Home Service Robot","sourcePdf":"tim-kurian-2047551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081345S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5609237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5609237","articleId":"5565459","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5565464,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Ching Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rong-Ching","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292107500"},{"name":"Ching-Tai Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Pingtung Institute of Commerce, Ping Tung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Tai","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37065066500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"5565464","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"abstract":"In this paper, exponential signals in the frequency domain are accurately analyzed by an algorithm, and the peaks of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) result are adopted to obtain parameters that include amplitudes, frequencies, dampings, and phases.

By using transient excitatory self-interactions of neurons and sigmoidal nonlinearities, we develop an approach to investigate multiperiodicity and attractivity of periodically oscillated DTNNs with time-varying and distributed delays.

An ET transmitter consists of a linear RF power amplifier and a high-efficiency envelope amplifier, which is always a switched-mode power converter. The envelope amplifier provides a varying drain (collector) bias voltage, which tracks the envelope of the RF input signal, for the RF power amplifier. Thus, the RF power amplifier keeps working in high-efficiency region of most of the time. Therefore, the overall efficiency of the transmitter is increased. This paper proposes a multistage noise-shaping-technique-controlled multilevel power converter to perform as the envelope amplifier in an ET transmitter. Experimental results show that the proposed power converter can reproduce any envelope signals with the maximum spectrum component of 300 kHz and give maximum instantaneous power of 20 W. Compared with pulsewidth modulation, the noise-shaping technique can shape the ripple into noise and the noise will be attenuated by the low-pass filter, which results a better performance, while maintaining high efficiency as well.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-stage noise shaping","Modulation","Converters","Radio frequency","Power amplifiers","Transmitters","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","low-pass filters","power amplifiers","power convertors","radio transmitters","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MASH controlled multilevel power converter","RF transmitter","envelope tracking transmitter","wireless communication system","switched-mode power converter","envelope amplifier","drain bias voltage","multistage noise shaping technique","envelope signal","spectrum component","instantaneous power","low-pass filter","linear RF power amplifier","frequency 300 kHz","power 20 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Envelope tracking (ET)","multilevel converter","multistage noise shaping (MASH)","switched-mode power converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2073721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5871429/05565484.pdf","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2073721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A MASH-Controlled Multilevel Power Converter for High-Efficiency RF Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A MASH-Controlled Multilevel Power Converter for High-Efficiency RF Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565484/","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565484/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12047678","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MASH-Controlled Multilevel Power Converter for High-Efficiency RF Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tpel-huang-2073721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070199S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5871429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5871429","articleId":"5565484","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5565492,"authors":[{"name":"Luiz Antonio de Souza Ribeiro","affiliation":["Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o, Sao Luis, MA, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/5667077/5565492/5565492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luiz Antonio de Souza Ribeiro received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Federal University of Paraiba, Campina Grande, Brazil, in 1995 and 1998, respectively.","From 2004 to 2006, he was a Visiting Researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, working in sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous machines.

Out of these, a significant number of villages may never be connected to the national grid due to their remoteness. For the people living in these communities, access to renewable energy sources is the only solution to meet their energy needs. In these communes, the electricity is mainly used for household purposes such as lighting. There is little scope for the productive use of energy. It is recognized that electric service contributes particularly to inclusive social development and to a lesser extent to pro-poor growth as well as to environmental sustainability. In this paper, we present the specification, design, and development of a standalone micro-grid supplied by a hybrid wind-solar generating source. The goal of the project was to provide a reliable, continuous, sustainable, and good-quality electricity service to users, as provided in bigger cities. As a consequence, several technical challenges arose and were overcome successfully as will be related in this paper, contributing to increase of confidence in renewable systems to isolated applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165391/5667077/05565492.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2010.2073723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2010.2073723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5667077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isolated Micro-Grids With Renewable Hybrid Generation: The Case of Len\u00e7\u00f3is Island","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Batteries","Communities","Hybrid power systems","Temperature measurement","Wind turbines","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power grids","solar power stations","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolated microgrids","renewable hybrid generation","Len\u00e7\u00f3is island","electricity grid","renewable energy sources","lighting","environmental sustainability","hybrid wind-solar generating source"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid energy systems","solar energy","standalone micro-grids","wind energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Isolated Micro-Grids With Renewable Hybrid Generation: The Case of Len\u00e7\u00f3is Island","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5565492/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11693260","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolated Micro-Grids With Renewable Hybrid Generation: The Case of Len\u00e7\u00f3is Island","sourcePdf":"tste-saavedra-2073723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103696S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"5667077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5667077","articleId":"5565492","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5565494,"authors":[{"name":"Piergiorgio Alotto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Piergiorgio","lastName":"Alotto","id":"37297374600"},{"name":"Massimo Barcaro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Barcaro","id":"37401730500"},{"name":"Nicola Bianchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Bianchi","id":"37278301300"},{"name":"Massimo Guarnieri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padua, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Guarnieri","id":"37297375500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5565494","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2043},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Harmonic analysis","Reluctance motors","Windings","Rotors","Permanent magnet motors","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine windings","optimisation","permanent magnet motors","reluctance motors","rotors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent magnet motors","torque ripple","Machaon rotor flux barriers","winding arrangements","optimization technique","Machaon structure","PM volume","PM assisted synchronous reluctance motor","torque average value"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machaon","optimization","proper interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor","torque ripple"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565494","abstract":"Interior permanent magnet (IPM) motors are normally designed with two or more flux barriers per pole.

When a dedicated control channel is unavailable, a control channel must be dynamically allocated in licensed channels and vacated for the presence of primary users (PUs). As a result, the establishment of such a control channel is a challenge. In this paper, an efficient recovery control channel (ERCC) design is proposed to address this challenge. This heuristic and distributed design approach is essentially based on the observed spectrum homogeneity in a neighborhood. By adaptively updating a list of channels commonly available to neighbors, each secondary user is able to efficiently establish new control channels among neighbors in response to PU activity changes. Therefore, a virtually \u201calways on\u201d control channel robust to PU activity can be realized by the proposed method. The contributions are summarized as follows: 1) The proposed method efficiently recovers control channels from PU activity changes and maintains network connectivity. 2) It extends the control channel coverage to facilitate broadcast and reduce control overhead and delay. 3) It minimizes the interference with PUs. Simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms the classic group- and sequence-based solutions in the responsiveness to rapidly changing PU activity and the maintenance of connectivity. Furthermore, the increase in control channel coverage and the allocation of the highest quality channels to control channels can be well balanced with reliability and scalability in various network scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2073725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05565513.pdf","startPage":"4513","endPage":"4526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2073725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Recovery Control Channel Design in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565513/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Recovery Control Channel Design in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630028","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565513/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Recovery Control Channel Design in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lo-2073725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077848S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5565513","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5565523,"authors":[{"name":"Chengzong Pang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5570058/5565523/5565523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengzong Pang (S'07) received the B.S and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from North China Electric Power University, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at Texas A&M University, College Station.","His research interests are power system analysis, protection, and stability and control."]},"firstName":"Chengzong","lastName":"Pang","id":"37398917900"},{"name":"Mladen Kezunovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5570058/5565523/5565523-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Mladen Kezunovic (S'77\u2013M'80\u2013SM'85\u2013F'99) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Sarajevo in 1974 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Kansas in 1977 and 1980, respectively.","Currently, he is the Eugene E.

Simulated transients were used to train and test the classifiers offline. The wavelet energies calculated using three-phase currents were used as input features for the classifiers. The results of the study showed the potential for developing a highly reliable transient classification system using the PNN technique. An online classification model for PNN was fully implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC. This model was extensively tested under different scenarios. The effects of the fault impedance, signal noise, current-transformer saturation, and arcing faults were investigated.

A phase-disposition (PD) sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) strategy, including a voltage balancing method, for the operation of an MMC is presented in this paper. Based on the proposed PD-SPWM switching strategy, a mathematical model for the MMC-HVDC system, under both balanced and unbalanced grid operation modes, is developed. Dynamic performance of the MMC-based back-to-back HVDC converter system, based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment, is then evaluated. The reported time-domain simulation results show that based on the adopted PD-SPWM switching strategy, the MMC-HVDC station can respond satisfactorily to the system dynamics and control commands under balanced and unbalanced conditions while maintaining voltage balance of the dc capacitors.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2050787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2050787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05565526.pdf","startPage":"2903","endPage":"2912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Performance of a Modular Multilevel Back-to-Back HVDC System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Performance of a Modular Multilevel Back-to-Back HVDC System","volume":"25","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565526/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534259","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Performance of a Modular Multilevel Back-to-Back HVDC System","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-msaeedifard-2050787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081994S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"880","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5565526","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5565529,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel A.

The integration of large shares of wind generation in power systems led to the development of new forecasting methodologies, including probabilistic forecasting tools, but management tools able to use those forecasts to help making operational decisions are still needed. In this paper, a risk evaluation perspective is used, showing that it is possible to describe the consequences of each possible reserve level through a set of risk indices useful for decision making. The new reserve management tool (RMT) described in the paper is intended to support the SO in defining the operating reserve needs for the daily and intraday markets. Decision strategies like setting an acceptable risk level or finding a compromise between economic issues and the risk of loss of load are explored. An illustrative example based on the Portuguese power system demonstrates the usefulness and efficiency of the tool.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Setting the Operating Reserve Using Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasts","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2065818","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5753358/05565529.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2065818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565529/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Setting the Operating Reserve Using Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasts","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5565529/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11961081","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Setting the Operating Reserve Using Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasts","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-bessa-2065818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063088S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5753358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"5753358","articleId":"5565529","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5565530,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In both cases, the efficiency can be accurately obtained using the \u201cHill diagram\u201d supplied by turbine manufacturers. A multiple nonlinear regression analysis of the unit's technical efficiency is estimated as a quadratic function of net head and water discharge.

A dynamic model is developed to analyze the induction generator effect (IGE) and torsional interaction (TI) in such systems. A test system derived from the IEEE first benchmark model is considered for the analysis. The effect of two factors namely: 1) series compensation level and 2) wind speed on the IGE and TI are studied. In addition, impact of the inner current converter controller parameters and turbine parameters on SSR is also addressed. Small signal (eigenvalue) analysis is conducted to assess the damping of network and torsional modes followed by dynamic (time domain) simulations. The major contribution of this paper is the analytical investigation on SSR phenomena presented in DFIG-based wind farms interconnected with series compensated networks.

When a new application starts, the proposed NoC tailors its topology to the application traffic pattern by changing the inter-router connections to some predefined configuration corresponding to the application. It addresses one of the main drawbacks of the existing application-specific NoC optimization methods, i.e., optimization of NoCs based on the traffic pattern of a single application. Supporting multiple applications is a critical feature of an NoC when several different applications are integrated into a single modern and complex multicore system-on-chip or chip multiprocessor. The proposed reconfigurable NoC architecture supports multiple applications by appropriately configuring itself to a topology that matches the traffic pattern of the currently running application. This paper first introduces the proposed reconfigurable topology and then addresses the problems of core to network mapping and topology exploration. Further on, we evaluate the impact of different architectural attributes on the performance of the proposed NoC. Evaluations consider network latency, power consumption, and area complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2066586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6017244/05565545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2066586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017244","startPage":"2010","endPage":"2022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-Aware Topology Reconfiguration for On-Chip Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application-Aware Topology Reconfiguration for On-Chip Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12228012","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5565545/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Aware Topology Reconfiguration for On-Chip Networks","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-sarbaziazad-2066586-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160005S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6017244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6017244","articleId":"5565545","onlineDate":"07 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5565614,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The different training algorithms are compared in terms of estimation error (mean absolute error and standard deviation of error) and training performance (training time and number of training iterations to reach the optimal weights). The NN-based approach is also compared with the conventional maximum amplitude algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SOFA.2010.5565614","startPage":"119","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"4th International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFA.2010.5565614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5565579","displayPublicationTitle":"4th International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550961/5565579/05565614.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Feed-Forward Neural Network training algorithms for oscillometric blood pressure estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565614/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Feed-Forward Neural Network training algorithms for oscillometric blood pressure estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5565614/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11516908","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Feed-Forward Neural Network training algorithms for oscillometric blood pressure estimation","confLoc":"Arad, Romania","sourcePdf":"20VoicuGroza.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062683S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550961","isNumber":"5565579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550961","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5565579","articleId":"5565614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5565623,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The constructed fuzzy neural network has six inputs and two outputs. The six inputs are the obstacle distance information detected by the five sonar sensors installed on the robot and the target point relative to the robot orientation information; Obstacle information obtained from the five sensors is integrated into the obstacle distance information in three directions of the left, the front and the right by the second and third layer of Fuzzy neural network. Outputs of the network are the robot's speed and angle to run the next step. The inputs of the five obstacles are measured by the sonar sensors in real time. Target points in the sampling time relative to the direction and position of the robot can be calculated by the location of the robot and the target point in the world coordinate system. Computer simulation shows that by robot's own perception of the environment, through the constant interaction with the environment by learning to repeatedly adjust the environment and its own model, robot can run without collision in unknown environment.

Stereo matching is extended and applied to color in addition to grayscale, which improves matching in a low texture image like parts of the skin of a human face.

Simulation results show that the proposed antenna has an impedance bandwidth (VSWR<;1.5) of about 480 MHz (1700-2013;2180 MHz), a cross polarization level of less than -2212;20dB and a gain level of about 8 dBi or larger within the operating bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/INDUSIS.2010.5565905","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559274/5565782/05565905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDUSIS.2010.5565905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5565782","startPage":"90","endPage":"93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A broadband single-patch antenna with low cross polarization for GSM/CDMA repeater and base stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A broadband single-patch antenna with low cross polarization for GSM/CDMA repeater and base stations","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5565905/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 July 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11520969","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5565905/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broadband single-patch antenna with low cross polarization for GSM/CDMA repeater and base stations","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044745S","chronDate":"10-11 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559274","isNumber":"5565782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559274","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5565782","articleId":"5565905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5565946,"authors":[{"name":"You-wu Xu","affiliation":["Inst. of Technol., UGS Coll. of Yancheng, Yancheng, China"],"firstName":"You-wu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087853694"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6641-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6640-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5565946","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Signal processing algorithms","Fading","Matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","immune genetic algorithm","antigen","antibody","evolutionary strategy","computer simulation","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","Improved Immune-genetic Algorithm","multiuser detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5565946","abstract":"In order to deal with the shortcoming of conventional optimal multiuser detection methods,this paper reports a novel multiuser detection algorithm based on improved immune-genetic algorithm which regards objective function as antigen, solution as antibody and updates the population using evolutionary strategy.

The proposed algorithm has smaller mean square error and faster convergence rate comparison with the spatial diversity equalizer based on CMA (SDE-CMA) and fractionally spaced spatial diversity equalizer based on CMA (FS-SDE-CMA).

Vibration signals are collected on a diesel engine test platform. Wavelet packet analysis (WPA) coefficients of vibration signals are used for evaluating their Shannon entropy and treated as the features to identify the fault conditions of diesel engine in the preprocessing. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to classify the fault condition. To improve the convergence of BPNN, a hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a differential operator named PSO-DV is used to adjust the weights and threshold of BPNN in fault diagnosis of diesel engine. To verify the proposed PSO-DV hybrid method has the better convergence, a classical PSO based BPNN is compared with a PSO-DV based BPNN in fault classification of diesel engine. The experimental results showed the proposed hybrid intelligent PSO-DV method not only achieved classification for diesel engine, but also can escape from local optima, so has better convergence than classical PSO.","doi":"10.1109/ICICCI.2010.17","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Cognitive

This paper brings a new idea for the positioning of nodes in a wireless sensor network. The sensors communicate with each other to transmit their data to a high energy communication node which acts as an interface between data processing unit and sensors. Optimization of sensor locations is essential to provide communication for a longer duration. An energy efficient layout with good coverage based on Genetic algorithm is proposed here. During the process of optimization, sensors move to form a uniformly distributed network. The two objectives taken into consideration are coverage and lifetime. Basically a set of network layouts are obtained. The simulation results also exhibit improvement of performance with increase in number of generations in the algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5566047/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11520274","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5566047/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","conferenceDate":"22-23 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm for Energy Efficient and Coverage-Preserved Positioning in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm for Energy Efficient and Coverage-Preserved Positioning in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"4014a022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043491S","chronDate":"22-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5565553","isNumber":"5565931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5565553","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5565931","articleId":"5566047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5566290,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.

True hybridization can be accomplished when both channels collaboratively compensate the shortcomings of each other and thereby improve the performance of the system as a whole. In this paper, we propose a novel coding paradigm called \"Hybrid Channel Coding\" that not only optimally achieves the capacity of the combined FSO and RF channels but also can potentially provide carrier grade reliability (99.999%) for hybrid FSO/RF systems. The proposed mechanism uses non-uniform and rate-compatible LDPC codes to achieve the desired reliability and capacity limits. We propose a design methodology for constructing these Hybrid Channel Codes. Using analysis and simulation, we show that by using Hybrid Channel Codes, we can obtain significantly better availability results in terms of the required link margin while the average throughput obtained is more than 33% better than the currently existing systems. Also by avoiding data duplication, we preserve to a great extent the crucial security benefits of FSO communications. Simulations also show that Hybrid Channel Codes can achieve more than two orders of magnitude improvement in bit error rate compared to present systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567007/","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5567007/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11588273","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Channel Codes for Efficient FSO/RF Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Channel Codes for Efficient FSO/RF Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"TCOM-09-0195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092213S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5567007","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5567012,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Kai","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280263500"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"},{"name":"Jung-Chieh Chen","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectronics and Communications Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Chieh","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280673400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5567012","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":530},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Detectors","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna accessories","decoding","error correction codes","error statistics","multi-access systems","Rician channels","statistical analysis","telecommunication signalling","transceivers","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic mutual information","Rician MIMO-MA channels","replica method","statistical physics","correlated Rician multiple-input multiple-output multiple-access channel","MIMO MA channel","signaling input distributions","joint optimum decoding","JOD","central receiver","asymptotic characteristics","separate detection and decoding","SDD","spatial detection","temporal error-correction decoder","performance metrics","error probability","antenna elements","transceivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotic analysis","MIMO","multiple access","mutual information","replica method","Rician channels"]}],"abstract":"Using the replica method, originally developed in statistical physics, we derive the asymptotic mutual information (MI) of a spatially correlated Rician multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple-access (MA) channel for any given signaling input distributions (not necessarily Gaussian) in the large-system regime where the numbers of antennas at the transmitters and the receiver go to infinity with a constant ratio.

Among other features, OFDM has been able to successfully exploit channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, allowing to implement dynamic resource allocation schemes that improve spectral efficiency and error resilience. Nevertheless, in most wireless communication systems achieving a perfect CSI at the transmitter is difficult. For this reason a limited-rate feedback mode has been proposed, in which only quantized CSI at the transmitter is available. In this paper we design joint channel quantization and resource allocation schemes for single-user OFDM systems, that use limited-rate feedback and do not assume any structure on the channel quantizer. The new schemes are obtained by solving an optimization problem that maximizes average ergodic rate subject to average power and bit error rate constraints. Necessary optimality conditions for the quantization and resource allocation schemes are derived and algorithms to find a solution satisfying such conditions are discussed. Since finding the overall global optimal solution is computationally cumbersome, suboptimal yet simple schemes are also explored. Three simplifications are investigated, namely: a worst-case robust design that reduces the dimensionality of the problem; optimal and provably convergent stochastic schemes that catch the average behavior of the system on-the-fly; and schemes that reduce the amount of feedback required from the receiver by exploiting the channel correlation among subcarriers. The signalling and computational costs associated to the implementation of the developed schemes and their extension to multiple user systems are also discussed. Numerical examples corroborate analytical claims and reveal that significant gains result even when suboptimal schemes based on affordable limited-rate feedback are used.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05567017.pdf","startPage":"3130","endPage":"3143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.082710.091328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.082710.091328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Average Performance of OFDM Systems Using Limited-Rate Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Transmitters","Loading","Quantization","Optimization","Bit error rate","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","correlation methods","error statistics","feedback","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiocommunication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimizing average performance","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","wireless communication systems","channel state information","CSI","radio transmitter","dynamic resource allocation schemes","spectral efficiency","error resilience","limited-rate feedback mode","joint channel quantization","single-user OFDM systems","channel quantizer","optimization problem","ergodic rate","bit error rate constraints","necessary optimality conditions","radio receiver","channel correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","optimization methods","stochastic optimization","limited-rate feedback","resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Average Performance of OFDM Systems Using Limited-Rate Feedback","volume":"9","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5567017/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574440","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Average Performance of OFDM Systems Using Limited-Rate Feedback","sourcePdf":"3130-tw1010-marques.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13132S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5567017","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5567084,"authors":[{"name":"Weiwei Cui","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Weiwei Cui is a PhD candidate in computer science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Automated web-based negotiation of Service Level Agreements (SLA) can help define the QoS requirements of critical service-based processes. We propose a novel trusted Negotiation Broker (NB) framework that performs adaptive and intelligent bilateral bargaining of SLAs between a service provider and a service consumer based on each party's high-level business requirements. We define mathematical models to map business-level requirements to low-level parameters of the decision function, which obscures the complexity of the system from the parties. We also define an algorithm for adapting the decision functions during an ongoing negotiation to comply with an opponent's offers or with updated consumer preferences. The NB uses intelligent agents to conduct the negotiation locally by selecting the most appropriate time-based decision functions. The negotiation outcomes are validated by extensive experimental study for Exponential, Polynomial, and Sigmoid time-based decision functions using simulations on our prototype framework. Results are compared in terms of a total utility value of the negotiating parties to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive and Intelligent SLA Negotiation System for Web Services","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2010.44","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/5723065/05567093.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2010.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5723065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive and Intelligent SLA Negotiation System for Web Services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5567093/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2011","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2011","accessionNumber":"11860958","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive and Intelligent SLA Negotiation System for Web Services","sourcePdf":"tsc2011010031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070256S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"5723065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5723065","articleId":"5567093","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5567094,"authors":[{"name":"Lianzhang Zhu","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Dongying, Shandong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/5659504/5567094/5567094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lianzhang Zhu received the BS degree in applied mathematics from the China University of Petroleum (East China), Dongying, in 1986, and the MS degree in computer architecture from the Shenyang Computing Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1989.

Currently, the first issue is not addressed and the second one is dealt with subjectively. Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a quality management system, has found its success in improving quality of complex products although it has not been used for developing web service systems. In this paper, we analyze requirements for web services and their design attributes, and apply the QFD for developing web service systems by linking quality of service requirements to web service design attributes. A new method for technical target setting in QFD, based on an artificial neural network, is also presented. Compared with the conventional methods for technical target setting in QFD, such as benchmarking and the linear regression method, which fail to incorporate nonlinear relationships between design attributes and quality of service requirements, it sets up technical targets consistent with relationships between quality of web service requirements and design attributes, no matter whether they are linear or nonlinear.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11684859","volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5567094/","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Technical Target Setting in QFD for Web Service Systems Using an Artificial Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technical Target Setting in QFD for Web Service Systems Using an Artificial Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tsc2010040338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079885S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"5659504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5659504","articleId":"5567094","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5567095,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406463900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-1374"},{"format":"CD","value":"2372-0204"}],"articleNumber":"5567095","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1233},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Probabilistic logic","Mobile communication","Uncertainty","Mobile ad hoc networks","Availability","Service oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile ad hoc networks","mobile computing","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility prediction","dependable service composition","wireless mobile ad hoc networks","service-oriented architecture","probability-free model","probabilistic model","service composition solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)","service composition","wireless mobile ad hoc network."]}],"abstract":"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is emerging as the next inevitable technology for application developments. One fundamental issue of SOA is service composition, i.e., to seamlessly compose distributed services into more complex applications. In the mobile environment, a service composition may face disruptions caused by the movement of both users and service providers. Thus, a dependable service composition is desired to handle the mobility in the environment. In this paper, we propose to achieve dependable service composition by taking the mobility prediction of the service providers into consideration. We exploit the fact that the service providers can predict their stay time in the current environment. However, some uncertainty may exist in the prediction such that a service provider may move out of the current environment earlier than the prediction. We use two models to characterize the uncertainty, a probability-free model and a probabilistic model. Our objective is to design dependable service composition under these two models such that the service composition solution can have the maximum tolerance to the uncertainty of the mobility prediction. We focus on the case of sequential service composition, prove the NP-hardness of the problem, then present heuristic algorithms, derive the upper and lower bounds of the problem. Simulation results have showcased the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2010.46","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/5723065/05567095.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2010.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5723065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Mobility Prediction for Dependable Service Composition in Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567095/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Mobility Prediction for Dependable Service Composition in Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2011","accessionNumber":"11860959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Mobility Prediction for Dependable Service Composition in Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tsc2011010044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041152S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2011","isNumber":"5723065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"42","articleId":"5567095","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5567101,"authors":[{"name":"Danushka Bollegala","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5753264/5567101/5567101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Danushka Bollegala received the BS, MS and the PhD degrees from the University of Tokyo, Japan, in 2005, 2007, and 2009.

Accurate identification of aliases of a given person name is useful in various web related tasks such as information retrieval, sentiment analysis, personal name disambiguation, and relation extraction. We propose a method to extract aliases of a given personal name from the web. Given a personal name, the proposed method first extracts a set of candidate aliases. Second, we rank the extracted candidates according to the likelihood of a candidate being a correct alias of the given name. We propose a novel, automatically extracted lexical pattern-based approach to efficiently extract a large set of candidate aliases from snippets retrieved from a web search engine. We define numerous ranking scores to evaluate candidate aliases using three approaches: lexical pattern frequency, word co-occurrences in an anchor text graph, and page counts on the web. To construct a robust alias detection system, we integrate the different ranking scores into a single ranking function using ranking support vector machines. We evaluate the proposed method on three data sets: an English personal names data set, an English place names data set, and a Japanese personal names data set. The proposed method outperforms numerous baselines and previously proposed name alias extraction methods, achieving a statistically significant mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.67. Experiments carried out using location names and Japanese personal names suggest the possibility of extending the proposed method to extract aliases for different types of named entities, and for different languages. Moreover, the aliases extracted using the proposed method are successfully utilized in an information retrieval task and improve recall by 20 percent in a relation-detection task.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5753264/05567101.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Discovery of Personal Name Aliases from the Web","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Discovery of Personal Name Aliases from the Web","volume":"23","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11961123","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567101/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Discovery of Personal Name Aliases from the Web","sourcePdf":"ttk2011060831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103932S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5753264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5753264","articleId":"5567101","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5567102,"authors":[{"name":"Myunggwon Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5753264/5567102/5567102-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Myunggwon Hwang received the BS degree in computer engineering, the MS degree in computer science, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from Chosun University.

WordNet has been built to be the most systematic and as close to the human level and is being applied actively in various works. In one of our previous research, we found that a semantic gap exists between concept pairs of WordNet and those of real world. This paper contains a study on the enrichment method to build a KB. We describe the methods and the results for the automatic enrichment of the semantic relation network. A rule based method using WordNet's glossaries and an inference method using axioms for WordNet relations are applied for the enrichment and an enriched WordNet (E-WordNet) is built as the result. Our experimental results substantiate the usefulness of E-WordNet. An evaluation by comparison with the human level is attempted. Moreover, WSD-SemNet, a new word sense disambiguation (WSD) method in which E-WordNet is applied, is proposed and evaluated by comparing it with the state-of-the-art algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Enrichment of Semantic Relation Network and Its Application to Word Sense Disambiguation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5753264/05567102.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753264","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Enrichment of Semantic Relation Network and Its Application to Word Sense Disambiguation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5567102/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11961124","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Enrichment of Semantic Relation Network and Its Application to Word Sense Disambiguation","sourcePdf":"ttk2011060845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0921S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5753264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5753264","articleId":"5567102","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5567103,"authors":[{"name":"Grigorios Tsoumakas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6048019/5567103/5567103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Grigorios Tsoumakas received the BSc degree in Informatics from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH) in 1999, the MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh in 2000, and the PhD degree in Informatics from AUTH in 2005.

The computational efficiency and predictive performance of LP is challenged by application domains with large number of labels and training examples. In these cases, the number of classes may become very large and at the same time many classes are associated with very few training examples. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small random subsets, called labelsets and employing LP to train a corresponding classifier. The labelsets can be either disjoint or overlapping depending on which of two strategies is used to construct them. The proposed method is called RAkEL (RAndom k labELsets), where k is a parameter that specifies the size of the subsets. Empirical evidence indicates that RAkEL manages to improve substantially over LP, especially in domains with large number of labels and exhibits competitive performance against other high-performing multilabel learning methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567103/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12302947","volume":"23","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random k-Labelsets for Multilabel Classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random k-Labelsets for Multilabel Classification","sourcePdf":"ttk2011071079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119091S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6048019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"430","xplore-issue":"6048019","articleId":"5567103","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5567104,"authors":[{"name":"Deng Cai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5753264/5567104/5567104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deng Cai received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2009.

Recently, matrix factorization-based techniques, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Concept Factorization (CF), have yielded impressive results. However, both of them effectively see only the global euclidean geometry, whereas the local manifold geometry is not fully considered. In this paper, we propose a new approach to extract the document concepts which are consistent with the manifold geometry such that each concept corresponds to a connected component. Central to our approach is a graph model which captures the local geometry of the document submanifold. Thus, we call it Locally Consistent Concept Factorization (LCCF). By using the graph Laplacian to smooth the document-to-concept mapping, LCCF can extract concepts with respect to the intrinsic manifold structure and thus documents associated with the same concept can be well clustered. The experimental results on TDT2 and Reuters-21578 have shown that the proposed approach provides a better representation and achieves better clustering results in terms of accuracy and mutual information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Geometry","Linear approximation","Laplace equations","Nearest neighbor searches","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","graph theory","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally consistent concept factorization","document clustering","matrix factorization based techniques","nonnegative matrix factorization","NMF","concept factorization","CF","manifold geometry","graph model","LCCF","graph Laplacian","document-to-concept mapping","intrinsic manifold structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonnegative matrix factorization","concept factorization","graph Laplacian","manifold regularization","clustering."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5753264/05567104.pdf","startPage":"902","endPage":"913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally Consistent Concept Factorization for Document Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Locally Consistent Concept Factorization for Document Clustering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567104/","volume":"23","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567104/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11961125","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally Consistent Concept Factorization for Document Clustering","sourcePdf":"ttk2011060902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13333S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5753264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"5753264","articleId":"5567104","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5567108,"authors":[{"name":"Kaiming He","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6047995/5567108/5567108-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaiming He received the BS degree from the Academic Talent Program, Physics Department, Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2007.

The dark channel prior is a kind of statistics of outdoor haze-free images. It is based on a key observation-most local patches in outdoor haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover a high-quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images demonstrate the power of the proposed prior. Moreover, a high-quality depth map can also be obtained as a byproduct of haze removal.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6047995/05567108.pdf","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567108/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12301542","pubMedId":"20820075","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567108/","volume":"33","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior","sourcePdf":"ttp2011122341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060076S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6047995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1829","xplore-issue":"6047995","articleId":"5567108","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":5567112,"authors":[{"name":"Jiejie Zhu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Central Florida"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5770288/5567112/5567112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiejie Zhu received the PhD degree in computer science from State Key Laboratory of CAD and CG, Zhejiang University, China, in 2007.

They provide real-time depth estimates in conditions where passive stereo does not work well, such as on white walls. In contrast, these sensors are noisy and often perform poorly on the textured scenes where stereo excels. We explore their complementary characteristics and introduce a method for combining the results from both methods that achieve better accuracy than either alone. In our fusion framework, the depth probability distribution functions from each of these sensor modalities are formulated and optimized. Robust and adaptive fusion is built on a pixel-wise reliability weighting function calculated for each method. In addition, since time-of-flight devices have primarily been used as individual sensors, they are typically poorly calibrated. We introduce a method that substantially improves upon the manufacturer's calibration. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques lead to improved accuracy and robustness on an extensive set of experimental results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5770288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5770288/05567112.pdf","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1414","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Fusion of Time-of-Flight Depth and Stereo Geometry for High Quality Depth Maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Fusion of Time-of-Flight Depth and Stereo Geometry for High Quality Depth Maps","volume":"33","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5567112/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12006989","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2011","pubMedId":"20820074","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Fusion of Time-of-Flight Depth and Stereo Geometry for High Quality Depth Maps","sourcePdf":"ttp2011071400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088203S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5770288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5770288","articleId":"5567112","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5567113,"authors":[{"name":"Di You","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"You","id":"37547391700"},{"name":"Onur C.

The idea is to use a kernel function which maps the original nonlinearly separable problem to a space of intrinsically larger dimensionality where the classes are linearly separable. A major problem in the design of kernel methods is to find the kernel parameters that make the problem linear in the mapped representation. This paper derives the first criterion that specifically aims to find a kernel representation where the Bayes classifier becomes linear. We illustrate how this result can be successfully applied in several kernel discriminant analysis algorithms. Experimental results, using a large number of databases and classifiers, demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. The paper also shows (theoretically and experimentally) that a kernel version of Subclass Discriminant Analysis yields the highest recognition rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5692151/05567113.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel Optimization in Discriminant Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Covariance matrix","Measurement","Gaussian distribution","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Training","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","computer vision","feature extraction","optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel optimization","kernel mapping","nonlinear classifiers","kernel discriminant analysis","kernel function","mapped representation","Bayes classifier","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kernel functions","kernel optimization","feature extraction","discriminant analysis","nonlinear classifiers","face recognition","object recognition","pattern recognition","machine learning."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Bayes Theorem","Computer Simulation","Databases, Factual","Discriminant Analysis","Fractals","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Models, Statistical","Nonlinear Dynamics","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Software"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Kernel Optimization in Discriminant Analysis","volume":"33","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5567113/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11759961","pubMedId":"20820072","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel Optimization in Discriminant Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttp2011030631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15394S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5692151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5692151","articleId":"5567113","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5567116,"authors":[{"name":"Yifan Hu","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Emden R.

It is fabricated using a bulk silicon microfabrication process. The actuation range is +/-16 m along both axes with a position resolution of 20 nm. The force sensor is capable of measuring forces up to +/-60 N with a resolution down to 60 nN. The position-feedback sensors as well as the force sensor are calibrated by direct comparison with reference standards. A complete uncertainty analysis through the entire calibration chain based on the Monte Carlo method is presented. The functionality of the tensile tester is demonstrated by the automated stiffness measurement of the elongated cells in plant hairs (trichomes) as a function of their size. This enables a quantitative understanding and a model-based simulation of plant growth based on actual measurement data.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2067443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2067443","startPage":"1223","endPage":"1233","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5590382/05567125.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5590382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithically Integrated Two-Axis Microtensile Tester for the Mechanical Characterization of Microscopic Samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Monolithically Integrated Two-Axis Microtensile Tester for the Mechanical Characterization of Microscopic Samples","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567125/","accessionNumber":"11560110","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567125/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithically Integrated Two-Axis Microtensile Tester for the Mechanical Characterization of Microscopic Samples","sourcePdf":"jmems-muntwyler-2067443-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07443S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5590382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5590382","articleId":"5567125","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5567129,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Monzio Compagnoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Universities Nano-Electronics Team, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Monzio Compagnoni","id":"37284649300"},{"name":"Carmine Miccoli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Universities Nano-Electronics Team, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Carmine","lastName":"Miccoli","id":"37540566500"},{"name":"Andrea L.

Doping of CG polysilicon rules the reduction of the CG-to-FG capacitance when moving from the read to the program conditions, as a result of polysilicon depletion. The capacitance reduction is shown, however, to be nearly negligible for the EIS resulting from incremental step pulse programming, which, for the commonly adopted voltage steps, is mainly determined by the capacitance value in read conditions. Finally, the scaling trend of the CG-to-FG capacitance and of the EIS is addressed, discussing the evolution of the FG polysilicon in terms of geometry and dimensions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","volume":"31","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11597076","htmlLink":"/document/5567129/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impact of Control-Gate and Floating-Gate Design on the Electron-Injection Spread of Decananometer nand Flash Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Control-Gate and Floating-Gate Design on the Electron-Injection Spread of Decananometer nand Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"led-monziocompagnoni-2066253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048762S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5607217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5607217","articleId":"5567129","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5567132,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiana Bolchini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristiana","lastName":"Bolchini","id":"37273944700"},{"name":"Chiara Sandionigi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Sandionigi","id":"37540404700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0663"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0671"}],"articleNumber":"5567132","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":713},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567132","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Field programmable gate arrays","Classification algorithms","Space missions","Performance evaluation","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","radiation effects","space vehicle electronics","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault classification","SRAM-based FPGA","space environment","fault mitigation strategy","classification algorithm","recoverable faults","static random access memory","field-programmable gate arrays","radiation effects","aging mechanism","controller","fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerant systems","field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LES.2010.2073441","endPage":"110","startPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563995/5659701/05567132.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LES.2010.2073441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5659701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Classification for SRAM-Based FPGAs in the Space Environment for Fault Mitigation","abstract":"This letter proposes a classification algorithm to discriminate between recoverable and not recoverable faults occurring in static random access memory (SRAM)-based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), with the final aim of devising a methodology to enable the exploitation of these devices also in space applications, typically characterized by long mission times, where permanent faults become an issue.

Statistical ensembles of tens of thousands transistors have been simulated. Our analysis has been predominantly performed on a 35-nm channel-length bulk MOSFET test bed, widely used in previous studies to investigate the impact of different statistical variability sources. Comprehensive data mining and statistical analysis provide information about the shape of the distribution of the device threshold voltage, which is significantly non-Gaussian.

In the context of complex pathogenicity, Demodex folliculorum plays an important role showing significant density in the skin of patients with papulopustular rosacea. Rosacea belongs to the hard-to-heal diseases, and new approaches for treatment are strongly required. As atmospheric low-temperature plasma [atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ)] proved high efficacy against bacterial and fungal pathogens, we tested its potency as nonantibiotic-based method to inactivate Demodex folliculorum. We isolated five parasites of Demodex folliculorum from a 54-year-old patient suffering from chronic pustulous rosacea and irradiated the living parasites by APPJ ex vivo. The APPJ plasma killed Demodex folliculorum after an exposure time of 2 resp. 60 s. Low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma seems suitable for the treatment of dermatologic and veterinarian diseases caused by Demodex spp.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567169/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574197","volume":"38","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"In Vitro Activity of Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) Plasma Against Clinical Isolates of Demodex Folliculorum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In Vitro Activity of Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) Plasma Against Clinical Isolates of Demodex Folliculorum","sourcePdf":"tps-daeschlein-2061870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072525S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5596171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5596171","articleId":"5567169","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5567176,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyin Gong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wenyin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37530172800"},{"name":"Zhihua Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Cai","id":"37272968800"},{"name":"Charles X.

However, the choice of the best mutation strategy is difficult for a specific problem. To alleviate this drawback and enhance the performance of DE, in this paper, we present a family of improved DE that attempts to adaptively choose a more suitable strategy for a problem at hand. In addition, in our proposed strategy adaptation mechanism (SaM), different parameter adaptation methods of DE can be used for different strategies. In order to test the efficiency of our approach, we combine our proposed SaM with JADE, which is a recently proposed DE variant, for numerical optimization. Twenty widely used scalable benchmark problems are chosen from the literature as the test suit. Experimental results verify our expectation that the SaM is able to adaptively determine a more suitable strategy for a specific problem. Compared with other state-of-the-art DE variants, our approach performs better, or at least comparably, in terms of the quality of the final solutions and the convergence rate. Finally, we validate the powerful capability of our approach by solving two real-world optimization problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","volume":"41","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11862715","pubMedId":"20837448","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Differential Evolution With Adaptive Strategies for Numerical Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Differential Evolution With Adaptive Strategies for Numerical Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-gong-2056367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052903S","chronDate":"April  2011","isNumber":"5730604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"161","articleId":"5567176","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5567177,"authors":[{"name":"Moayed Daneshyari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA","Department of Technology, Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5730604/5567177/5567177-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moayed Daneshyari (M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995, the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, in 1998, and the M.S. degree in physics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","Since August 2008, he has been an Assistant Professor with Elizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, NC.

In order to judge the performance of THP applied as broadcast technique we finally determine the achievable user rates.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.080617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05567182.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.080617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","startPage":"3011","endPage":"3020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Required Transmit Power Applying Tomlinson-Harashima-Precoding in Scalar and MIMO Broadcast Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Required Transmit Power Applying Tomlinson-Harashima-Precoding in Scalar and MIMO Broadcast Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567182/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588269","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5567182/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Required Transmit Power Applying Tomlinson-Harashima-Precoding in Scalar and MIMO Broadcast Systems","sourcePdf":"3011-tc1010-huppert.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076648S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5567182","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5567183,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5601500/5567183/5567183-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xia Zheng received the B.S. degree in electronic and information engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2003 and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and information engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2009.

By avoiding major error-contributing TSs during the code construction process, codes with low error floors can effectively be built. In it has been shown that TSs labeled as [w;u] are considered as being equivalent under the automorphism of the graph and are therefore contributing equally to the error floor. However, TSs with the same label [w;u] are not identical in general, particularly for the case of irregular LDPC codes. In this paper, we introduce a parameter e that can identify the number of \"distinguishable\" cycles in the connected subgraph induced by an elementary trapping set. Further, we propose a code construction algorithm, namely the Progressive-Edge-Growth Approximate-minimum-Cycle-Set-Extrinsic-message-degree (PEG-ACSE) method, that aims to avoid small elementary trapping sets (ETSs), particularly detrimental ETSs. We also develop theorems evaluating the minimum possible ETSs formed by PEG construction algorithms in general. We compare the characteristics of the codes built using the proposed method and those built using PEG-only or PEG-Approximate-minimum-Cycle-Extrinsic-message-degree (PEG-ACE) methods. Results from simulations show that the codes constructed using the proposed PEG-ACSE method produce lower error rates, particularly at the high signal-to-noise (SNR) region, compared with codes constructed using other PEG-based algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.080638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05567183.pdf","startPage":"2823","endPage":"2834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.080638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing Short-Length Irregular LDPC Codes with Low Error Floor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"Constructing Short-Length Irregular LDPC Codes with Low Error Floor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567183/","publicationDate":"October 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11588274","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567183/","volume":"58","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing Short-Length Irregular LDPC Codes with Low Error Floor","sourcePdf":"2823-tc1010-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168991S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5567183","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5567184,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Hong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842400"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Division of Physical Science and Engineering, KAUST, Makkah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5567184","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Matrix decomposition","Multiplexing","Complexity theory","Antennas","MIMO","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Gaussian channels","iterative methods","matrix algebra","MIMO systems","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity non-iterative coordinated beamforming","multiplexing gain","MIMO systems","generalized eigenvector problem","Gaussian broadcast channels","iterative coordinated beamforming method","combining matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated beamforming","Gaussian broadcast channel","generalized eigenvector problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567184","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.090013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","abstract":"We propose a new non-iterative coordinated beamforming scheme to obtain full multiplexing gain in 2-user MIMO systems.

Optimal power spectral densities are characterized for the cognitive user so that the analog legacy user achieves a prescribed distortion constraint as measured by a mean-squared estimation error. As in Part I, it is demonstrated that through spectrum shaping, the cognitive user can transmit at its full available power and thereby achieve logarithmic growth of the cognitive transmission rate. Necessary conditions for the optimality of the spectrum shaping problem are investigated and under special conditions, low-complexity optimization algorithms are developed. A low-complexity sub-optimal solution corresponding to an on-off cognitive power spectral density is analyzed, and shown to be sufficient for attaining the logarithmic growth of cognitive transmission rates.

The impact of signaling schemes on the residual clipping noise power is studied via the symbol variance analysis. It is found that superposition coded modulation (SCM) can minimize the residual clipping noise power among all possible signaling schemes. This indicates that SCM-based OFDM systems are more robust to clipping effect than other alternatives when soft compensation is applied. It is also shown that a multi-code SCM scheme can further reduce the clipping effect and its overall performance can be quickly evaluated using a semi-analytical evolution method. Numerical examples are provided to verify the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05567189.pdf","startPage":"2861","endPage":"2870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.09296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.09296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Soft Compensation for OFDM Systems with Clipping and Superposition Coded Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Nonlinear distortion","Modulation","Peak to average power ratio","Iterative decoding","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","modulation coding","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative soft compensation method","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","clipping distortion","superposition coded modulation","symbol variance analysis","residual clipping noise power","signaling schemes","multicarrier transmission technique","broadband channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clipping","iterative decoding","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","soft compensation","superposition coded modulation (SCM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Soft Compensation for OFDM Systems with Clipping and Superposition Coded Modulation","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5567189/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588284","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Soft Compensation for OFDM Systems with Clipping and Superposition Coded Modulation","sourcePdf":"2861-tc1010-tong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144146S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5567189","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5567190,"authors":[{"name":"Nihar Jindal","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5601500/5567190/5567190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nihar Jindal (S'99-M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

The achievable pilot-based spectral efficiency is expanded with respect to the fading rate about the no-fading point, which leads to an accurate order expansion for the pilot overhead. This expansion identifies that the pilot overhead, as well as the spectral efficiency penalty with respect to a reference system with genie-aided CSI (channel state information) at the receiver, depend on the square root of the normalized Doppler frequency. It is also shown that the widely-used block fading model is a special case of more accurate continuous fading models in terms of the achievable pilot-based spectral efficiency. Furthermore, it is established that the overhead optimization for multiantenna systems is effectively the same as for single-antenna systems with the normalized Doppler frequency multiplied by the number of transmit antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.090696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.083110.090696","startPage":"2939","endPage":"2948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5601500/05567190.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5601500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Treatment of Optimum Pilot Overhead in Multipath Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Treatment of Optimum Pilot Overhead in Multipath Fading Channels","volume":"58","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588287","publicationDate":"October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5567190/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Treatment of Optimum Pilot Overhead in Multipath Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2939-tc1010-jindal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097425S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5601500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5601500","articleId":"5567190","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5567193,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ali Boujelben","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Mohamed Ali Boujelben received the Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur from the Higher School of Communication of Tunisia, SUP'COM, in 2009.","He is currently an engineer with Orange Telecommunications Group, Tunisia."]},"firstName":"Mohamed Ali","lastName":"Boujelben","id":"37408902500"},{"name":"Faouzi Bellili","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5567193/5567193-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Faouzi Bellili was born in Sbeitla, Kasserine, Tunisia, on June 16, 1983.

Under constant channels and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), we first derive the DA maximum-likelihood (ML) SNR estimator in closed-form expression. The performance of the DA ML estimator is analytically carried out by deriving the closed-form expression of its bias and variance. Besides, in order to compare its performance with the fundamental limit, we derive the DA Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in closed-form expression. In the NDA case, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived to iteratively maximize the log-likelihood function. The performance of the NDA ML estimator is empirically assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, we introduce an efficient algorithm, which applies to any one/two-dimensional \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-ary constellation, to numerically compute the NDA CRLBs. In this paper, the noise components are assumed to be spatially uncorrelated over all the antenna elements and temporally white. In both cases, we show that our new inphase and quadrature I/Q-based estimators offer substantial performance improvements over the single-input single-output (SISO) ML SNR estimator due to the optimal usage of the statistical dependence between the antenna branches, and that it reaches the corresponding CRLB over a wide SNR range. We also show that the use of the I/Q-based ML estimators can lead to remarkable performance improvements over the moment-based estimators for the same antenna-array size. Moreover, it is shown that SIMO configurations can contribute to decreasing the required number of iterations of the EM algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SNR Estimation Over SIMO Channels From Linearly Modulated Signals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2074197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05567193.pdf","startPage":"6017","endPage":"6028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2074197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"SNR Estimation Over SIMO Channels From Linearly Modulated Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5567193/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641772","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNR Estimation Over SIMO Channels From Linearly Modulated Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-bellili-2074197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134643S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5567193","onlineDate":"09 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5567233,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Tieqiang","affiliation":["College of Information, Hebei Polytechnic University, Tangshan, China"],"lastName":"Sun Tieqiang","id":"37540555700"},{"name":"Zhang Lei","affiliation":["College of Computer and Automatic Control, Hebei Polytechnic University, Tangshan, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Lei","id":"37538444000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7390-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7387-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7389-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5567233","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"abstract":"Blast furnace top gas recovery turbine unit, TRT for short, is an energy saving system.

Multi-spectral images contain a great deal of spectral information, whereas SAR images contain rich texture information, such as buildings and road network. SAR and TM images fusion based on the wavelet transform ensure the fusion image showing more spatial detail, not only conserving the spectral information of the multi-spectral images and reducing the distortions as well, but also highlighting the texture information of the SAR image. In this paper, the wavelet transform-based image fusion methods by using SAR and TM multi-spectral images are implemented by Mallat and \u00e0 trous algorithms separately. Before the image fusion, both of the SAR and TM images have to be geographic coordinate registered in order to they having the same pixel size. In wavelet decomposition, the decomposition level is determined by statistical of entropy value. According to SAR and TM image fusion based on wavelet transform, it can be seen that the fusion image is greatly improved and both of spectral and textural information are enhanced. The value of entropy, variance, average gradient and correlation coefficients of the fusion image are analyzed for two different algorithms evaluation. By analyzing the results, It can be concluded that the image fusion by \u00e0 trous wavelet transform has a good effect in experiment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559273/5567473/05567653.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics","doi":"10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5567473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-spectral and SAR images fusion via Mallat and \u00c0 trous wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image fusion","Entropy","Spatial resolution","Approximation algorithms","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","geophysical techniques","image fusion","image texture","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multispectral image fusion","SAR imags fusion","synthetic aperture radar","texture information","TM images","wavelet transform","spectral information","Mallat algorithm","a trous algorithm","correlation coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SAR and multi-spectral image fusion","Mallat algorithm","\u00e0trous algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-spectral and SAR images fusion via Mallat and \u00c0 trous wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5567653/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11532477","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-spectral and SAR images fusion via Mallat and \u00c0 trous wavelet transform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"geoinformatics2010submission563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093514S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559273","isNumber":"5567473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559273","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5567473","articleId":"5567653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5567696,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Chen","affiliation":["Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37067282900"},{"name":"Lina Tang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Tang","id":"37532397300"},{"name":"Quanyi Qiu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Quanyi","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37529162900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7303-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7301-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7302-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"}],"articleNumber":"5567696","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploitation of CBERS-02B as auxiliary data in recovering the Landsat7 ETM+ SLC-off image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5567696","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Accuracy","Satellites","Earth","Remote sensing","Reflectivity","Filling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical image processing","data acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CBERS-02B as auxiliary data","Landsat7 ETM+ SLC-off image","scan line corrector","enhanced thematic mapper plus sensor","Landsat7 satellite","data acquisition","China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite-02B","global linear histogram match","localized linear histogram match","adaptive window linear histogram match","urban impervious surface","linear spectral mixture model","IKONOS image"]}],"abstract":"The scan-line corrector (SLC) for the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, on board the Landsat7 satellite, have failed probably permanently since May 31, 2003. The consequence of the SLC failure (denoted SLC-off) is that approximately 20% of the pixels in an ETM+ image are not scanned, which hampers the use of the data accordingly. To improve the usability of the ETM+ SLC-off data, several researches relating to the gap-fill algorithms have been conducted with acceptable accuracy. Due to the limitation of data acquisition, e.g. temporal resolution and atmospheric condition, there are always a large number of overlapping areas filled with un-scanned pixels in two cloud-free ETM+ SLC-off images which are close in time. Consequently, the recovering procedure would be unavailable through general gap-fill algorithms. The bands similarity between China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite-02B (CBERS-02B) and Landsat7 ETM+, particularly for the visible/near-infrared bands, makes it possible to estimate the un-scanned pixels in the ETM+ SLC-off image considering the close time CBERS-02B as auxiliary data. In this paper, CBERS-02B(acquired on January 17, 2009) was taken as auxiliary data to fill the un-scanned pixels in two ETM+ SLC-off images(acquired on January 21, 2009 and November 5, 2009 respectively) with the suitable gap-fill algorithms. Four gap-fill algorithms were practiced and compared, which called simple filling (Simple), global linear histogram match (GLHM), localized linear histogram match (LLHM), and adaptive window linear histogram match (AWLHM) respectively. In contrast to Simple, GLHM and LLHM, AWLHM took into account the number of effective pixels as well as the impact of local conditions. Therefore, while ignoring computing speed or time consumption, AWLHM was a generally superior method with higher accuracy to others. Lastly, taking Xiamen Island as a study region, we used the recovered ETM+ data filled by AWLHM to extract urban impervious surface (UIS) at sub-pixel scale, adopting the selective endmember linear spectral mixture model (LSMM). The accuracy of UIS estimation was validated using a sharpened IKONOS image with spatial resolution of 1m(acquired on January 18, 2009). Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the scanned and filled (un-scanned in original ETM+ SLC-off image) pixels, in view of the estimation accuracy of UIS. In conclusion, CBERS-02B should be regarded as usefully auxiliary data so as to recover the ETM+ SLC-off image and enable more scientific use of the data.","doi":"10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567696","publicationTitle":"2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 18th International Conference on Geoinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5559273/5567473/05567696.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5567473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5567696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploitation of CBERS-02B as auxiliary data in recovering the Landsat7 ETM+ SLC-off image","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11532195","htmlLink":"/document/5567696/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploitation of CBERS-02B as auxiliary data in recovering the Landsat7 ETM+ SLC-off image","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"geoinformatics2010submission178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062168S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559273","isNumber":"5567473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559273","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5567473","articleId":"5567696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5567777,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayuan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jiayuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404496900"},{"name":"Heping Tao","affiliation":["Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Heping","lastName":"Tao","id":"37401269800"},{"name":"Yangchun Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yangchun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540182300"},{"name":"Zhou Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401355100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7303-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7301-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7302-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"}],"articleNumber":"5567777","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":922},"abstract":"Mountain disasters like landslides occur frequently in Southwest China. Hence, it is urgent to timely conduct geological survey in disastrous region and take necessary measures to treat identified hazards. Field survey is reliable but too expensive and time-consuming. Satellite or manned aerial remote sensing have the advantages of region-scale coverage and moderate timeliness, but restricted by the factors of mist, image resolution, human safety, and cost. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is a very promising approach for rapid disaster investigation in regional scope, as giving consideration to both accuracy and spatial coverage.

satellite images in urban area: Assessing the quality of resulting images","abstract":"The fusion of panchromatic and multispectral satellite images is an important issue in many remote sensing applications, especially in urban area. The popular image fusion methods in remote sensing community usually distort the spectral characteristics. To reduce the spectral distortion, some image fusion techniques have been developed. This paper addresses the issue in quality assessment of fused images from three recently developed methods. These are synthetic variable ratio (SVR), smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM) and Gram_Schimdt transform (GS). We employed these methods in image fusion of Landsat 7 ETM+ panchromatic with multispectral images and Quickbird panchromatic with multispectral images. The quantitative methods such as standard deviation, information entropy, correlation coefficient, and spectral bias index were used to assess the quality of fused images. The results indicate that different approaches have their specific properties and adapt to different purposes based on spectral fidelity and high spatial frequency information gain. The quality of fused images based on SFIM and SVR methods is better than that of GS method, respectively, in mediumresolution images and high-resolution images in urban area. Therefore, the SFIM and SVR methods can meet the needs of mapping-oriented fusion, classification-oriented fusion, and visualization-oriented fusion purposes, respectively in mediumresolution images and high-resolution images in urban area.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5568105/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11532345","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5568105/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","conferenceDate":"18-20 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fusion of satellite images in urban area: Assessing the quality of resulting images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of satellite images in urban area: Assessing the quality of resulting images","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"geoinformatics2010submission767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042199S","chronDate":"18-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5559273","isNumber":"5567473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5559273","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5567473","articleId":"5568105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":5568111,"authors":[{"name":"Song Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Gao","id":"37536094900"},{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37533938900"},{"name":"Yong Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37279235500"},{"name":"Yinle Sun","affiliation":["School of Geography and Remote Sensing Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinle","lastName":"Sun","id":"37536870700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7303-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7301-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7302-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-024X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-0258"}],"articleNumber":"5568111","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Computer architecture","Spatial databases","Cloud computing","Servers","Security","Memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geographic information systems","Internet","query processing","software architecture","virtual storage","Web services","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RESTful style digital gazetteer service","cloud computing environment","geographical knowledge informed digital gazetteer service","Web service","XML based access interfaces","data storage","Web pages","query efficiency requirements","resources oriented architecture","MapReduce"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","digital cazetteer service","RSET","MapReduce"]}],"abstract":"The geographical knowledge-informed digital gazetteer service (KIDGS) is a standard web service that provides unified XML-based access interfaces for various applications.

Assuming that the same source can exhibit signals having similar shape, those which show different shapes i.e. different frequency spectrum, are grouped differently in this space.

The Hadoop implementation of MapReduce is one of the most popular tools for many programmers due its ability to hide details of parallel programming from the users. However work on simulating the Hadoop environment is still in its infancy. Although there are a large number of simulating tools available to simulate distributed environments. However there are only a few simulators available which specifically targets the MapReduce environment. Based on testing we performed; the usability of these simulators is not satisfactory due to the simplified design which limits simulating jobs with variance configurations. We have designed and implemented a MapReduce simulator based on discrete event simulation called MRSim which accurately simulate the Hadoop environment. The simulator on one hand allows us to measure scalability of MapReduce based applications easily and quickly, on the other hand captures the effects of different configurations of Hadoop setup on MapReduce based applications behavior in terms of Hadoop job completion times and hardware utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRSim: A discrete event based MapReduce simulator","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569086","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562238/5569072/05569086.pdf","startPage":"2993","endPage":"2997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569086","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5569086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"MRSim: A discrete event based MapReduce simulator","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5569086/","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11526351","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRSim: A discrete event based MapReduce simulator","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"639.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046561S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562238","isNumber":"5569072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562238","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5569072","articleId":"5569086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5569093,"authors":[{"name":"Jinxiang Chen","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","State Key Laboratory of Intelligence Technology and Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinxiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539225300"},{"name":"Fuchun Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligence Technology and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fuchun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37279269000"},{"name":"Changjun Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Changjun Hu","id":"37539066200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5934-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5931-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5933-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5569093","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569093","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Nonlinear systems","Robustness","Fuzzy systems","Linear matrix inequalities","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","feedback","fuzzy control","H\u221e control","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","H\u221e control","nonlinear systems","static output feedback","linear matrix inequality","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model","Lyapunov functional method","closed-loop system","asymptotically stable"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the problem of static output feedback H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n control for a class of nonlinear systems via a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach.

Besides, multi-population parallel evolution and optimum individual transplant strategy are adopted to merge optimum individual keeping and gene keeping effectively. Crossover probability and mutation probability are adjusted adaptively according to population diversity and more reasonable target characteristics variable is designed according to the features of infrared images.

However sometimes it is very difficult to find a suitable prototype for representing a cluster with an arbitrary shape. One possible solution is to employ multi-prototype instead. In this paper, we propose a minimum spanning tree (MST) based multi-prototype clustering algorithm. It is a split and merge scheme. In the split stage, the suitable patterns are determined to be prototypes in terms of their degrees in the corresponding MST. Then the fake prototypes in sparse density regions are recognized and removed. In the merge stage, a two-step merge strategy is designed to group the prototypes. The proposed algorithm can deal with datasets consisting of clusters with different shapes, sizes and densities. The experiment results show the effectiveness on the synthetic and real datasets.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569359","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562238/5569323/05569359.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569323","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-prototype clustering algorithm based on minimum spanning tree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multi-prototype clustering algorithm based on minimum spanning tree","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5569359/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11526685","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5569359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-prototype clustering algorithm based on minimum spanning tree","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054514S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562238","isNumber":"5569323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562238","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5569323","articleId":"5569359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5569361,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279458500"},{"name":"Huajun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Technology Center, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Huajun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539412300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5934-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5931-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5933-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5569361","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569361","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Control systems","Mathematical model","Fuzzy control","Robustness","Computational modeling","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","ships","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","ship course control system","ship dynamic properties","internal model control","zero steady-state error controller design","closed control system","course change rate","course response curves","fuzzy rules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","ship","internal model control","course control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569361","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562238/5569069/05569361.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","startPage":"752","endPage":"756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of fuzzy neural network in ship course control system","abstract":"When ship docks at harbor or other sea area, both the robustness and dynamic properties of course control system are required strictly. Because the model parameters are relative to the speed and load of the ship, it is difficult to design a good controller based on the ship model. This paper combines internal model control with fuzzy neural network to design a course system. First, it designs a zero steady-state error controller which ensures robustness of the course control system relay on inner model. For the zero steady-state error controller, it is necessary to reduce the dynamic properties of the control system to ensure the robustness. Thus, this paper uses fuzzy neural network to adjust the pole sites of the closed control system based on the ship course and course change rate. It designs a new structure of fuzzy neural network which uses neural network to represent the fuzzy rules. According to expert experiences, it also gives out the weights computation method of fuzzy neural adjuster. At last, the hybrid course control system is applied in a actual ship and the course response curves indicate that the course control system possess good robustness and dynamic properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5569361/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11526273","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5569361/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The application of fuzzy neural network in ship course control system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of fuzzy neural network in ship course control system","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062028S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562238","isNumber":"5569069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562238","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5569069","articleId":"5569361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5569371,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Chen","affiliation":["International School of Software, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37069800800"},{"name":"Bo Han","affiliation":["International School of Software, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Han","id":"37537314100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5934-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5931-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5933-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5569371","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569371","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Shape","Data mining","Software","Presses","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-means clustering","audio data","reasonable sampling-rate","data clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clustering","K-means","sampling-rate","starting points","audio"]}],"abstract":"K-means clustering is sensitive to starting points and its time cost is expensive for large scale of data, such as audio.

The procedure progressively increases sampling-rates and choose the cluster centers in the previous stage as the starting points for next clustering. The resulted relationship curve between sampling-rate and iteration number illustrates a turning point as reasonable sampling-rate.

Obviously, the construction of such a model makes use of a data sample of such metrics from analogous past projects. However, incomplete data often appear in such data samples. Worse still, the necessity to include a particular continuous predictor metric or a particular category for a certain categorical predictor metric is most likely based on an experience-related intuition that the continuous predictor metric or the category matters to the target metric. However, in the presence of incomplete data, this intuition is traditionally not verifiable \u201cretrospectively\u201d after the model is constructed, leading to redundant continuous predictor metric(s) and/or excessive categorization for categorical predictor metrics. As an improvement of the author's previous work to solve all these problems, this paper proposes a methodology incorporating the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) multiple imputation method, kernel smoothing, Monte Carlo simulation, and stepwise regression.

A robust controller is used to compensate the lumped errors, and all parameter adaptive laws are adjusted by the filtered tracking errors.

This paper addresses fuzzy information extraction and granular computing in granular neural networks in order that fuzzy rules can be discovered from fuzzy information which is difficult to be measured accurately with numerical data and furthermore the missing data can be predicted. An information table is modeled and the relation embedded in data has been discovered through granulation. A fuzzy neural network model is proposed to learn with a given fuzzy information table in crisp granular neural network and fuzzy granular neural network respectively, then to predict missing rules in a larger scale information table. The conclusion based on experiments is that granular neural networks can be used in knowledge discovery embedded in fuzzy data base and granular computing is accomplished. The developed techniques have promising applications in stock-markets forecasting especially expressing not only technical factors but also fundamental aspects which are hard to be quantified.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569627","startPage":"412","endPage":"418","publicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2010.5569627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569595","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Seventh International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562238/5569595/05569627.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Granular neural networks computing on fuzzy information table","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5569627/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Granular neural networks computing on fuzzy information table","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5569627/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11526769","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","conferenceDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Granular neural networks computing on fuzzy information table","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"P91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.177809S","chronDate":"10-12 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562238","isNumber":"5569595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562238","xplore-issue":"5569595","articleId":"5569627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5569641,"authors":[{"name":"Shiping Du","affiliation":["College of Biology and Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Yaan, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Shiping","lastName":"Du","id":"37537025200"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["College of Biology and Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Yaan, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539033000"},{"name":"Yuming Wei","affiliation":["Triticeae Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Yaan, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Wei","id":"37539648200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5934-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5931-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5933-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5569641","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Markov processes","Training","Probability distribution","Data models","Entropy","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","fuzzy set theory","hidden Markov models","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy third-order hidden Markov models","matrix data","statistical modelling techniques","pattern recognition","fuzzy c-means technique","fuzzy entropy technique","generalised fuzzy objective function","2D hidden Markov model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hidden Markov models","state matrices","observation matrices","fuzzy c-means","fuzzy entropy"]}],"abstract":"A generalised fuzzy approach to statistical modelling techniques for pattern recognition is proposed in this paper.

We focus on \\emph{large and sparse} information and we propose to exploit the compressive sensing (CS) theory to efficiently collect and pro-actively disseminate this information across a large overlay network. We devise an approach based on random walks (RW) to spread CS random combinations to participants in a random peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network. CS allows the peer to compress the RW payload in a distributed fashion: given a constraint on the RW size, e.g., the maximum UDP packet payload size, this amounts to being able to distribute larger information and to guarantee that a large fraction of the global information is obtained by each peer. We analyze the performance of the proposed method by means of a simple (yet accurate) analytical model describing the structure of the so called CS sensing matrix in presence of peer dynamics and communication link failures. We validate our model predictions against a simulator of the system at the peer and network level on different models of random overlay networks. The model we developed can be exploited to select the parameters of the RW and the criteria to build the sensing matrix in order to achieve successful information recovery. Finally, a prototype has been developed and deployed over the PlanetLab network to prove the feasibility of the proposed approach in a realistic environment. Our analysis reveals that the method we propose is feasible, accurate and robust to peer and information dynamics. We also argue that centralized and other distributed approaches, i.e., flooding and gossiping, are unfit in the context we consider.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Access to Sparse and Large Global Information in P2P Networks: A Case for Compressive Sensing","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Tenth International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (P2P)","doi":"10.1109/P2P.2010.5569971","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Tenth International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (P2P)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5569876/5569954/05569971.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/P2P.2010.5569971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5569971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5569971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Local Access to Sparse and Large Global Information in P2P Networks: A Case for Compressive Sensing","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5569971/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11526886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Access to Sparse and Large Global Information in P2P Networks: A Case for Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"01-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103941S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5569876","isNumber":"5569954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5569876","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5569954","articleId":"5569971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
